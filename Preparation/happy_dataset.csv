happy,"Getting groceries with my(31) wife(29) and our 3 month old baby yesterday, I saw a kid standing in the middle of the aisle blocking someone trying to get their cart through. He turned and noticed them, stepped to the side and said ""oh excuse me!"". The parent around our age said ""good job (kids name) that was very polite!"". He said ""thanks, we have to think about other people too right?"", to which she replied ""that's exactly right"" and gave him a firm one arm hug.

Thinking about that this morning, it makes me so happy to see people teaching compassion and thoughtfulness nowadays. She seemed to be very involved as a parent, and I can't wait to be/teach that way for our daughter. Idk why but that thought is hitting that happy cord so hard today, just felt like sharing!"
happy,"Sorry for my bad english. I am a 23 year old guy, i work as a security guard in south america and live far from my family. I have an older sister (28 and works as a party organiser) and a younger brother (9 almost 10) who i love more than myself, i chat from time to time with my older sister since we both know the other is probably busy, on the other hand i play videogames with my brother almost every day and since he is young i play better than him (im not the best but i have been playing for many years now)we have tons of fun and he gets very sad when i have to leave, he joined my discord server along with my friends who are around my same age and he try to keep up with us as much as he can (i gifted him ""ForHonor"" and he is very good at it). Yesterday my older sister asked me about my pfp on discord (an ia image a friend made for me combining my gamertag ""turtle"" and a spacemarine from 40k) so i told her and she asked for the original picture, so i sent it to her along with some pther similar ones. When i sked what they were for she told me that our brother wanted a birthday party... and the theme was me... i expected a spiderman party or something like that. I cant belive how much that little guy loves me and looks up to me. He makes me the happyest brother."
happy,"So I'm 16 and over 300lbs, and yesterday I made a post about me taking my first proper walk in over a year. Y'all made me feel so seen, I felt like I wasn't alone in this journey and I'm appreciative of all of you. I want to make an update everyday to hold myself accountable in a public space. I hope that my posts can inspire just 1 person to start doing the same. Cheers!"
happy,"What's so special about an office snack drawer?

It sounds funny but I have dreamed of having my own snack drawer at my own desk in my own office for as long as I can remember.  While I may not have my own office, I have a nice cubicle next to a large set of windows in the corner of the building.  It's wonderful!

I spent the better part of a decade getting an undergraduate engineering degree and graduated at 33 while working to support myself and doing extracurricular projects.  There were so many times I just wanted to quit.  I moved around a lot and changed majors at one point so it took a while to get through it all but I did it.  I now work for a company that I've always wanted to work for and I have myself a snack drawer.

It's silly but this snack drawer reminds me of all the blood, sweat, and tears that went into getting my degree and I just feel so accomplished when I turn around, open it, and grab some crackers.  I've come so far since I was waiting tables with no direction in life and it's a nice reminder that all the hard work paid off.  I can't help but smile when I think about it.  Lmao, sounds so weird typing it out but it makes me so happy!"
happy,We had a long and semi mild winter but with the freezes and thaws it's taken my garden to bloom any flowers. These daffodils are usually also eaten or picked by my children so this has been so nice to enjoy their beautiful blooms.
happy,Let’s go weekend !!
happy,"I'm a few states away from home for a conference this week, and during some downtime I looked up things to do nearby. Turns out the art museum a short walk away had my FAVORITE sculpture on display, I didn't even know it had been put into a collection! 

L' Amante by Beth Cavener is every bit as beautiful in real life as I could have imagined and I am SO excited to have been able to marvel at it with my own two eyes!"
happy,"I’m so excited! I’m currently about to book my flight to Tulum Mexico for a 5 day stay at the Temple Tulum so yeah I’m having all reasons to feel good right now despite all the shreds life had to throw my way recently! #happy! 
"
happy,"my boyfriend and i are both 16. were immature, sometimes a little petty, but undoubtedly in love. my mother died before i met him, but since he’s known me he’s supported me through the grief of losing her and even has visited her grave by himself on his own time. he helps me talk about her, and says that he wishes he could have known her. it means more than he knows.

i come from a drug addict mother and angry father, so my model for a relationship wasn’t the best. i’ve messed up with him, i’ve said things i didn’t mean when i was upset, but he’s been nothing but patient with me. he’s taught me how to talk things out and admit when i’m upset about something, and to not harbor my emotions.

he’s making me a better person, and i love him unconditionally. he’s the first person i’ve been comfortable enough to let him see every single side of me, mentally and behaviorally. anyways, just wanted to say there are still good people out there, and everyone deserves someone who treats them the way my boyfriend treats me!! "
happy,She's old enough to follow along and we played a cupcake gathering boardgame. I grew up playing lots of games and I'm just so psyched about more! We followed about 90% of the rules and we had a blast!
happy,"23 Male and going through a Major Depression to the point I rarely get out of my bed unless I have to go to my shitty job.

I was just endlessly scrolling when I got a call from an old highschool friend of mine. What's funny is that I've always wanted to contact my old highschool friends but insecurities and self doubt always gets the better of me.

He called me to ask how I was doing, and of course I lied and said I was doing OK. He said he was doing fine too and we talked for a bit. And he also asked that we should hang out sometime, and said sure. 

I know it might seem sad and pathetic to be happy over a call but that made me feel good."
happy,"Over 2 years ago, a friend of ours passed away leaving 3 kids orphaned and a half sibling without a support system. My wife and I took in all 4 kids, as we were quite close with the kids. We got legal guardianship of the 2 youngest about 6 months after they moved in. The youngest is now 10. She started calling my wife ""Mommy"" about a year ago. This took some getting used to as all of our other kids call her ""Mom"". 

I however, remained Mr. MyFirstName. She has never had a dad before, and she had always called me that before she moved in. She gives me hugs everyday (now) and tells me she loves me frequently (yes, I know this won't last). So I was not worried about what she calls me. We went on a trip with my brother and his family, and sometime during the week, she just started calling me ""Daddy"". I'm not sure if it was because her cousin (my niece - 6F) calls my brother Daddy (a lot) or what caused it. At one point, we were at a theme park, and she was calling me Daddy over and over again, and I completely missed it, because I wasn't used to it and her voice is similar to my niece. My SIL grabs my arm and says ""Daddy!!!  Someone is calling you"". I felt awful, and so overjoyed at the same time. We've been home several days and I'm still Daddy (and getting used to it), but also Mr. MyFirstName sometimes too, but it still makes me smile.

  
We are hoping the adoption will be finalized this year. "
happy,Family dog didn't want to come inside from the snow. So I took a break from work and spent some quality time appreciating the outdoors. I'm glad I trusted his instinct.
happy,Mum has been helping me orchestrate so she knows I'm coming back- I haven't seen my family since Christmas and I've especially missed my little sister so I decided instead of staying at uni for reading week I'm gonna go home and surprise her!
happy,"Writing this while sitting beside my mom.😃

Just got home from a different city where i stay for studies but not very far. *When i live alone, i do the most idiotic things.* However, I slept happy and relieved yesterday thinking how i finally got time to get back home to my family. I woke up pretty late but was so happy and did all the chores then got ready. I feel at peace, no pain, no stress, no regrets, just pure serenity. I just needed to share it becos this is rare. I don't feel the best these days so i'm very grateful to be happy today all becos i'm home, sweet home, sweet parents. It felt really good to see my parents after a couple of months, i know it's not been long but it felt like forever. Saw my brother, his smile as bright as a sunny day. Before i return back to feeling shitty, I wanna thank universe for whatever i have today and for this life:)

Lastly, thank you sm for reading."
happy,Me and my wife have been together 20 years in October and married 16 in November. As long as I've known her she's been a smoker. I was a smoker myself. I finally kicked the habit three years ago. Bur my wife has been incredibly stubborn on the subject. Today we talked for a while and she decided to take steps to quit. I couldn't be happier with this decision. I'm aware that this will not he easy but she's at least willing. And I'm gonna stand by her and take all the crap that comes with quitting. If it means she can improve her health and I can have her longer I am more than willing to be her punching bag for a few weeks. I'm very proud because she really didn't want to do this.

happy,"I know it’s probably not a crazy good accomplishment; especially because I know I’ve hurt people before, but I’m still proud of myself nonetheless. 

I used to be defensive, snappy, and easy to push into sadness or anger. This was due some previous life experiences. Which doesn’t make it okay. It never does, but I feel like me getting better and being a better friend and person to those around me is a sign that I’m moving on from that. I’m healing. :)

I’ve been in and out of therapy my whole life; which never really worked until I became an adult and was able to truly think for myself and be myself. 
Now; after two years of panic attacks and mental decline, I think I’m finally getting better. I’m kinder, I’m more generous, I’m able to take criticism. I’m still sensitive, but I try to remember the intention of others before reacting in anyway. I’ve also learned to take time for myself incase my emotions get too high. (Something I was INCAPABLE of doing before) 

Okay, sorry for the wall of text; I’m just happy to be doing better. Thank you, if you made it this far. 

Remember to be kind not only to others, but also to yourself. :)"
happy,"I've resisted unhealthy snacks today!

I've resisted, even though I've been tempted to have some because I'm quite hungry. I'm so happy, because I've gained almost 20kg due to my pregnancy and I desperately want to lose it so that I can feel good about myself again. 

Also, I plan on exercising today, even though it's hard to make time for myself. I've been so incredibly depressed after giving birth and, despite my hunger now, I'm not going to give in to having a snack because then I'm never going to make progress. 

I'm tired of disappointing myself and avoiding looking in the mirror. Today, skipping snacks and exercising is a small step in the right direction. I'm taking things one day at a time, one small step at a time. Please wish me luck! :)"
happy,"I'm so so happy I looks at wedding photos and FEEL how much he loves me, how happy I am!"
happy,Started the year making better changes. Ive lost 19lbs in total since January.
happy,"I love reddit podcasts, but they can be so saddening, especially the stories about pulling ""pranks"" like lying about tragedies or physical harm. I love to do the complete opposite with my boyfriend, and last night was my favorite. He woke up yesterday and the first thing he said to me was ""I am craving white birthday cake."" so I figured, what's a birthday cake without a birthday party? Here's the prank... his birthday is in July. We gave him the ultimate surprise birthday party when he got off his mother's day restaurant shift."
happy,"Edgar (the raven) and Wartholomew (the frog) are Halloween decorations that I've had for a long while and dress in different costumes throughout the year (ex. holidays). They sit in our living room window facing the street.

I've had Edgar since 2020 & Wart since Summer 2023. I dress them in pet costumes (usually for cats or smaller pets like rodents/lizards) since they normally fit the best. 😀

Hope you guys like this! 😊"
happy," 

On Feb 15th I was 214 pounds . Went on a low calorie diet and eating only once or twice a day of lean chicken and 3 veggies and only drinking water/water with no sugar flavoring. 40 minutes at 3mph daily on the treadmill and 20 minutes daily of benchpresses and curls . Today I'm at 198 !!!!!!! Still got a ways to go my goal is 180 but getting there!!!!

I'm excited."
happy,"We (24F) and (22M) met on an app called Yocket, which is popular in India for graduate abroad studies. One day, she texted in the group about the decision deadline for a particular university. I saw the message and made a joke, which made her laugh. Intrigued, I wanted to learn more about her, so I checked out her profile. It turned out she had applied and got an admit from the same university where I had applied.

I decided to direct message her, asking about her application process and the decision. What started as professional college talk gradually turned into more personal conversations about our day-to-day activities and common interests. It all began on March 19th, 2023. Her age-related freakouts, even when we were just friends, were adorable.

By July, we found ourselves flirting without even fully knowing that we were “flirting”. We gave each other nicknames—I call her Goldie, and she calls me Twee. The nicknames stemmed from a funny story; she forgot few things, so I jokingly called her Goldfish (with its 15-second memory), which eventually led to Goldie. Twee came from star > twinkle > twee; she called me Starfish (with no brain) after I said something silly.

As I was about to fly to the USA for my higher studies on August 8th and yeah she couldn’t make it this year cause of some personal reasons, she sent me a long, heartfelt text when I was at the airport. It made me realize I was leaving something behind in India, even though my dream was to live in the USA. The text stirred emotions in me that I had never felt before.In the USA, I struggled to express my feelings or ask her out, but on August 13th, I finally did it, and she said, ""Fuck yes."" Despite not meeting or speaking on calls, we texted for hours every day. However, we knew long-distance wouldn't work without meeting in person, so I decided to visit her after my first semester, which was six months away. We didn't meet before I flew to the USA because I'm from a city that's 350 kilometers away from hers, and we also didn't acknowledge our feelings while I was living in India. We regretted that after August too much, and it was hilarious.

After a month, we started doing calls and decided to meet in person, skipping video calls and only sharing pictures. Although we knew we were in love, we didn't say it outright; instead, we used phrases like ""I purple you"" and ""I l you."" Purple became our color because One day, while I was assisting her with the application process, she thanked me with a purple heart instead of a red one. Later, she revealed that she didn't want to give the ""wrong impression"" by sending red hearts lol. From that moment on, purple became our color in everything, from hearts to flowers and to act more goofy, like Avengers' ""I love you 3000,"" we chose 2468 as our special number.

In January, I flew to India, and on the 6th, we finally met. It was nerve-wracking as she sat at Cubbon Park in Bangalore, facing away from the entrance which was extremely adorable. When I tapped her shoulder, she turned and we hugged for solid two minutes which was the best moment of my life. I spent the entire January with her, When we began our personal conversations, we discovered a shared love for a special dessert: blueberry cheesecake. We always dreamt of sharing it in person, so after 6-7 months of anticipation, we finally had our first cheesecake date in January. We also exchanged bouquets of purple flowers and now that I've flown back to the US, I miss my baby Gold so much. I just wanna be with her all the time. I love her 2468."
happy,"After being rejected for an early admission, and direct admission, I still tried to appeal for a third time to get into the college course I wanted. I just got the results that I was SUCCESSFUL!!!!!! I'M SO HAPPY I'M CRYING I MADE IT I MADE IT. I had absolutely no hope for if i didn't get accepted and was considering giving up entirely"
happy,ALPACAS!!!!! (:
happy,"This is gonna start off sad, but I swear it gets better. 

August 2021 I graduated college. October 2021 I was given a job offer for a career I was incredibly excited about. The job offer payed decently, and was a stepping stone for my ex-gf and I at the time to be able to start moving our relationship into a more adult-relationship; ie, moving out, buying a house, etc. 

January 2022 I started at my job and loved it. March 2022 came around, and my ex at the time had blind-sided me and left without a word. I was devastated at the time. Fast forward a few months to October, I’m at the gym and I feel a tendon in the back of my leg snap. I can’t walk. I eventually go to the doctor who just diagnoses me with a strain and tells me to go to PT. 

Long story short, I visited 2 different doctors. Both of whom could not give me a proper diagnosis which caused the PT I received to only make things worse. I was on disability from my job to take care of my leg which just wouldn’t get better, as well as therapy for depression. Eventually, I was forced to leave my job, lost my health insurance, and didn’t know if I’d ever be able to walk again. I was alone, depressed, disabled, unemployed, and had no idea about the future and what was going to happen to me. 

Eventually, I found a physio who I was able to see via Zoom (about $20/visit, so I could afford it without insurance) who was able to diagnose me and we started a PT program that I was able to do by myself. It took a long time, but she got me back on my feet, back in the gym, back to running and everything. It took me about a year to walk again. It was an extremely long process. 

Near the end of my PT, I met this woman. Smart, funny, gorgeous, kind, driven and hard working, incredibly emotionally intelligent, and… well I could go on for hours talking about this woman. We hit it off, and started dating. She’s introduced me to so many new hobbies, many of which are active activities. Some team sports, and some individual sports. I’ve started some new sports of my own, and have began to introduce her to them as well. Not only has meeting her changed my life romantically, but I’ve also gotten very close to all of her friends of which she has many. When my leg didn’t work and I lost my job, I was alone almost 24/7. I had very little help with anything from family and friends. It was the darkest time of my life. Now, I feel like it’s one of the most social and happiest times of my life. It’s been a complete 180 from where I was before. 

When my leg got better, I also applied for a federal job. I’d always wanted to work for the federal government, not just for the benefits but also for the job security. It was a very long and stressful process, but just last week I received the email with a firm job offer and I am due to begin working with them next week. 

My life has completely changed. I was in the darkest time of my life, not knowing what was going to happen to me and not knowing if I’d ever be able to walk again, hold a job, etc. I’ve now picked up a handful of new hobbies, I’m exercising and running frequently, I have a new career which I’m beyond ecstatic to begin, and a wonderful girlfriend of which I can see an actual future with. 

Words cannot begin to describe how absolutely ecstatic I am for what my future holds. "
happy,"I just got back from a trip to Idaho for my nieces high school graduation. I had casually kept a good relationship over text with my niece ever since she moved from Southern California to Texas to Idaho in less than a few months. I knew she was going through a lot emotionally and with college coming up it was stressful. I remember how I was at that age (I graduated 2003 and also switched high schools my sr year).

Come graduation day we're in the gymnasium and all the families are still kinda getting seated. I can see all the chairs for the seniors to sit on, I see all the administration on stage and the band in the back playing some songs. Then I see some of her family on her moms side get super excited and I look down to my right to see what the commotion's about. It's a sash that said ""Valedictorian"".

What?! Not only was my niece Valedictorian of her class, she absolutely CRUSHED it. She's already a full year ahead into her college coursework, passed every AP exam she took, played Bass Clarinet through school, did Softball and went to State Championships. She's like a superhuman.

I don't have any kids of my own, but the amount of pride I feel for her is immense. To top it all off she got a full ride to the University of Idaho and she plans on studying Neuroscience (you know, easy stuff). And she's still highly critical of herself and self analyses a ton looking for any way to be better in almost anything she does. The coolest thing I ever did was play video games professionally on a stage - this girl's about to solve complex brain problems as a hobby.

As a reward for all her hard work I made her a promise - a thing I never do because I hate making promises as I hate even the idea of not being able to keep one. I promised her if she graduated with a 4 year degree (not even necessarily in neuroscience, I gave her that leeway) that I'd personally pay for and accompany her on a trip to Japan. And since she's worked so hard in high school she's already got a year head start. I now have 3 years to save up for a Japan trip. Worst Best promise ever."
happy,"I've been playing as a non-singing guitarist
in rock bands for a long time and finally started taking singing lessons 2 months ago to boost my confidence.

My wife has heard me sing plenty at home in private and has always given that supportive, but vague, ""yah, you sound OK"" response.

My instructor said I really had to own and believe in the lyrics of the songs I sing, so l've been working on singing with more feeling and expression.

We've been together for more than 30 years and I'm still crazy about her.

This morning I was hugging my wife, and while looking in her eyes, I started singing her the Beatles version of ""Til There Was You""...and she got quiet with watery eyes and a beet red face!  Then we burst out laughing.

My voice may not be perfect and I may be an old, but maybe I still got it!😻"
happy,"The title says the story , tomorrow is my first day at work ( though it is an internship) and I am so happy that I am finally entering the working life 😁 I just came here cuz I wanted to share it with more people ! "
happy,"I was stopping by to make another donation, and it just made me so happy to see! She looked so happy holding and petting that little plushie, and it felt really good knowing that it went to someone who would love and cherish it far more than I ever did."
happy,"I know nothing big but it still makes me happy as I can go to sleep for today now.
Only 1 more thing to programm tomorrow and I will be more or less done!"
happy,"My mom, who is literally one of the most thoughtful and kindest people I've ever and probably will ever meet, owns a storage place where she keeps all of her things that she sells. Sometimes, if she knows the person and knows they're struggling, she will give them things for super cheap. Like one time she sold someone she knew was struggling two nice brand new thick comforters for 4 dollars. She's very well known in the area for this and sometimes people will come and knock on her door just to give her stuff that they don't want, just because they know she'll take it and do good with it.

I always had a little pink mini frigidaire that I kept some of my beauty products in and I loved it dearly, but a few months back it stopped working. I never made a big deal out of it but my mom knew of it. Well, she kept it in mind apparently when today she came to me and gave me a practically brand new, perfectly working, mini black frigidaire that one of her friends didn't want anymore. Just because.

My mom is always reminding me that I can have anything that I want in her storage, she even insists on it when I tell her that I want to pay her. She will shout at me and say ""No! Take it! I don't want your money!"" I'm really grateful to her because I'm surrounded by really beautiful things (both vintage and non vintage) because she lets me have anything I want. I'll just look at something for two seconds too long and she'll ask ""You like it? You want it??"" It's funny really.

When she gave me the frigidaire I told her just how grateful I was and that I felt really lucky to have a mom like her. She said to me that I reminded her of herself at my age and that she once said the same words to her mom, who also owned a storage full of stuff that she would sell. Her mom (my grandma) was the same way and gave her whatever she wanted for free. It's no wonder I was surrounded by very pretty, sometimes downright luxurious looking things growing up too!

I know it's a bit superficial, it's not the only reason I am grateful to my mom, but it's just how thoughtful it was. It made me really happy. I'm glad to have a teensy fridge again too."
happy,Those birds that everyone used to hear in the morning are coming back. They all migrated about six years ago with no explanation and now they are back
happy,"So, basically I had 1€ in my bank account, a d my best friend transfered the remaining 5 to me, because we wanted to play a game together that was on sale. I'm so grateful and happy. I'm definitely going to pay him back though, because I would feel bad if I didn't. Besides, it's the right thing to do. He just deserves the world. Of course, I told him that he didn't have to since it's just a game i could get dor the regular price next month, but he insisted so much, because he knew how much I liked the game from watching him play it during shareplay.

As someone has asked this before in this thread : I'm not comfortable sharing private information with strangers such as sharing my PayPal info."
happy,"After dealing with both clogged ears since Oct 2022, multiple ER visits, walk-in clinics, doctors, mineral oils, hydrogen peroxide, failed referrals to ENTS, I finally found an ear doctor that was willing to help me. He was able to unclog both my ears!

I can finally hear again. 

Nature, music, sounds I never heard before are all overwhelming. It’s like having surround sound!

Grateful for the small things. I am happy not to ask people to repeat themselves anymore!"

happy,"I’m going with 2 of my close girl friends. I’ve done cruises with family before but I’ve never traveled as an adult, both in the US and internationally,  without family (parents) or husband. Now I’m 31, divorced, just got out of an awful relationship, and i am SO excited for these next adventures. I’m going to see some BEAUTIFUL places, learn fascinating history, drink, laugh, meet new people, and I can hardly wait. 

I’ve been through a pretty wild ride the last several years and I just feel like I am in a really good place. I have good friends, good family, a job I love that pays the bills, and I am able to do things like get a Disneyland pass and travel to new places. I am so happy and grateful to be where I am in life and I hope everyone finds this level of contentment ❤️"
happy,She's asleep right now next to me. My phone took a poop so she said that I could use hers so I thought I'd make a post like this. You don't have to upvote I'm just posting it just for the sake of her finding it one day. 
happy,"How old were you when you passed your road test? I am 20 years old and about to turn 21 next month, and I passed just yesterday morning! I have my driver’s license! 🚗🎉😄"
happy,"This morning I was going to work and it was dark but I saw my bf pass me on the highway on our way to work, I instantly got butterflies. Then when I got to the Dunkin drive thru who do I see in front of me….. it’s him. Lol I didn’t think he would notice but then when I got to the window to pay for my coffee the cashier said “here you go. The gentleman in front of you already paid” it’s the little things. y’all I’m so in love 🥰 "
happy,"and also wanted to ask the you, the users of internet if I am the only one who thinks that she looks like soe kind of a fairy."
happy,Let’s go weekend !!
happy,Mum has been helping me orchestrate so she knows I'm coming back- I haven't seen my family since Christmas and I've especially missed my little sister so I decided instead of staying at uni for reading week I'm gonna go home and surprise her!
happy,I think I'm off to good start today
happy,"I’m a friendly person so I know or recognize a lot of folks in person, but I am dogshit at recalling names. 

She said hello to me first and I said, “hey (redacted)!” and we had a nice chat about living here. Sounds like the last person to live in my place was really neat, so I have some cool shoes to fill! 

Hooray for small steps in self improvement and mundane conversations!"
happy,"I'm 33 weeks pregnant and my husband's bday is Monday. Money is tight and I couldn't take the day off work so this weekend I've been working really hard to make it special. Yesterday made him breakfast, homemade angel food cake (with fresh strawberry toppings), and we went to his cousins for an epic hot pot dinner. Today is his 'lazy' day where he wasn't supposed to do anything but relax. This morning I made breakfast again, cleaned the kitchen, and did laundry. I was super exhausted and laid down to watch a movie. Shortly after my husband comes in with this! The plate was full, but I was so hungry I started eating before I took a picture. My hormones are crazy right now but I'm just so happy! I even cried a little."
happy,It's Spring! I am so happy when I hear the birds and frogs on my walk to work.
happy,"These past few days, my boyfriend and I have been spending a lot of time on calls, sharing what our everyday lives look like. Since then, I have learned a lot about him: he hates when people eat messy stuff in his car, he likes a slightly messy room but not too much, and he really thinks it's important to have a cup holder when you're drinking in bed. But most importantly, when he sleeps, he snores a little bit. It's the cutest thing I've ever heard in my whole life. Maybe I'm just so in love, but hearing him sleep like that, with his little sounds, makes my heart so fuzzy. I love every little thing about him, every little quirk."
happy,I just feel so much better now that I've learned to cope with all of my mental health issues and even though is not perfect I just feel so proud of myself :))
happy,"after dealing with anxiety my whole life and suffering a lot of traumatic events, i finally got the help i needed (prozac/fluoxetine) !!

i finally feel happy and less anxious, im arguing with my dad less and things are looking up ! yay !!!! 😁 life is good and it DOES in fact get better"
happy,"Might not seem like a big accomplishment to a lot of people, but as someone who’s been constantly biting their nails until they bleed since like 6 years old (I’m now 16), this is a big accomplishment for me!! 

I used to bite them a lot when I was nervous, after panic attacks or after breakdowns, but for the last two weeks I haven’t had any urges to! My nails are finally long enough that I can paint them and they’re also the longest they’ve been in years! 

They might not be super long but to me they are! I’m hoping to let them grow longer and learn to do more nail art and stuff with them!"
happy," I got both a new laptop, and a PS5! I came into some money recently so I decided to treat myself. I needed a new laptop for school I just started at a university, and a PS5 so I can play the new Spiderman game! I have wanted a PS5 for nearly 3 years now, and it is finally mine. I also bought my textbooks for school as well. I still have a lot of money, but I will not go overboard. I will spend only what I need. I can buy lunch this week at school, and fix my bike but thats it. I need to open a savings account online and I will just put a bunch of it in there. "
happy,I'm a passionate and disabled bilingual preschool teacher with a resilient spirit. Overcame adversity after losing my left hand in an accident at age 12. I have finally launched my first children's book on Kickstarter. I'm quite excited.
happy,"The dress was 2 sizes smaller than her body shape, and then, today was the day, pure happiness in her face, I'm so happy and proud of her 🥹❤️"
happy,"See the before and after, but this fireplace hadn't been touched in years and was not being used

I ripped out the old tile, poured a new base, pressure washed the fireplace, painted the cast iron, used lemon juice to clean the barss exterior, and retiled the entire thing

Thank God for YouTube"
happy,"I'm 32, been struggling with depression and anxiety since I was about 13 or 14. Due to reasons, I never tried medication for either, before (even when I definitely should have). Basically, I was conditioned to think that my illnesses were not real and medication was just not an option. 

About a year and a half ago, I started meds for my depression, and they certainly help, but I've still been struggling with overwhelming, constant anxiety that has been truly ruining my life. I *finally* talked to my doctor about it, and she prescribed an additional medication. Within only 5 days, I have noticed a HUGE, incredible improvement. I feel like me, again. I can breathe again (literally, I've have constricted breathing for like a year). 

I want to cry, I'm so relieved and happy to feel like I have my life back, again. I wish I had done this years ago, but I've got it now and that's all that matters!"
happy,"I moved into a small flat when I had my first child, we've lived here for a long time and grown our family and made do with what we had. The area we are in isn't the nicest but we always made the best of it. I started looking for something bigger for us 5 years ago. 
2 years ago we were broken into, (nothing taken, it was a drug addict looking for someone, but refused to believe they didn't live in our house), that same year a new neighbor moved in who vandalised cars on the street, picked fights with passers by, started giving sweets to children in their gardens when the parents weren't looking and he eventually broke into a girl nearbys home. (He didn't harm her just scared her and left)
Last week, I got a call that there is a house available via council housing and I can finally have something more affordable, safer and bigger for my children. When I showed my daughter the keys the first thing she asked was 'is it somewhere safe?' And I can finally say yes. I feel more at peace than I have done in years."
happy,"ive been on a lot of social apps (twitter, instagram, discord) but this is my first time really using reddit. like i would go to reddit before just for random advice (bc who doesnt trust random people on the internet) but no one told me reddit was a place i could just yap about anything but actually initiate good conversation with people that care about the same topic. best app ever "
happy,"My birthday was the 27th and I received money for letting me buy supplies to try sculpting for the first time. I went to Micheal’s and got everything I needed! The wonderful cashier gave me a discount and I was able to add a few more things I’d been eyeing! 

I drew ideas for figurines ages ago and I finally get to turn one of them into a reality!! This is my progress so far! I’ve never sculpted clay before but I have done some models on ZBrush and watched a few tutorials on working the clay, so I had an idea of how things were going to go. I’m doing piece by piece and then putting them all together at the end. I plan to paint and varnish it as well!! 

I’ve had a lot of fun so far and I’m really excited to finish it!!"
happy,"It looks like no big thing, normal achievements for most people, but 2 years ago I was depressed, no job, no money, no friends, single, my mental health wasn't good at all. Now I'm working, I have a job, I met a girl that I really like, she became my girlfriend, and I started to work out, I've gained a few pounds, my physique looks better now.

I'm really proud of myself and feeling happy. I felt like sharing it because depressed people can change their life for the better, it's not easy but it's possible!"
happy,"Since the beginning of the month. I've started strength training and running. Now at the end of the month I can do 40 sit ups, 40 push ups, can jog a quarter mile, I can now lift heavier weight. And I've dropped 5 pounds. "
happy,"And I rigged it up to open with a fake book. This is something I've always, always wanted, and it makes me ridiculously happy to have finished the project. Downstairs is my game room, with old consoles, my gaming PC, and tons of nerd stuff like Lego sets and Star Wars and Star Trek paraphernalia."
happy,"Basically the title but my mum recently bought us tickets to see Hozier when he comes to Australia and she’s now teaching herself the lyrics to all his songs so she can sing along, what makes this better is that English is not her first language and she keeps asking me what some words mean so she can fully understand what his songs are about."
happy,"Grew up in a small poor town in rural midwest. First of my family to go to college. I did two years of community college first while working at the mall and lived with parents, then I transferred to University and I only needed a loan for my final semester. That was in 2012. Not gonna lie, I was pretty much couch surfing/homeless til 2014 where I decided to learn programming (my major in college was history, what a waste of time).

Got my big break in 2015, but still living on the edge and needed roommates until 2019. In 2022 I joined a tech startup which I am still working at. I have zero debt outside of a mortgage (got a house at 3% in 2022 whew!), and have savings of a bit over $500k thanks to some smart investing. I got married in 2019 and have a daughter, and life is pretty good as I get to work from home and my wife doesn't have to work. My hours are flexible at work as well as long as I get my tasks done, that's all they care about. No set hours.

After expenses we have about $3k left over every month to invest or do something fun with.

I am pretty happy. Hopefully it lasts."

happy,"I just wanted to share to everyone that I am truly happy. The past couple of weeks, I have spent my afternoons and nights outside on my back porch just enjoying life. Sometimes I will watch my phone, or I’ll browse Reddit, but just being outside in the bliss, cool, and calming air just makes me feel some kind of way. Pair that with the beautiful sounds of the birds, and the frogs in the distance. It all just puts me at ease. Most of my life has been pretty stressful, especially now that I’m graduating high school in less than a month. To be able to enjoy the creations of God with the moon shining, the chirps of the birds in the trees, the speckled sky littered with stars, and the gentle sway of the pine trees… I’ve rambled. Point is guys, I truly feel happy. I have nothing to complain about. I have great friends, great parents, a cute little chihuahua, supporting teachers and staff at my school, and most importantly what seems to be a great future. No idea what I’ve done to deserve it all but I’m grateful. Just wanted to share my emotions because seeing life at face value, excluding all negatives, is so special to me. "
happy,"In my 30’s, yesterday on my second attempt, I passed my driving test. It still feels like a fever dream and still can’t believe it actually happened but I did it. 

I never thought I would get behind the wheel of a car. Fear and anxiety being a factor but something has always gotten in the way any time I thought about it over the years.

I am so proud of myself for doing something entirely outside of my comfort zone and gaining new independence. 

Happy is an understatement."
happy,"my online friend from a different country visited for her birthday and invited me to disneyland! i have never gone before in my life! i was really taken aback by her offer too. she bought my ticket, for her bday celebration trip? 😭😭😭

she made it possible that me and my partner could actually afford to go and meet her there. 🥺🥺🥺

i brought her a gift related to her one of her special interest, it was something she said she wanted too, so it was perfect and she was so happy. she also gifted me a plush, which is my special interest! i will cherish this plush forever. 

my partner and i spent the whole day with her and it was amazing. i have no irl friends, only online as it is what i prefer. i find like-minded individuals with the same interests! we are also both diagnosed with ASD, and we really clicked as friends in real life as we do online! ☺️ it was just the same! 

she is going back to her home country tomorrow and that’s bittersweet, but the memories we made today were priceless!

this is the first online friend i’ve ever met in person before too. she is such a sweet friend! my partner really enjoyed hanging out with her too! 

had to gush about my day, as it’s the best i’ve had in a very long time. maybe ever."
happy,"So, this was my first year applying to physical therapy school and I managed to get accepted everywhere I applied. I even have a soft offer for a paid research assistant position for work similar to what I did in undergrad!

I understand that PT school isn't the best financial decision for most people, but I did accept my offer at a relatively cheap school. Beyond that, I grew up with a single mom and my first paycheck will be more than she has ever made! It just feels like all the work is paying off and I am making progress towards my goals."
happy,"As an artist, I’ve never been as prolific as I have been this year and even though I beat myself up about it, it’s amazing to think back on the year about ALL the paintings I have done. I’ve probably done over twenty or thirty paintings this year of varying sizes and this was after YEARS of doing maybe just less than a handful. I think last year I did two or three. Prior to this year I was making friends who didn’t even know I was a painter or went to school for art. I’m proud to say that narrative has vastly shifted! I’m so proud of myself for painting more even though it’s really hard to get started some days."
happy,"It took a lot of saving, moving things around financially, and sacrificing. I’m looking to improve my finances (and my life) in the future, but it’s good to have hope for once. Really was worried I’d miss the deadline. 

Sorry, I known I’ve been a problem , and I have no one who really cares enough in my life to share this with. Thank you guys for allowing me."
happy,"I have the best in-laws, they spoil me more than their own son! I volunteer at a pig sanctuary, so when my MIL saw this she said she just had to get it for me. I’m so lucky 🥰"
happy,My birthday is in 2 days! (6th april). Felt like 'treating' myself for once again [been extremely stressed so i kind of forgot about the whole self-love/worth/whatever-thing hahaha] and just thought if im already turning 16 i might aswell get myself the books i've been wanting for so long😊🩷
happy,"After being rejected for an early admission, and direct admission, I still tried to appeal for a third time to get into the college course I wanted. I just got the results that I was SUCCESSFUL!!!!!! I'M SO HAPPY I'M CRYING I MADE IT I MADE IT. I had absolutely no hope for if i didn't get accepted and was considering giving up entirely"
happy,"Got paid for my voice acting today!!!!

I AM SO HAPPY!!! I got paid for doing voice acting work—my very first paid VA work of the year! It wasn’t much but it makes me very happy! Makes me feel like I’m doing something right!! I only said a few lines, haha!! BUT STILL!!!!!"
happy,"Hello everyone! If you look on my profile I’ve posted once a year about my weight loss. I started originally at 320 (although I was too embarrassed to admit it) and got to I think 250 before I got hurt, gained more weight, lost some. Now for 2023. Over the end of 2022 and into 2023 I let a coworker treat me to lunch every day. Where I ate a ton and really fell back into my old terrible habits and all that.
Since September something in me changed. (Also me and that coworker stopped talking, they were a terrible influence but I’m not go into that here) I have cut out most sugars and in general crappy food out. I usually eat one good meal a day. 
I originally started this just to lose weight out of embarrassment of how bad I had let myself go. Now, I just want to feel better. I’ve seen how much my diet change has improved how I feel and the lost weight helps a ton too. I feel so much better about myself. I just want to change now for the betterment of my health, now for how I look.
So here’s my post this year to keep myself accountable (and also people have said they wanted to see my updates as the years go on)
My end goal right now for this year is to be near 220, but I’d REALLY like to be under 200. So let’s see how 2024 will treat me and you and I hope we can accomplish our goals. If you made it this far reading, I thank you! See you next year!"
happy,"I recently met someone. Our first date was during the work week, we met for drinks and ended up talking for 6 hours! Our second date was yesterday. It was so nice. We had ice cream and  went to the museum. He’s smart and funny. Artistic and creative. We had great conversation and he was a complete gentleman. He texted today and asked to go on a proper dinner date. 
I’m looking forward to seeing where this could go. ☺️ "

happy,"

I guess I'm just trying to put some good vibes for myself out on a night where I feel rather low. I honestly didn't think I could get this far but since February I've lost 32lbs according to my scale this morning. It's probably more once I poop...if I poop."
happy,"Hi guys, 

So I’ve been doing some meditations that have really been working for me lately and I have a few things in my life that are going well and am in a couple blessed situations. I’m starting to have moment of real happiness on levels I don’t know if I’ve had before. I think mostly due to the meditations because it’s not externally dependent. 

I still have daily struggles and things I’m working on. A lot more than people know. Even the fact that I’m working on my struggles and am seeing them getting better is making me happy. I’ve had a lot of suffering in my life, especially within myself about myself and to witness imrovement is like witnessing a wonder, a miracle. 

I keep running into the situation where I tell people about the good things in my life, in a super excited way, (it could even be a new positive way I’m perceiving the world), and I feel (or at least perceive (I could be projecting)) it making people uncomfortable or I feel that I am being too much. I notice within me a fear of being unrelatable expressing the goodness in my life. I’m afraid of making people jealous. I feel like I need to then tone down the positive thing I said with something more “down to earth” (though I don’t because I see that urge rising from an anxiety about how others perceive me and to not try to “fix” it) 

I feel like I need to be more tactful than I am and I’m curious if anyone has any advice? One thing I’m trying not to do is tone myself down for others comfort (I’ve often done this when going out to not make other girls jealous) but also I don’t want to come off as chaotic or make people feel bad. 

On some level writing this does make me feel like it’s okay to be unapologetically happy/well. Maybe that’s how relaxed people are and I’m just learning/relearning it. 

Grateful for your input.
Thank you . "
happy,Today is day 1 of no contact after being married to a narcissist for 8 years this is the hardest thing I have ever done in my life I’ve lived through the abuse the torture the cheating the lies and yet I miss them but today I started making a list every time I want to call them I add to that list a reminder of all the things my brain made me forget all these years I am hoping this is day 1 of a life without being controlled 
happy,"Quit my job

Recently quit my full time job. Was a good position and good pay but my manager went behind my back and basically just gave my position away and expected me to take the demotion purely because she was struggling at the other location and needed me back there to help. It was nothing to do with me or my work as I was really good at my job (don't mean to be bigheaded) but she allowed this other lady to introduce herself to all my colleagues as the manager of my location when they all know that i was there. 
I was really upset because it made it look like it was because I couldn't do my job and she completely broke any trust I had for her. I loved my job and I'm pretty upset BUT I stood up for myself and didn't stand for the lack of respect and told her where to go. I'm proud of myself for doing so and happy I'm no longer working under her. I'm confident I'll get a good job again that gives me the respect and decency I'm owed.

Just needed a lil rant lol don't mind me"
happy,"Ill try to be short and sweet, but basically I mentioned to my boyfriend, close friend of two years boyfriend for almost one year, that I'd really love a prom-posal for our senior year since I've never experienced one and it's a once in a lifetime kinda thing for us.

It was a while ago and I assumed her forgot because his schedule with school, sports, gym, etc has him running around. I wasn't even upset and chose to keep it to myself since I know his life is already hectic and didn't want to feel like I was pressuring him.

Well today we were in my room relaxing, I bought some small Lego sets to do, before we started building them he told me if I wanted to see a card trick he just learned.

He dabbles in card tricks and magic, when we first met he did a lot of magic for me, I love watching these tricks to this day. He sat me down next to him and started going on about Royal flush being the best hand in poker while doing the trick for me. I was confused but going along with it and before I knew it he said ""You know what else would be the best, you going to prom with me"" and in front of me the royal flush hand with heart cards with will you go to prom with me on the cards.

I'm heavily emotional and started bawling my eyes like a baby cause he caught me off guard and I didn't know what to say but he reminded me I had to say Yes while hugging me lol.

Regardless, I'm still tearing up over it still cause I can't believe how great of a guy he is and I adore every nerdy, geeky ounce of him.

I just wanted to share this because even though I know it's probably some silly high school romance I still feel like the luckiest person in the world.

Hope you're all having a good day or night and I wish the best for all of you who took time to read this sappy stuff :)"

happy,"I'm a 30yr old woman and I've never really played with Legos before. My husband is an avid Lego lover, both as a kid and as an adult, and has recently wanted to get back into building them. 

I know there have been some really cool sets to come out in the past couple of years (some look like flowers or little zen gardens or insects one might pin, etc) so when he got himself a set today I also looked. I found this darling little bonsai tree and he offered to get it for me so we could build together! 

We both put ours together tonight and it was so much fun! I didn't realize that the cherry blossoms were actually little pink frogs until I got to that section. My little bonsai is chilling with its adorable little pink frogs on my counter and I could not be more pleased!

And for anyone wondering, hubby got himself the Thanos glove and he is pleased as punch! 😊"
happy,"We found out she had uterine cancer last week, and they scheduled her for a hysterectomy immediately. She had surgery this morning, and it went great. Minimum blood loss, no sign of cancer. I'm so relieved I can't even tell you. Best day of my life."
happy,"Around November of last year I (26F) matched with this guy(26M), he's honestly one of the sweetest guys I've met on a dating app. We were talking for a whole, but had to go out seprate ways, because he was unemployed then and looking for a job and had other things going on in his life. He felt like he couldn't give me time. Which was totally ok and understable. 

Anyway in one of our conversation where he was stressed about not getting a job, I remember giving him a pep talk, and he told me then that when he gets a job I'll be one of the first few people he'll tell. 

It's been around two months since we stopped talking and he texted me today that he got a hired! I'm also suprised that he remembered and texted me about his job. I'm so happy for him. In suprising turn off events in currently unemployed after leaving a toxic workspace and seeing him get a job, made me feel not so bad about my own unemployment. So to whoever is in the same boat. We got this! We'll get a good job that will make us happy."
happy,"I'm an artist in NYC and the last several months have been brutally slow. After a lot of exhausting work, and serious anxiety about what they would say, not 1 but both people who reached out to me said they were going through with their purchases!!! I am soooooo happy and relieved!!! I'll be taking myself out to dinner tomorrow to celebrate 🥳 🎉  The first painting was called ""A Summer Daydream"" and the second was ""Health, Wealth, Prosperity."" Both acrylic on canvas and lots of love! Cheers to a great new year!! ✨️🥰✨️"

happy,"Got my dog a toy today at a local ranch supply store. This was supposed to be the be all end all toy for destructive dogs. She managed to tear chunks out of it in 5 minutes flat. I wrote the company and said nice try, but it just didn't hold up. Company wrote back and said that only about 5% of dogs globally could defeat their rubber toys. As my puppy was one of those 5%, would I allow her to become a tester for their company? Heck yes, I'll let her do that. Whether they pay me, or whether they just send free toys, it's still a win for me and my American Bully XL.

ETA, this was an off brand toy, not the well known super duty one."
happy,I’m so happy to see how far he has come and to watch him get healthy!
happy,"NSFW for mention of suicide 

This time last year I was lower than I've been. I remember having to pull my car over because I was crying so hard I couldn't see. I remember sitting with my loaded gun and the only thing that stopped me is kids often go to the park I was in. I remember trying to wreck into a semi after a particularly bad day. For years I was so depressed and so low I never imagined things could be this good. 

But now I wake up everyday overjoyed. I go to work and even though it's work I love it. I shower and I don't sit and cry. I ride with my windows down and sing along to my music and thank my God that I'm alive to see today. That I didn't opt out before I turned 18 like I thought I would. That I made it to 22 like I didn't believe I could. That I wake up today at 25 happier than I've ever been my entire life. I smile and I laugh and I love and I took control of what made my life so awful and kicked its ass until I had full control. 

I think back on all those years I spent unhappy and hating myself and harming myself and I wish I could talk to old me and tell her that it does get better. It takes a long time and alot of shit but you come out on top. 

25 is so young and my life is so full now and I just wanted someone to know. I'm just happy and that's all I've ever wanted and all I'll ever want. I'm just happy to be happy yall"
happy,"I’m a 20 year old in my last year of college and for a long time I was so confused as to what I wanted to do with my communications degree. I did a few internships which I hated and had no idea how I was going to cope working in a place I hate for the next 50 years. 

Now, by a chance opportunity, I started a new job alongside my studies for a company in an industry that I love to death (it’s a type of sports). 

I love the people I work with, my office is super nice, and the work is really interesting and fulfilling. I’m actually genuinely excited to grow and learn and forge my career and I am so grateful for the opportunity!

happy,"I'm a few states away from home for a conference this week, and during some downtime I looked up things to do nearby. Turns out the art museum a short walk away had my FAVORITE sculpture on display, I didn't even know it had been put into a collection! 

L' Amante by Beth Cavener is every bit as beautiful in real life as I could have imagined and I am SO excited to have been able to marvel at it with my own two eyes!"
happy,"We (24F) and (22M) met on an app called Yocket, which is popular in India for graduate abroad studies. One day, she texted in the group about the decision deadline for a particular university. I saw the message and made a joke, which made her laugh. Intrigued, I wanted to learn more about her, so I checked out her profile. It turned out she had applied and got an admit from the same university where I had applied.

I decided to direct message her, asking about her application process and the decision. What started as professional college talk gradually turned into more personal conversations about our day-to-day activities and common interests. It all began on March 19th, 2023. Her age-related freakouts, even when we were just friends, were adorable.

By July, we found ourselves flirting without even fully knowing that we were “flirting”. We gave each other nicknames—I call her Goldie, and she calls me Twee. The nicknames stemmed from a funny story; she forgot few things, so I jokingly called her Goldfish (with its 15-second memory), which eventually led to Goldie. Twee came from star > twinkle > twee; she called me Starfish (with no brain) after I said something silly.

As I was about to fly to the USA for my higher studies on August 8th and yeah she couldn’t make it this year cause of some personal reasons, she sent me a long, heartfelt text when I was at the airport. It made me realize I was leaving something behind in India, even though my dream was to live in the USA. The text stirred emotions in me that I had never felt before.In the USA, I struggled to express my feelings or ask her out, but on August 13th, I finally did it, and she said, ""Fuck yes."" Despite not meeting or speaking on calls, we texted for hours every day. However, we knew long-distance wouldn't work without meeting in person, so I decided to visit her after my first semester, which was six months away. We didn't meet before I flew to the USA because I'm from a city that's 350 kilometers away from hers, and we also didn't acknowledge our feelings while I was living in India. We regretted that after August too much, and it was hilarious.

After a month, we started doing calls and decided to meet in person, skipping video calls and only sharing pictures. Although we knew we were in love, we didn't say it outright; instead, we used phrases like ""I purple you"" and ""I l you."" Purple became our color because One day, while I was assisting her with the application process, she thanked me with a purple heart instead of a red one. Later, she revealed that she didn't want to give the ""wrong impression"" by sending red hearts lol. From that moment on, purple became our color in everything, from hearts to flowers and to act more goofy, like Avengers' ""I love you 3000,"" we chose 2468 as our special number.

In January, I flew to India, and on the 6th, we finally met. It was nerve-wracking as she sat at Cubbon Park in Bangalore, facing away from the entrance which was extremely adorable. When I tapped her shoulder, she turned and we hugged for solid two minutes which was the best moment of my life. I spent the entire January with her, When we began our personal conversations, we discovered a shared love for a special dessert: blueberry cheesecake. We always dreamt of sharing it in person, so after 6-7 months of anticipation, we finally had our first cheesecake date in January. We also exchanged bouquets of purple flowers and now that I've flown back to the US, I miss my baby Gold so much. I just wanna be with her all the time. I love her 2468."
happy,"These little monsters just got some character for me each one a bit different yet some how they are all the samen monsters.

It’s fun to create and expand. 

What is your take."
happy,Met my bestfriends girlfriend and when we were alone for a little bit she told me “he talks about you all the time and it’s really obvious you mean so much to him and he looks up to you. i’m really glad he has you he needs you”. It just felt so damn good man. Usually it’s people talking bad behind your back but he is praising me to his GIRLFRIEND. I feel so loved man.
happy,"I start my first job tomorrow!

I’m a new grad nurse currently in the Philippines, and after passing the board exam, I contacted my review center and expressed my interest in lecturing to help teach others how to pass their licensure exam.

I’m starting tomorrow and it feels like a dream came true that I didn’t even know I had. I love helping people, it’s part of why I got into nursing in the first place, and the knowledge that I can have even a small part in helping others getting to that point makes me truly happy.

The company is very easy to communicate with, I respect the hell out of my seniors, I’ll travel around the country to lecture at the other centers, and I’ll be able to use this opportunity to also help prepare myself for eventually taking the US NCLEX as well.

This year hasn’t started out great, but this is a giant W to get my mood up, and I am so greatful for the opportunity and experience."
happy,"My mum has always been big into sewing and is much better at it than I am, I lost my quilt when I was 19 and we had a flood and it broke my heart because I was planning on passing it onto my daughter. But out of the blue this arrived. My daughter loves it and it's an absolutely gorgeous quilt. It looks like it took an insane amount of time (from all the different patches, edging and lining I'd estimate about 30 hours) and it's got a whole story that my mum wrote out by hand. The nostalgia, happiness at seeing my daughters joy and appreciation for the effort my mum went to for her granddaughter has made me the most proud and happy son/father "
happy,"I'm a 30yr old woman and I've never really played with Legos before. My husband is an avid Lego lover, both as a kid and as an adult, and has recently wanted to get back into building them. 

I know there have been some really cool sets to come out in the past couple of years (some look like flowers or little zen gardens or insects one might pin, etc) so when he got himself a set today I also looked. I found this darling little bonsai tree and he offered to get it for me so we could build together! 

We both put ours together tonight and it was so much fun! I didn't realize that the cherry blossoms were actually little pink frogs until I got to that section. My little bonsai is chilling with its adorable little pink frogs on my counter and I could not be more pleased!

And for anyone wondering, hubby got himself the Thanos glove and he is pleased as punch! 😊"
happy,"Hey all, today I woke up and stepped on a weight scale and saw it was 158.5lbs :) I was around 202lbs when I started and it's amazing I reached into the 150 range, the last recorded weight of me I can remember was being around 160 a couple years back and it has only gone up since then. The fact I'm lower than that makes me extremely proud of myself and that change really is possible! 

It really helps I also have my boyfriend supporting me and he's one of my main motivators, he helps me feel secure and safe :D

There were times I ""failed"" and felt terrible about myself that I didn't keep myself in check, then I always tell myself, ""it's a marathon, not a race"" and that along the way you will have difficulties snacking, plateaus, and others where you just go beyond your calories for the day. But also, times where you'll do it and be succcessful. In the end they all add up and you will see that no matter what, that you DID lose weight because you didn't give up regardless of all the missteps. The smallest steps are my favorite, esp at the beginning! Because something is working. The scale isn't always accurate and fluctuates, so I take pictures and the differenc is very noticable :)

Super proud of myself, and thankful to my boyfriend in this journey."
happy,Just wanted to share pictures from where I started and where I am. I’m so grateful to have friends and family that have helped along the way.
happy,"Being funny and having a sense of humor and quick wit is something that's always mattered to me. Whenever somebody tells me I'm funny or laughs at my jokes it makes me feel really good.

I tend to have kinda shitty self-esteem so being told to my face something like that with any kind of regularity means a lot. It's nice to be secure in something that matters to me."
happy,"There isn’t much that brings me pleasure anymore but i am so grateful for warm blankets. I just put a blanket in the drier until it was warmed up, i took it out and laid under it for a few seconds and it was one of the most pleasurable things I have ever felt in my life. I just felt so safe, so comforted and loved and even though i was completely alone i didn’t feel like it at all. All of the tension in my body just completely went away and breathing became so easy, my lungs felt so open and every time i breathed i could feel my breath traveling throughout my whole body. The pleasurable sensation that started in my chest began to expand, until it expanded to the blanket itself. I didn’t even feel like a separate entity anymore, nothing was separate, all that exists is warmth, and every aspect of my surroundings including myself is a part of the Great Warmness. I was so affectionate i started smiling so intensely and i felt so happy i started crying in the middle of nowhere. It was beautiful. Why is a heated piece of cloth capable of this?? Even though it only lasts a few seconds, it makes everything around me seem perfect and it makes everything seem okay. It’s the only friend i have. I love the warmth of heated blankets so much and i am so thankful for its sweet embrace, i don’t deserve it at all"
happy,"This was filmed at their album release party this past January. I think it rocks and wanted to share. They’re on Spotify and are already ready for a second album this summer. Really happy for him, he’s the guitarist in the cowboy hat and wrote this instrumental!"
happy,"My boyfriend lives on the other side of the world, so we only get to see each other a handful of times each year. I arrived last night after a very long day of driving, flying, and layovers.

This is my second time seeing him in 2024, and we’ll get 2-3 more visits if we’re lucky.

Before I left, I googled concerts in the area, and my favorite band is playing nearby! I found out about the show completely by chance, and I’m so excited!

Currently sitting on his couch, crocheting a blanket for him, and he’ll be home in about 30 minutes (:

So grateful I get to see my favorite band live with my favorite person!!! Happy Thursday everyone"

happy,"I can't believe I know how to play chess now. I always shunned it because I thought it required way too much thinking for it to be any kind of fun game, but now that I know how the pieces move, I feel like I can do a lot more intellectual things. Really, I learned how to play for two reasons: I quit two of my greatest addictions and really needed something new to occupy my mind. The other reason is because someone once asked me if I knew how to play chess, and it came off as them questioning my intelligence, and I didn't like that at all. So, now I finally know how to play and have so much more I can learn, which is great because I have so much time on my hands.

I'm having a blast! I can't believe I never took the time to learn this very great game. I'm so happy!"
happy,"I (20f) grew up with an emotionally abusive mother who neglected me and favoured my two older half brothers. I grew up on tv because I was a socially awkward kid and any friends I did have would want to hang with my brothers instead (we have a 6 and 7 year age gap. So when I was 8 they were teens). I saw that on a lot of my favourite shows there would be at least one picnic episode where the family would go to a park with the classic red and white blanket and eat out of a basket. I always wanted that. I would ask my mom if we could do it with her, my brothers and me ( my parents divorced when I was three and my dad had custody on weekends) but my brothers just wanted to go to the skatepark with their junkie friends. My mom chose them over me every time. So when I was 14 I stopped asking cause I knew that the one day I wanted with my family didn’t matter as much as wasting hours watching my brothers do the same old tricks. 
Anyway I haven’t seen my mother since I was 15 when my dad got full custody of me after my mom disappeared with her boyfriend of the week for a couple days. I have a carer cause I was diagnosed with autism at 13. I asked if we could do a picnic one day with just us fully prepared to be rejected but she said yes. So tomorrow we’re buying a basket and food and sitting on a blanket in the park having a picnic. 

Also mom… Fuck you. "
happy,"So after a few more dates she finally kissed me, she said she didn’t want to fall in love with me I do not know how to take it but she kissed me  all yesterday she even held my hand"
happy,"Title seems conceited, I know, but I have been with fever the past few days and I just forced myself to go out so my brother will have company on the long lines at the cashier.

You see, I like dressing up a lot and I still did it earlier. I tucked a red sweatshirt on a pink skirt and matched it with my pink heels and bag.

At the grocery store, a promoter of something asked me to take a picture with them, and I did! I was genuinely happy about that because someone noticed my style.

We went to another mall because the first store was a bit lacking. While I was looking for food containers to put my desserts in, a saleslady complimented my heels!

I am elated and inspired to go out wearing what I want now! ❤️❤️❤️"
happy,"I'm 32, been struggling with depression and anxiety since I was about 13 or 14. Due to reasons, I never tried medication for either, before (even when I definitely should have). Basically, I was conditioned to think that my illnesses were not real and medication was just not an option. 

About a year and a half ago, I started meds for my depression, and they certainly help, but I've still been struggling with overwhelming, constant anxiety that has been truly ruining my life. I *finally* talked to my doctor about it, and she prescribed an additional medication. Within only 5 days, I have noticed a HUGE, incredible improvement. I feel like me, again. I can breathe again (literally, I've have constricted breathing for like a year). 

I want to cry, I'm so relieved and happy to feel like I have my life back, again. I wish I had done this years ago, but I've got it now and that's all that matters!"
happy,"So happy right now. 

I made some new friends through work. The three of us clicked immediately on the first day. 

Tonight, we went to dinner at my favorite restaurant (Korean BBQ). We ate so much great food and drank so much delicious soju lol

I dont remember the last time I laughed so hard. My cheeks were flushed and I smiled the entire drive home. 

Feeling so grateful for the good people in my life 🥰☺️"
happy,"The big life changes:

1.) pray to God
2.) taking my meds as prescribed 
3.) cutting weed and alcohol out of my life 
"
happy,"
He is the strongest man I have ever met, I admire and look up to him more than he knows. We passed our one year recently and my love for him still grows day by day. The world seems so colorful with meaning falling out of every single fold and crevice. Everything has meaning. Every little bug exists at the same time as we do. As incoherent as it is, I even find joy in realizing we both have eyes to look at the same things together. We are under the same sky. Somehow these axioms of the human experience feel much more meaningful because he’s alive with me. If I had killed myself when I was 17 I would have never known he was out there in this very world that I am in. Living his little 17 year old life, experiencing things that would make him the man he is today. I sometimes wish we would have met as babies. I would’ve loved him when we were 10, 15, 20, just as much as I love him at 24. I think that’s what love is.
"
happy,"Howdy! 

I'm so appreciative of all of y'all's support! I was worried if I was overstaying my welcome on this sub, but y'all were so supportive! For anyone starting their fitness journey from my posts, or anyone who is in their own fitness journey, I'm so proud of you! I'd like to address a couple thing so constantly see in the replies. I'd rather address it on the post instead of individual comments. 

I do infact know I need a calorie deficit to lost consistent weight, and I've been on a calorie deficit since day 2

No, this is not a karma farm. Anyone who values karma so much they lie and take advantage of peoples kindness is an idiot. If you still believe this is a karma farm, that's fine but please don't be rude to or others who just want to improve their lives.

Yes, I know I'm fat, I know I'm unhealthy, you don't need to constantly spam in in the replies. Please come up with more insults because I'm running out of jokes. 

Sorry for the long post but I hope y'all have a great day, Cheers!"
happy,i look good and i feel good - hiking five miles every morning has been glorious and the views here are chefs kiss! just wanted to share that little slice of sunshine. :)
happy,I (F18) talked to the army three months ago about joining just for the fun of it. I had no idea that I could get trained as an LPN. (I want to be a doctor one day so this will get me started in building my career) I signed my contract at MEPs yesterday. I'm really excited to be able to go to college and be able to move out of my parent's house!! 
happy,"I know I know; every community has it's toxic weeds that grow.

But so far my experience on Reddit has been like a walk in the park, and I'm just happy to read so many well written, sad, happy, funny, thought provoking, and interesting  posts/stories!

I always heard Reddit getting made fun of for the most part (and for good reason at times well deserved ofc) and even heavily bashed or told it was a ""cesspool of nasty to absolutely stay away from"".

 I stayed away for a long time, like the plague indeed, but I thought, ""Why not personally give it a shot,"" and see what happens, eh?

Never been a big social media person anyway since I'm not the best at being social, writing, taking pics, or navigating around strangers, so I'm beyond impressed so far with the community and am just happy my experience thus far has been good. :) 

And I'm just giddy to see what great, terrible, hilarious, irksome, and strange posts are yet to come.
Not to be sappy, I'm just happy to enjoy something new and am trying to find happy things to experience, especially with how lucky I am to be alive now.

Simple pleasures are my go to and I'm just getting older and more years are silently passing by. 
And I'm learning how to be a better writer thanks to y'all! I haven't written since high school, and am falling in love all over again with this hobby. 

I haven't seen such good writing, interesting stories, or funny jokes in ages. Impressed and can't wait to be more impressed and, somehow, even let down someday 😅if that even is something to look forward to."
happy,"I spent eight years in an incredibly abusive relationship. Emotionally, mentally, and physically. I was devalued every step of the way and never realized that there were people taking advantage of me. But about two years ago I found people who actually love and care about me, realized my family loves me and that I was being lied to that they didn't. The people who used me did and still will claim I'm a failure, but they wouldn't be where they are without me. But more importantly, I've now surrounded myself with smart, empathetic, kind, successful people and my heart is full of happiness and love now because of it. I have a wonderful relationship, a successful career, and so much to look forward to. I'm so lucky to have what I have now. I'm so happy that I left and can now be a better person for it. I have so much hope for the future that I could never have had before, and I look forward to all of the happiness and success waiting for me now that I've moved on to better things."
happy,That’s all. I’m a 53-year-old woman and I melted right then and there.
happy,Started the year making better changes. Ive lost 19lbs in total since January.
happy,"An undergraduate student I have mentored for the past two-ish years applied to graduate school for the Fall 2024 admissions cycle. I helped them a lot with their applications and talked through deciding where to apply, etc. I've been getting periodic texts from them over the last few weeks as they've received their admissions (and one rejection so far) and it's been such an honor to share in their excitement. They even said I'm one of the first people they want to tell and that just put me over the moon.

Today they got an acceptance into a BIG school and one that was sort of a ""shoot for the stars"" application and I just shrieked and hollered when I got their message. Tears are streaming down my cheeks, but they are happy happy tears. What a privilege to be able to experience this joy with them. Truly an honor. I'm so lucky."
happy,"Even tho it’s quite embarrassing I wanted to share this. This is Caesar my poodle puppy who is ready to greet me early every morning. This means I have to get up and out to walk him first thing, something that I COULD NOT and WOULD NOT ever do before I had him because of my agoraphobia. He has given me more independence and has made me progress so much faster. He even helps with my panic attacks. But most importantly I love him and he makes me happy!"
happy,"I applied at a movie theater the other day, and went there to interview earlier. I had a really cool conversation with one of the managers about working there. Sidebar but I love movies and always talk about them!! I left with confidence thinking I WILL get the job. Lo and behold about two hours after I left that manager called me back and offered me the job! I am so excited to finally work at a movie theater! Like I said I LOVE movies and talking about them so this is like the perfect job for me! I cannot wait to start working for them!"
happy,"Even in the middle of the storm, there are small places to breath"
happy,Soooo satisfying
happy,"We had our ups and downs throughout the year, but we secured our place in the roll-off for the League Championship. Started off strong and finished strong beating last year’s chanpions. "
happy,"I’m going with 2 of my close girl friends. I’ve done cruises with family before but I’ve never traveled as an adult, both in the US and internationally,  without family (parents) or husband. Now I’m 31, divorced, just got out of an awful relationship, and i am SO excited for these next adventures. I’m going to see some BEAUTIFUL places, learn fascinating history, drink, laugh, meet new people, and I can hardly wait. 

I’ve been through a pretty wild ride the last several years and I just feel like I am in a really good place. I have good friends, good family, a job I love that pays the bills, and I am able to do things like get a Disneyland pass and travel to new places. I am so happy and grateful to be where I am in life and I hope everyone finds this level of contentment ❤️"
happy,"This is very small, but I haven't stopped thinking about it since it happened and it makes me happy! Sorry, this might get long.

I have a weird role at my job and it was created when I was hired so there were no processes or procedures in place. It's listed as a Customer Experience Specialist role, but I am involved in every aspect of the company. One thing that's evolved, that definitely wasn't part of the job, is that coworkers confide in me knowing I have a ""loose lips sink ships"" mentality. I never reveal details or gossip, but if I'm concerned about something/someone I'll roundabout bring it up to management. 

On Friday one of my direct teammates was venting pretty hard and I went to my manager to say I was concerned this person may be experiencing burnout and I'm not sure how long they'll be with the company.  My boss said he noticed it too and if they need to leave for their mental wellbeing it's understandable and there are contingency plans in place. Then he said, all except you, there's no contingency plan if we lose you. 

Folks, I know everyone is replaceable, but this made me feel so valued and seen. I already love my job, but this was icing on the cake. 

Thank you for reading. "
happy,"I (19M) turned 19 on Tuesday last week and my girlfriend (19F) made it so special for me. She bought me a huge bunch of flowers and I legit cried so hard in her arms. Ive never been given flowers before and it meant so so much to me. For anyone reading this, buy someone you care about a bunch of flowers it will make their entire year!!!!"
happy,"Growing up I was very thin, but in 2020 I got diagnosed with PCOS I went from 64kgs to 87 kgs over night making all my clothes tight and impossible to wear. I developed and still have body dysmorphia. 
I would always have to buy multiple shein clothes to find something that would fit me. 
Yes plus size exists but I’m one size too small for plus size and one size too big for XL.

Yesterday I went to a shop and found 3 dresses in the style I love 
Which fit me perfectly and had every colour and pattern I wanted I bought 3. But I might god back and get some more. 

I might not be so exciting for others but for me, it made me feel so beautiful and accepted and just happy. "
happy,"So I just impulsively bought train tickets to visit my boyfriend tomorrow! I had a few off days in work but the plane ticket was too expensive, so instead I bought the train tickets which will take around 10 hours to his city, nevertheless I bought it and by the time he’ll be finished with his job, he will see me waiting in front of his office which he has no idea about ! I can’t sleep thinking I’ll get to see him tomorrow and what kind of reaction he’ll be having ! Just today he was complaining that I came for only 4 days previous month & it’s not enough, we should be together more often and stuff! The train is really early in the morning and I should sleep but I can’t! I’m so happy and excited ! "
happy,"If any of yall remember, a few weeks ago i had discovered a nest of blue eggs in my easter themed wreath. Since then we have caution taped the door and all four eggs have hatched!!!

happy,"I'm solo traveling at the moment and I've had the realisation that I'm a completely different person than I was when I was younger (I'm 32 now). I remember back then I was so insecure and I dealt with crippling anxiety. I was so self aware and ashamed of myself that I had to mentally prepare myself to do grocery shopping because I was so afraid that people would judge me. I've never been conventionally attractive, but back then I was convinced I I was absolutely hideous and I didn't deserve good things. I feel so sorry for my younger self. Now I don't give a crap about what people think of me, I've accepted myself for who I am and find beauty in small things. Sometimes I still struggle with my appearance, but not in the self destructive way as I did ten years ago.I try to always be kind to myself and treat myself how I treat good friends. At the moment I'm doing whatever I want whenever I want, all the choices I make, I make for me. It is so freeing. I feel so much love for myself, ny life, my friends and family, my work.
God I love solo traveling."
happy,"

At 26 I have finally begun to heal. 
Healing from body dysmorphia, eating disorders, exercise bulimia, severe anxiety and depression, addiction…healing my inner child whose core beliefs are that I am not skinny enough, pretty enough or worthy of love. Posting because it feels damn good to be able to look at myself and the mirror, no makeup, acne scars and all and FINALLY feel beautiful (and not feel bad about it) 
Post your healing picture - the one that makes you proud of how far you’ve come. ♥️♥️"
happy,"Recently I suffered an accident at a grappling competition. Large fracture on my right leg and 2 smaller ones near the ankle. 

&#x200B;

You would think this is a extremely low point in my life to get such a crippling injury, well you would be quite wrong. Part of is perhaps that in the end I will make a full recovery after a few months so I would be left in the end with just the humbling experience and the attitude that people now have with me.

&#x200B;

I used to think my friends are only friends with me because I am to use of them and because we have similar hobbies where we train together. Used to think I was the after thought of my family as the middle child. My feelings were always less important than my sisters, I was always supposed to support them if something happened but it never felt like it was given back.

&#x200B;

Well not only has my family offered help to even moving in with me to help me out and interrupting their lives to do so, not only have my friends all offered to drive me to the hospital and come to my place to play board games and entertain me, and even offering to do my university work but even random strangers on the street stopping their cars and asking me where am I headed and to drive me home. Old women offering to carry my bag and even the meanest looking face tattoo dudes offering help without even being asked or remotely needed.

&#x200B;

I am a 23 year old dude, used to feel alone in the world where nobody would care if something happened to me to now feel like society actually cares. Ofcourse Ive had a negative experience too but positive experience outweighs easily the one bad experience. To the people that are like the ones that help, thank you, you have no idea how much you help. I certainly would strive to become more like the selfless people that helped me when I fully recover. And dont judge the mean looking people by appearance, maybe thats how people also viewed me before, they turn out to be the most sympathetic of them all."
happy,"Made lunch clearly not fancy lol. But lovely to feel mentallyand physically okay to and wanted to after a awful time and physical pain and as he always makes me gorgeous food, proud of him and its a sunny day ❤️"
happy,"Today's been a really lovely. I felt so at peace handwashing antique quilts in textile cleaner to remove the yellow age stains so they become like new again, just a couple spots need to be patched up and already have some choice fabrics in mind (got some really nice cotton calico prints at a free sale a couple years ago and a few nice quilt squares at a church sale). Save that project for a rainy day. Went out to some yard sales today and got some nice antique furniture for really cheap and some work clothes. I love looking at how they joined wood furniture back then, no nails or screws, just complex wood joinery and yet it's so unbelievably sturdy. The solid cedar wardrobe needs to be stripped, sanded and stained with a wood oil but it's lovely and has a cute little mirror and hanger and everything. I really loved how helpful the gentleman selling it was too. He helped carry the furniture into my vehicle and he just seemed really kind and gentle. His mum raised him right. Something about this being his mum's furniture is bittersweet. That's the wonderful thing about these older pieces, they're loved and I hope whoever takes on these pieces after me, loves them equally as much. I do wonder sometimes who the craftsman is behind all of this. It's kind of paying tribute to his art and how it carries on after death. 😊🥰"
happy,"Recovery has been really rough, but I'm so proud of myself for driving and going out today, even just for a few minutes!"
happy,"For aproximately 1 month my Internet was pretty bad (5 mb download & upload kinda bad) but I finally fixed it! The problem was that one of my adapters (I don't know if that's the right word) wasn't working properly and now that I switched it out for a normal one, my internet is finally good again!

This is my first post in this sub so I'm sorry if it doesn't belong here!"
happy,"So I'm 16 and over 300lbs, and yesterday I made a post about me taking my first proper walk in over a year. Y'all made me feel so seen, I felt like I wasn't alone in this journey and I'm appreciative of all of you. I want to make an update everyday to hold myself accountable in a public space. I hope that my posts can inspire just 1 person to start doing the same. Cheers!"
happy,"I want to reciprocate with a meal subscription because he eats to live on weekdays(mainly due to work) but I want to change things up so ideas are welcome! Also, how do people keep the sparks alive when they are physically away from their partners? "
happy,"I love him so very, very much."
happy,"She told me, ""I know what it's like to not be able to leave home, so now you can."""
happy,"I had a girl I’ve been dating over for dinner and drinks last night to celebrate NYE.  Things started getting physical so I suggested going to the bedroom.  It was a hard no.

I was a little bit puzzled (we’ve had sex before).  She then informs me she has her period, appears visibly upset and apologizes.  I sort of start laughing; now she looks puzzled.

I tell her I’m chuckling at the apology; there is absolutely no reason to be sorry and I couldn’t be happier just giving her a kiss at midnight and waking up beside her tomorrow (she’s never spent the night).  I offer her a heating pad, pillows and to run out to grab some midol; whatever she needs to be comfortable, she need only let me know.

The result was a lovely young lady, stunned by the thoughtfulness and filled with appreciation.  Though I invited a ‘date’ over for dinner, we decided to become exclusive and I woke up beside my new ‘girlfriend’ the next morning.

What a great start to 2022.

Edit: inclusion of exclusivity."
happy,"And I just...

It feels so good.

Another friend, let's call her M, became super super super close with me over the past 2 months.

Anyway, tonight, my oldest friend (I've known her for like 26 years; she was my first girlfriend at like 13 years old), let's call her A, said she was really jealous about M and I was like why? And she told me she was super possessive of me.

I've always had a thing for A (except while I was in relationships) and I... guess all the signs were there. I mean... the last time we hung out she was grinding her butt all over my leg for like 20 minutes straight while I was chatting with friends at a house party. She also always makes sure to tell me she loves me before we get off the phone and she's not even remotely an affectionate woman.

I cant believe how oblivious I was.. Autism i guess haha

3 months ago I thought I was going to be alone forever. And now this on top of everything else.

Fuck 😊

I'm so happy."
happy,"Life update: you may remember me from this post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/b5p72v/comment/ejhehp6/](https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/b5p72v/comment/ejhehp6/)

But so many things have happened since then. You guys truly changed my life at that moment and I wouldn't have even gotten started without you guys. I've been picked up by a small but pretty successful publisher, DYB Publishing, for both my seven book fantasy series and science fiction trilogy.  I also went to my first anime convention last week and almost sold out (despite me almost dying from social anxiety). And I just wanted to come by and thank all of you! Also here are some pictures!

happy,"after dealing with anxiety my whole life and suffering a lot of traumatic events, i finally got the help i needed (prozac/fluoxetine) !!

i finally feel happy and less anxious, im arguing with my dad less and things are looking up ! yay !!!! 😁 life is good and it DOES in fact get better"
happy,"Basically what the title says. I don't really have anyone else to share this with, but I feel quite accomplished. My story is basically growing up poor, a bunch of federal and private loans to get a degree (out of state, had to escape the crabs in that barrel), loan to get a decent vehicle, and then I got a job as far away as I could manage. Now, just shy of my 27th birthday, all of my loans are paid off right as my employer is paying to send me back to get a master's degree in my field (I start next term). It feels like I'm free, truly free, for the first time in my life. "
happy,We’ve been dating for a year and about five months? They picked me up from my apartment and we went to a really nice restaurant. I was panicking so much.
happy,"I've always had trouble finding jeans or any kind of pants for most my life. I was either way too skinny or, after I started body building, my thighs were too big. No matter what though, the waist band was always waaaay too loose. 

Today I tried curvy fit jeans, I wish I had tried years sooner. They look so good on me!!! They fit just right. I always have to settle for the loose waistband. Not today!

The only unlucky part is I'm back down to a 00 pant size... Very hard to find on sale racks or in stores."
happy,"ljust need to let this out to some one but I'm finally happy in a relationship, my last one was exhausting and it was to the point that my new S/0 was confused why was so happy when she came into the store with me. I also almost cried when the first time I was at work and she stayed at my place she had cleaned the entire place just cuz, no one has ever done that and it ment so much to me,It just feels like such a great weight off my shoulders and made me feel something I've never felt before. I can't wait to take her on her first vacay in Sept to show how much she means to me and to spend time with he in Disney. 

Also wanted to let people know that love is out there, if this woman can love a 23 year old autistic guy with 10k in Legos, then there is hope for everyone out there."

I've had Edgar since 2020 & Wart since Summer 2023. I dress them in pet costumes (usually for cats or smaller pets like rodents/lizards) since they normally fit the best. 😀

happy,"He loves history , spiders , technology , art and America . He’s got the most wonderful blue eyes and he likes to play in the snow like me. 

It’s never been about his appearance or anything material . I love his mind. I love speaking with him. I love every word out of his mouth. I’ve truly never felt such a deep passion for somebody. 

He’s 30 and I’m 25 and I swear I went 25 years of my life searching for a mind and soul like his . 

I love when we passionately flirt with each other and talking about breathing each other in and caressing each other . 

I love staying up late at night messaging him till I fall asleep and hearing him say his praises to me . 

C I love you forever and I want to be with you forever like this 

Give it 2 more years when I’m done with school and I think we’ll get married and by 5 more I think we might be able to have a family .. 

I wanna spend every thanksgiving and Christmas with you for the rest of my life

happy,Recently I've been looking for a new drill and I went to a hardware store and saw all of the drills where 100-200 bucks! So I decided to travel to (generic value store) and got a hammer drill for 25 dollars! it works amazing and has 2 modes and I'm really happy about it!

happy,"I work by myself in animal rescue in a place where abandoned animals is pretty common. After my money goes into them and my own groceries, I often have next to nothing to spend on myself. For the last year and a half, I was sleeping on an old donated sofa bed in the main room. But my birthday was last month, and some friends chipped in to buy me the mattress, bed frame, and even new pillows and bedsheets! I did end up building it myself, which took the whole month because I had to find time between running around doing animal stuff, so it feels like my accomplishment too. I just feel so proud of myself and so happy and lucky to have great friends.

happy,"If a genie or another supernatural being approached me when I was 10 years old and asked me for three wishes, I would definitely ask for the following: 

* to find true love (I was a very romantic kid, haha)
*  to become a teacher
*  and to make video games. 

It took a long time, but finally, at the age of 30, I met the most wonderful woman ever, and she miraculously fell in love with me too. That happened in 2016. 

For various reasons, I had started and quit my studies multiple times. However, in 2020, I was finally able to teach my first class in high school! Yes, it was the year of the pandemic, and it was challenging, but I loved it and it has become my profession. 

In January of this year (2023), I decided that it was time to seriously pursue making video games. In November, I released my first game! It was an amazing experience, to the point that game development has become my number one hobby. 

I don't know what the future holds, what 2024 will bring for me or for anyone reading this, but I hope we all continue to pursue our wishes, and maybe even reach them. Happy new year!"
happy,"Hi, Everyone.

I was going to wait a week, but I had to create an account and post this because I’m just too happy to keep it inside anymore.

A few days ago, my wife posted on this board. She was having a tough time sleeping, and in the middle of this rough night, the thought of something I did brought a smile to her face. She shared that moment with everyone here, and in response, the amount of goodwill and kindness that flowed from this community was overwhelming. 

She kept this post secret from me—never expecting it to make other than a few people smile. Little did she know, it would gain a ton of traction. The generosity and support that followed made it tough for her to conceal, and eventually, she showed me the thought that made her so happy this past Monday at 3 A.M..

My wife is amazing. I’m so happy, lucky, and fortunate to be in that group of people who have truly found their soulmate. My heart becomes full just thinking about her, and sometimes I just say her name randomly because it makes me happy to hear. I love her so much, and I can’t stop smiling right now.

I also want to take a moment to thank everyone in this community. What you all did truly shows the amazing types of people you are. From the messages of encouragement, to the acts of support, it’s a been such a joy. I’ll never forget any of it, and when I called my mother to tell her about what everyone here did, it seriously made her day.

Thank you all so much. You made my wife happy. You made my mom happy. For that, I will forever be grateful, and I promise to do my best to spread all the positive energy you gave us back out into the world.

This truly is the bright center of the Internet."
happy,"It's been a long journey with a lot of ups and downs, but I've finally found myself a job I can manage with hours that work for me despite my disability - and I thought I was doing ok, but it turns out I've been doing great! I work in health care and it's really important to me that my patients feel cared for and respected, so I'm overjoyed that I've apparently got so much positive feedback from my patients, as well as the other medical staff I work with. I'm not naturally a ""people person"" so it's pretty exhausting putting on my mask for every person who walks through my door, but this makes it feel worthwhile. 

To everyone who worries that they'll never be able to manage in the workplace, don't lose hope! When you're ready, keep searching and the right job could come along when you least expect it. I was struggling so much after years of trying to survive in the workplace that I ended up on a disability pension, deemed unable to work at all. Now I do five mornings a week, which isn't a lot by ""normal people"" standards, but I'm proud that I've made it this far. It's not the job I dreamed of doing and it isn't prestigious or glamorous but it's important work that I'm providing to the community. Everyone has something they can offer to the world, for some of us it just takes longer to find it. "
happy,Context I love love LOVE stuffed animals cause they make me happy I have A LOT. I actually went TWICE to the dentist! I got a whole root canal which is crazy and then the second time I went I didn’t even use the carbon monoxide ONCE. This is a record for me! I use it every time cause I have anxiety and I did jump off the seat one time and cried but that’s it! Usually I just completely leave! This is big progress! It was for the crown over my tooth nothing major but it was a lot for me and I had to go home and sleep after but I can’t believe I did it I’m so happy! That’s the shirt I was originally gonna wear but couldn’t but it’s okay cause I found my Bob’s Burgers shirt (the one I always always always wear to the dentist) and I just think the last two pictures are cute!
happy,"Made me happy, They seem happy. I'm filming the wild monkeys that frequent my garden and was surprised with how quickly doing this brought joy to my life...only thing is I am a bit attached now.

happy,I've been using a Couch to 5k app that uses progressive overload to help you run a 5k. My mental health has been tanking so working out for MYSELF hits different. Potential weightloss a huge benefit. Anyways. Super proud of myself after being a potato for the last few years! 🥰😀
happy,I went to the dentist and I’m scared of them but they let me listen to music so I listened to stuff from Bob’s Burgers (my special interest) and I wore my pink slippers and Bob’s Burgers shirt! I found my Phoebe Bridgers shirt again and I got candy since I couldn’t eat it before! My cavities on my front teeth are filled well the one is but I’m so happy I never thought I’d do it !!!

Hi, i just got in high school last week and I didn't know anyone except for a friend of mine that ended up on the same school as me. A friend of her  also ended up there (wich i didn't know until yesterday). I just think it's worth to say that my social skills are terrible (expected from a reddit user lol), and i just find so difficult to start conversations, meeting people and stuff like that. On the first week i was dead silent, didn't talk to anyone, i was too shy and embarrassed, and felt like i would be a inconvenience to anyone just trying to stay in peace. Then yesterday (second week already), that friend of mine and her friend were talking to each other and they came to my desk to say something, and just stayed there for the rest of the lunch break, and we talked for a while until the class resumed. But today was even cooler, some of the teachers didn't show up on class, and we just talked the entire time about our lives. And believe it or not, it gets even cooler: we live in the same region, so we get the same buses on our way to home, and guess what: we talked the entire way lol. It just feels so nice to have someone to talk with that isn't on the internet, i was really missing that in-person social interactions haha.
Anyway, i think I've never typed so much in english, I hope only the best for y'all, cya ;P"
happy,"This is so weird , but a few days ago my boyfriend and I went into a little no-contact stage after a small argument we had over something petty . 

It wasn’t specific or anything but we both just stopped reaching out and got busy . 


Well yesterday after like 2 days of no contact , I go to message him on instagram and the second my message delivered, I received a message from him on text message 😂 

We literally messaged each other at the exact same moment after 2 days and were thinking of each other exactly at the same moment 

So adorable haha "
happy,So I wanted to share that something rly good happened to me in my career/job today and I usually share these things with my gf of 5 years but we recently broke up and I have no one to share the happiness im feeling right now so I thought I'd just post it here :) 
happy,Happy family. 🙂
happy,"I lived with my best friend when I was twenty, and then when I went back to school she got her own place. Then I moved back in with my parents for a while, then I moved into my boyfriend and then husband now ex's house for two years. And now at 29, I'm out of the marriage, and for the first time I'm gonna be living my dream of my very own apartment! I've wanted this for so long it's like a dream come true 🥰🥰🥰 I can't wait to move in on the first!!!!"
happy,I felt so happy to see nature and these ducks. 
happy,"Like the title, I’ve moved far away from home and I had never done this before. I always lived in the place where I was born. I honestly never even thought I would move. Last year, I was promoted to manager for a company and I had a LOT of work to do. I needed help, but then lost some accounts and didn’t need as much help anymore. Someone told me early last year that they should’ve taken the opportunity to move back home when they had the chance (to my hometown - he was helping me for a while, and he lived 400+ miles away.)

It was a seed in the back of my mind to POSSIBLY eventually move. His best friend moved to my hometown to help me full time. Meanwhile, I grew feelings for a friend who said he was moving to where this guy lives. I still thought about moving, but thought there’s no way I would move for a guy just because I like him. (We aren’t in a relationship, but I am crazy about him. lol) 

Well, as luck (or fate?) would have it, I lost even more business at work through no fault of my own. I was desperate for a change because I needed to make more money. I don’t have a roommate and I have bills I need to be able to pay. No other job applications were going anywhere. My friend that I mentioned above suggested that I move out of my hometown, and I thought it might actually not be a bad idea to have more work in a bigger city, like he said. I thought really intensely about it and talked about it with my closest friends and family. 

Even the guy who worked for me was afraid of losing his job. I told him not to worry because I was thinking of moving to take his best friend’s place - he was in a hard spot financially too, and would have help in my hometown to get back on his feet. Every single person I told about the possibility of me moving said to 100% do it. (Well, aside from my parents, but they have been supportive even when I told them my crush moved away. I thought they were the crazy ones for that. LOL)

I got home from vacation after thinking long and hard about moving, and I drafted the email to send to my boss about moving to two possible locations. One because I had family there, and the other because I KNEW the other guy wanted to move earlier in the year back to my hometown. I had just spent my vacation near where he was living, and I liked it - but I was NOT thinking of moving when I took that trip. Lo and behold, when I got back home, I nearly went negative in my bank account. I had to return socks and underwear because I just couldn’t afford it. My car payment was coming up and I was so scared. 

I thought about if I were to move, what amount of money would I need to do it? The number $5k popped up and I figured that would be just enough to move. I had no idea how I would get the money. As if by magic, within 3 days, I never went negative in the bank and I had $5k to my name in addition to everything I needed for bills that month. My boss was totally willing to facilitate the move and the guy was desperate to move back home, even though he didn’t WANT to leave. He HAD to leave. 

It’s just been amazing how smoothly this has all worked out. I was terrified of moving here because I don’t know anyone very well, but I do have some friends in the surrounding areas whom I hope to get to know better. The cherry on top is that the friend I have feelings for lives here too, but I am not going to push anything with him. I didn’t move here FOR him, but it’s definitely a big perk, in my opinion. I don’t even know if he likes me at all. But it’s just so weird how everything has panned out. I am not complaining though. I absolutely adore this place already. 

All my life I thought I would hate it up here. I can’t think of a single negative other than my small family and my closest friends aren’t here. However, since moving, I am actually talking to my friends and family MORE than before! They care about my whereabouts and how I am doing so they are checking on me more often and making more of an effort, which is really nice. 

I am just so elated to be here in my quiet little bubble - in a beautiful city, which so far hasn’t given me anxiety much at all, despite it being so much bigger than where I am from. Everyone has been so incredibly friendly and, again, everything has been so smooth. It feels like it was meant to be. My mind is blown by this experience and honestly, it’s only been 48 hours, but I don’t think I’ll ever move back home unless I absolutely have to, and even then, I am sure it would be temporary."
happy,"I'm a 30yr old woman and I've never really played with Legos before. My husband is an avid Lego lover, both as a kid and as an adult, and has recently wanted to get back into building them. 

I know there have been some really cool sets to come out in the past couple of years (some look like flowers or little zen gardens or insects one might pin, etc) so when he got himself a set today I also looked. I found this darling little bonsai tree and he offered to get it for me so we could build together! 

We both put ours together tonight and it was so much fun! I didn't realize that the cherry blossoms were actually little pink frogs until I got to that section. My little bonsai is chilling with its adorable little pink frogs on my counter and I could not be more pleased!

And for anyone wondering, hubby got himself the Thanos glove and he is pleased as punch! 😊"
happy,"I posted something in this sub a little less than 6 months ago after being clean for 2 weeks (I deleted the post for unrelated reasons) and while I got a lot of support I also got a lot of crap because it was ""only two weeks, come back when you have actually achieved something"".  Well, [here I am](http://imgur.com/gallery/ZDd7cMS), 6 months later, still clean, recently engaged, just got into a computer programming program, and have never been happier.  I just resolved my legal issues last week, actually have a savings of more than $2K, am rebuilding relationships with my family members and have nothing but optimism and hope for the future I never bothered to think about before.

Just wanted to use today to send out a PSA to anyone struggling with addiction - it can and DOES get better.  I am here for anyone that needs support.

happy,"My absolute angel of a mother in law and I are taking my future sister in law to a little tea house as surprise! We just told her to be ready to go at a certain time and have sworn all the boys to secrecy 😊. 

Mother in law, future sister in law and I really love tea so I really hope she likes it. Both of these ladies are absolute gems to be around and I cannot be more excited to have my future sister in law join the family ❤️. She is so sweet and considerate and sassy and I love her so much! And mother in law is an absolute doll. Anything and everything she can do to help, she'll do. She's a tiny spit fire of a woman and won't hesitate to show you what-for like she's 8 feet tall lol. 

My blood family has never treated me half as well as these ladies do and I am just so blessed to know them and have them in my life!

happy,"I’m in community college, and I found that for this semester (spring semester) I’d gotten a bad English professor. I received a 25/50 on an assignment due to not formatting it correctly - on ratemyprofessor, many students were complaining about his oddly specific formatting rules (this man expected us to read five pages to adhere to his formatting guidelines… no thanks!) I’d actually started the assignment I received a 25/50 on early and had trouble submitting it in the docx form he really wanted us to submit it in, had to stop my Child Development Zoom meeting to call my college’s tech support at nighttime just to find a way to submit this assignment. This professor said he “wasn’t sure” and that I “still had time to call” when I asked him if I’d receive a 0 if I was unable to get the document submitted by the deadline even though I mentioned I’d started it early and that it was done. 

After much crying yesterday when seeing I had a 25/50 (this lowered my grade to a D+… I’ve never had a D+ in an English class) I simply decided, even though it means I’ll only be taking three courses this semester, to just drop the class. I have a job, I don’t know what I see myself doing in the future, and I felt like I just don’t have time for this, so I chose to drop the class. No extra stress needed. And I have no regrets about dropping it."

happy,"Hey all, today I woke up and stepped on a weight scale and saw it was 158.5lbs :) I was around 202lbs when I started and it's amazing I reached into the 150 range, the last recorded weight of me I can remember was being around 160 a couple years back and it has only gone up since then. The fact I'm lower than that makes me extremely proud of myself and that change really is possible! 

It really helps I also have my boyfriend supporting me and he's one of my main motivators, he helps me feel secure and safe :D

There were times I ""failed"" and felt terrible about myself that I didn't keep myself in check, then I always tell myself, ""it's a marathon, not a race"" and that along the way you will have difficulties snacking, plateaus, and others where you just go beyond your calories for the day. But also, times where you'll do it and be succcessful. In the end they all add up and you will see that no matter what, that you DID lose weight because you didn't give up regardless of all the missteps. The smallest steps are my favorite, esp at the beginning! Because something is working. The scale isn't always accurate and fluctuates, so I take pictures and the differenc is very noticable :)

Super proud of myself, and thankful to my boyfriend in this journey."
happy,"I’ve been in for four years, four years since I was seventeen. It’s been an experience and I’m so glad that I can go back home and see my family, my friends, travel more freely, attend university. I’ve never been more satisfied with my position now that this chapter of my life is finally coming to a close."
happy,"Dropped out of college in 2013, became a licensed cosmetologist in my state… worked hair full time for 9 years. Went back to school. 

Graduated, passed exams. I am a certified nurse aide. "
happy,"We sat and talked for 6 hours yesterday and she said a lot of sweet things to me; like saying I was one of the best things to happen to her (I said that one first; she just said it back). I wish I wrote down the rest of them because I already forgot most of it (my memory is so bad and my life is so dramatically different than it was 3 months ago; new huge things are happening every week; last night I just got the keys to a house on the beach in Venice). There was one thing she said which did stick out, though:

""You're my type: extraordinary.""

No one has ever come close to making me that happy with less than 6 words.

Anyway, I'm about to make one of the biggest pivots of my life. I got an offer to leave the US and move to Switzerland\* and possibly Germany for a bit, so I'm working to change every last piece of me that has been holding me back. I don't know what I will resemble at the end of this, but I know, to at least one person, one of the most amazing people I've ever met, they found me extraordinary at one point in my life.

I honestly don't know that I could ask for a better compliment.

Anyway.

To future me, if you end up reading this, and you're feeling down, you were extraordinary to one of the most amazing people you ever met. That should not ever not matter to you.

\* it was somehow endearing how upset she got over this; I hate hurting her, even if it was inadvertent, but seeing her very upset texts burst through as I'm ""reviving"" my dead phone from an eventful night, was so \*damn\* heart-warming."
happy,"Me (16F) and this one guy friend really like to wrestle every once in a while, its super fun and even though he beats me in height, weight, and strength, I’m pretty persistent and am comfortable getting thrown around haha

We had a pretty long talk laying on some grass after an eventful last practice for an extracurricular, as he’s a hs senior leaving in a couple of days. When i brought up how much i appreciated fighting him (it sounds dumb but you know haha), he said he agreed, but no one else really liked to anymore, even his sister. After that, he said something along the lines of “i think I’m kind of like a big brother to you” and that made me really happy because although i wouldnt realistically call him that ive always seen him in a similar light and as a role model

anyone else love wrestling your friends?"
happy,I've never experienced love like this before. I'm actually happy now ☺️
happy,"*Kevin Kelly* is a forward thinker, speaker and author. He founded *Wired* magazine and writes with great insight. Six years ago he turned 68. For each year of his life, he gifted a piece of advice to his children; things he wished he had known at their age. Each year since, on his birthday, he has added to that initial list. Below are ten pieces of advice from *Kevin*’s 74th birthday update, relating to happiness, habits and progress.

# Happiness

1. Where you live (what city, what country) has more impact on your well-being than any other factor. Where you live is one of the few things in your life you can choose and change. In my biased option, *Bath* is a beautiful city. It’s been my home for the last 30 years and brings me great joy.
2. The highest form of wealth is deciding you have enough. My instinct is to believe that if I had more money, I’d be happier. However, those richer and wiser than me have persuaded me otherwise.
3. You’ll never meet a very successful pessimistic person. If you want to be remarkable, get better at being optimistic. I can choose how I interpret the world. I chose to be optimistic with a dose of realism.
4. Asking “what-if?” about your past is a waste of time; asking “what-if?” about your future is tremendously productive. I can’t change the past, but I can influence the future.

# Habits

1. What is important is seldom urgent and what is urgent is seldom important. To get the important stuff done, avoid the demands of the urgent. I try to ensure that activities with longer term benefits are addressed.
2. If you are out of ideas, go for a walk. A good walk empties the mind and then refills it with new stuff. My daily walk gives me space to think and reflect. A life changer for me.
3. You have 5 minutes to act on a new idea before it disappears from your mind. If I have an idea, I note it down in my mobile notes app.

# Progress

1. The best way to criticise something is to make something better. I love building things and seeing others use them.
2. The more persistent you are, the more chances you get to be lucky. I find the concept of increasing one’s *luck surface area* to be an empowering idea. I try to position myself to take advantage of lucky breaks.
3. Decisions like to present themselves as irreversible, like a one-way door. But most deciding points are two-way. Don’t get bogged down by decisions. You can usually back up if needed. Few things in life are permanent. While hard to comprehend, this reality is liberating.

happy,"Recently, I went to the movie theater with my kid, and while we were waiting for the movie to start, we played duck-catching. We were both thrilled to catch two of them, and I was delighted to capture this moment. I sincerely felt that happiness can be found in the simplest of things and tastes even better when the joy is shared with a loved one."
happy,"I remember getting a notif, looking at my phone, then freaking my family out cuz I just suddenly started jumping up and down yelling 12 DOLLARS! 12 DOLLARS! 😂

I really came a long way with working on music, putting my heart into beats just to make people dance and forget about whatever troubles them, so seeing people begin to support me made me feel happy beyond words.

Finally I can consider myself an actual artist, not just a hobbyist making music for fun, but an actual artist that was capable of inspiring others.

I never thought I'd make it to this point, I know it's a very small win, but its the first step towards many other milestones yet to come.

I have many people to thank, the yt community and soundcloud, but I think Id be years behind if it werent for niche communities on reddit supporting me all the way through.

Its only January and it's already a big year for me ❤️"
happy,This is my girlfriend of 7 years and both of our kids 5 year old girl and 3 year old boy. We both worked a long day but wanted to treat our kids to some fun at the park before the sun went down and go to Dairy Queen to end the night! We have been through some hard times but no matter what the light always will shine the next day and I have to keep my light shining!!!
happy,Been slightly over 2 and a half years sober but my third birthday sober...working towards my third year this August and this pupper means the world to me. Hes my little buddy and I owe him so much.
happy,"I know nothing big but it still makes me happy as I can go to sleep for today now.
Only 1 more thing to programm tomorrow and I will be more or less done!"
happy,"Recently I suffered an accident at a grappling competition. Large fracture on my right leg and 2 smaller ones near the ankle. 

&#x200B;

You would think this is a extremely low point in my life to get such a crippling injury, well you would be quite wrong. Part of is perhaps that in the end I will make a full recovery after a few months so I would be left in the end with just the humbling experience and the attitude that people now have with me.

&#x200B;

I used to think my friends are only friends with me because I am to use of them and because we have similar hobbies where we train together. Used to think I was the after thought of my family as the middle child. My feelings were always less important than my sisters, I was always supposed to support them if something happened but it never felt like it was given back.

&#x200B;

Well not only has my family offered help to even moving in with me to help me out and interrupting their lives to do so, not only have my friends all offered to drive me to the hospital and come to my place to play board games and entertain me, and even offering to do my university work but even random strangers on the street stopping their cars and asking me where am I headed and to drive me home. Old women offering to carry my bag and even the meanest looking face tattoo dudes offering help without even being asked or remotely needed.

&#x200B;

I am a 23 year old dude, used to feel alone in the world where nobody would care if something happened to me to now feel like society actually cares. Ofcourse Ive had a negative experience too but positive experience outweighs easily the one bad experience. To the people that are like the ones that help, thank you, you have no idea how much you help. I certainly would strive to become more like the selfless people that helped me when I fully recover. And dont judge the mean looking people by appearance, maybe thats how people also viewed me before, they turn out to be the most sympathetic of them all."
happy,"Recently Ive opened myself up expanded my horizons and gotten with some really cool people, microbiologists, actresses from london, screenwriters from new york, Bob Ross trained painters, wave scientists, hang gliding instructors. 

Just wanted to put it out there and be grateful for the opportunities that have come my way in the last couple of months.

 Who would have thought that there were so many opportunities, experiences, and pretty faces out there.


“My troubles will be few”"
happy,"After being rejected for an early admission, and direct admission, I still tried to appeal for a third time to get into the college course I wanted. I just got the results that I was SUCCESSFUL!!!!!! I'M SO HAPPY I'M CRYING I MADE IT I MADE IT. I had absolutely no hope for if i didn't get accepted and was considering giving up entirely"
happy,"So I’ve been wanting to be more like my awesome marathon runner Papa. He’s always been a wonderful athlete! Running marathons when he was younger to playing softball now, in his 80’s. He’s the coolest guy, I’m dying to be more like him. Not just physically but emotionally too. He’s always been so chill. 

I set a goal to try to walk five miles every other day just to start, and to my surprise I’ve actually gone and done it! Pokémon GO tracks the duration of my walks and I’ve walked more than thirty miles each week for the past three weeks. I’m over the moon! 🐮 Just wanted to share some happy news. I hope you all have a nice day today!  

"
happy,"I was asked by one of my friends if I wanted to go to her church and I said yes because I don’t usually get to hang out with her outside of school. When I got there it was loud but the music was good, after a while we then got food that was absolutely delicious 😋, It was Spaghetti, garlic bread, and fried chicken, plus a salad and a cup of apple juice :D, I ate and had fun talking to my friend and when we left we got Starbucks, me and my friend listened to music for the rest of the car ride to my home. I’m now home and I just really wanted to share what happened today, Sadly this was the first year I didn’t celebrate Easter with a Easter egg hunt but I still had just as much of a good time as the other past years :)

Be Happy guys 😁🙌❤️"
happy,"Man oh MAN!!! First off, im absolutely fucking ZOOTED off a 5mg candy. 2nd today was so freakin FUN! Long story short, i have been sober but a 5 year streak of Alcoholism. I slowed down to only on special occasions starting on my birthday (July 31) of last year, only drank christmas, thanksgiving, and once a week before christmas because i had found out my dad needed heart bypass surgery, last try out drink was a shot in February of this year and i have not drank SHIT since. Anyways, today i took my brother to the dispensary. It was his first time and i said it was on me. I got home and i felt so good i just wanted to share. 

Ive always wanted to cross of my bucket list have a first experience with one of my siblings. I know thats a odd experience but the way my brother was excited to go with me was so filling. It was just the fact that we got to enjoy a shared interest. although i do not condone drug use if it is illegal in your state, like i said, sharing a similar interest together was great. He even said “Next time i get paid, it’s on me.” 

Today was great. I feel so whole again. My heart feels so light for the first time in years and im just so excited to enjoy more things in life after feeling so low for such a long time. 
"
happy,"I want to reciprocate with a meal subscription because he eats to live on weekdays(mainly due to work) but I want to change things up so ideas are welcome! Also, how do people keep the sparks alive when they are physically away from their partners? "
happy,"First of all, English isn't my first language so please understand. 

I come from a country and a community where dating culture isn't very big. Me and my brother have a 8 year age gap (he's younger). As a result, we don't relate to the same stuff, share similar likes/dislikes or even talk a lot about our personal lives or choices. Although I find a friend in him and he's been protective, caring; he barely talks about his friends, or problems, etc. 

But today! Oh boy, I'm still smiling ear to ear!
Today he called me out of the blue( lives in a different city) and asked me for an outfit suggestion because he was going to go meet this girl he has had a crush on. That alone, made me so happy! In that moment, I knew he found me helpful, I knew he trusted me with that as probably my parents would not approve of him skipping classes to go meet her, and I was happy that he came to me when he felt like he was stuck.
I gave him a suggestion, appropriate for a first date (of his life) and he left. I was fine, happy that he was happy. It was just a little meet at a cafe at evening, they decided to have some snacks, talk etc and head back their own ways.

Fast forward three hours, HE CALLED me.. n he told me how great the date was!! I NEVER expected he'd call and share that with me! N he was so giggly (I don't know if that's even a word, sorry) and chirpy and happy and nervous and so much more lol! He told me, that she looked so beautiful this evening, that he couldn't utter a word. So he scrolled through Instagram, luckily came across a picture of  beautifully arranged flowers and he sent that post to her with a message that said - ""you look this beautiful today"". My little brother, ladies and gentlemen!! He's 19. 19!!! We never have seen anyone go on a date except in movies and stuff ig. And this guy was like 5yo just a couple years ago 🥺🥺When did he grow up so fast! 

N to top all that, he thanked me - he THANKED ME for helping him know how to treat a girl right! He thinks I'm nice. He trusts me. He ACTUALLY looks up to me!!🥺
I. Am. Melting! 
I'm happy a ton! Sorry if this is too long. To the ones who stuck till the end, you people are my angels. I just wanted to share this. ❤️

"
happy,"I’m so excited. This is a job I’ve wanted for ages and I feel like people take me seriously and respect me professionally, which I’ve never really experienced as I’m still 20 and in college. 

I get to go to a new city I’ve never seen before, go to fancy dinners every night and get paid for it!! Also I feel like I’ve made my dad proud of me so that’s an added bonus. "
happy,"So basically I (20 M) have lost a shit ton of weight from say weighing 120 kilograms to right now weighing 83 kgs. I regularly go to the gym and I have them muscles too. There's just one teeny tiny issue. I was a hell of a glutton when I was chubby, and that habit still persists in the form of my sweet tooth and binge eating, though not often. 
Today, particularly, I'd eaten more than I'm supposed to, on my calorie deficit, by say 200-300 kcals, and all the PTSD came rushing to my head. I know it's not healthy, but this does not happen often. Okay so, my girlfriend rudely cut my video call cause her friend called and the girls had a nice time putting on face masks and stuff (when my girl (19 F) had told me before that she would do that with me on video call, while we talk.) So obviously this made me feel bad, and along with the PTSD, made my emotions avalanche down the fkin mountain. 
Cue me calling my girl a bit later, she goes ""tell me what's the matter"" in the most bored voice ever. I couldn't stop myself, tears started flowing down my eyes. I didn't know how to tell her what the matter was, and that made my emotions plummet even more.
However, after a while, I gathered composure, told my girlfriend the reasons, that I missed my father, and my grandmothers every single day, think about the days they were alive, and that I get motivation from them, to succeed. I told her about the PTSD regarding my body image issues, and what I consider as freedom from this: I want to be able to rip of my shirt and wear shorts without worrying about my physique whatsoever. (Not to mention I want that athletic physique and am working towards it). 
Where I knew that I'd won, with her as my girlfriend, is when she listened through everything, then at the end, told me stuff I exactly wanted to hear. That how she'd shown a pump picture of mine to one of her guy friends and how the guy praised my physique, how she'd storied a picture of me with a beautiful Persian cat (she was absolutely wonderful, the cat) on instagram, and how her friend replied ""Where were such beautiful and wonderful guys when I was searching for them? What kinda black magic did you perform that suddenly you get such a great guy to be your boyfriend?"". I feel absolutely elated right now.
There was this day I wore a semi-transparent shirt out, and my girl said today: listen babe, yk, I know we went to a temple that day but I could not help thinking unholy shit to do to you.
I am so fucking happy right now. i hope I marry this girl someday."
happy,I've been using a Couch to 5k app that uses progressive overload to help you run a 5k. My mental health has been tanking so working out for MYSELF hits different. Potential weightloss a huge benefit. Anyways. Super proud of myself after being a potato for the last few years! 🥰😀
happy,"Least year, at this time, I walked out the hospital after a week there of perfusions and treatments after discovering I had an episode of ITP. Today marks one year without an episode. Living the life!"
happy,"I spent eight years in an incredibly abusive relationship. Emotionally, mentally, and physically. I was devalued every step of the way and never realized that there were people taking advantage of me. But about two years ago I found people who actually love and care about me, realized my family loves me and that I was being lied to that they didn't. The people who used me did and still will claim I'm a failure, but they wouldn't be where they are without me. But more importantly, I've now surrounded myself with smart, empathetic, kind, successful people and my heart is full of happiness and love now because of it. I have a wonderful relationship, a successful career, and so much to look forward to. I'm so lucky to have what I have now. I'm so happy that I left and can now be a better person for it. I have so much hope for the future that I could never have had before, and I look forward to all of the happiness and success waiting for me now that I've moved on to better things."
happy,I can’t even describe this. I feel so light and nice and light and my head is spinning 
happy,"It looks like no big thing, normal achievements for most people, but 2 years ago I was depressed, no job, no money, no friends, single, my mental health wasn't good at all. Now I'm working, I have a job, I met a girl that I really like, she became my girlfriend, and I started to work out, I've gained a few pounds, my physique looks better now.

I'm really proud of myself and feeling happy. I felt like sharing it because depressed people can change their life for the better, it's not easy but it's possible!"
happy,"Hey all! I've been on the weightloss train for nearly 3-4 years now! I am only 5',3"", so at my biggest of 215lbs, I was quite heavy for my size. 
I began to simply just eat less, take in less sugar, reduce my portions, and begin walking (10k steps a day). 
Towards the end of my journey I began running and working out as well, which helped me over come plateaus, as well as reducing sugar to nearly 0. 
I am now 120lbs. I may lose 5 more pounds to be 115lbs, but we'll see. It took me nearly half a decade, but I can rest now knowing it is finally accomplished! "
happy,"Im 17F, a highschool senior, the past year I’ve been doing an engineering internship at a different company that sells stuff that refineries and other companies buy, including this company. I also placed 3rd at a state drafting competition. My school guidance counselor got an email from this refinery saying they saw my accomplishments in the newspaper and are offering me an internship.

HOLY SHIT THIS IS MASSIVE. THIS PLACE IS NOTORIOUS FOR BEING DIFFICULT TO GET INTO!! AND IM NOT EVEN IN COLLEGE EITHER!!!! I AM ACTUALLY SO HAPPY. 

I don’t know what exactly I did to get this, BUT IM NOT COMPLAINING YIPPEEEEEE"
happy,"Don't get me wrong, I'm not racist and I love all the cats!

It's just... ragdoll cats not only are incredibly fluffy and with beautiful eyes but their personality is just so damn awwww :3

They're so damn cuddly. Them being so big and heavy makes it so much better. You get more cat out of a cat I just can't

For sure there's fur everywhere and you need to take great care of them but I find it difficult to even consider that con because of how great they are hahaha"
happy,"Tomorrow marks one whole month of not purging or throwing up, and recovering from my second bout with bulimia!!"
happy,"I’m feeling really proud of myself, and I’m super appreciative of all of the people that gave me feedback and help along the way. Wanted to share this feeling with everyone!!"
happy,"Celebrating all the amazing mothers out there, Happy Mother's Day! Your love and dedication never go unnoticed. Share your cherished memories with Mom today! 

#MothersDay"
happy,"The last time I had one I was 8, it lasted 2years and I always wanted to try VTT. Always wanted my own bike to move to to work ect I am proud of myself"
happy,"I (20f) grew up with an emotionally abusive mother who neglected me and favoured my two older half brothers. I grew up on tv because I was a socially awkward kid and any friends I did have would want to hang with my brothers instead (we have a 6 and 7 year age gap. So when I was 8 they were teens). I saw that on a lot of my favourite shows there would be at least one picnic episode where the family would go to a park with the classic red and white blanket and eat out of a basket. I always wanted that. I would ask my mom if we could do it with her, my brothers and me ( my parents divorced when I was three and my dad had custody on weekends) but my brothers just wanted to go to the skatepark with their junkie friends. My mom chose them over me every time. So when I was 14 I stopped asking cause I knew that the one day I wanted with my family didn’t matter as much as wasting hours watching my brothers do the same old tricks. 
Anyway I haven’t seen my mother since I was 15 when my dad got full custody of me after my mom disappeared with her boyfriend of the week for a couple days. I have a carer cause I was diagnosed with autism at 13. I asked if we could do a picnic one day with just us fully prepared to be rejected but she said yes. So tomorrow we’re buying a basket and food and sitting on a blanket in the park having a picnic. 

Also mom… Fuck you. "
happy,"I had a girl I’ve been dating over for dinner and drinks last night to celebrate NYE.  Things started getting physical so I suggested going to the bedroom.  It was a hard no.

I was a little bit puzzled (we’ve had sex before).  She then informs me she has her period, appears visibly upset and apologizes.  I sort of start laughing; now she looks puzzled.

I tell her I’m chuckling at the apology; there is absolutely no reason to be sorry and I couldn’t be happier just giving her a kiss at midnight and waking up beside her tomorrow (she’s never spent the night).  I offer her a heating pad, pillows and to run out to grab some midol; whatever she needs to be comfortable, she need only let me know.

The result was a lovely young lady, stunned by the thoughtfulness and filled with appreciation.  Though I invited a ‘date’ over for dinner, we decided to become exclusive and I woke up beside my new ‘girlfriend’ the next morning.

What a great start to 2022.

Edit: inclusion of exclusivity."
happy,"Even in the middle of the storm, there are small places to breath"
happy,Sorry the picture is lame
happy,That’s all. I’m a 53-year-old woman and I melted right then and there.
happy,"This morning I was going to work and it was dark but I saw my bf pass me on the highway on our way to work, I instantly got butterflies. Then when I got to the Dunkin drive thru who do I see in front of me….. it’s him. Lol I didn’t think he would notice but then when I got to the window to pay for my coffee the cashier said “here you go. The gentleman in front of you already paid” it’s the little things. y’all I’m so in love 🥰 "
happy,I work retail. I don't remember the last time I was called kind.
happy,"I (30f) have been married to my wonderful husband for 4yrs and we dated for 2 before getting married. My in-laws have been wonderful to me the entire time. My FIL is like a second father and my MIL is like the mother I never had. Through the duration of my relationship with my husband, I have also been helping him heal his relationship with his parents, i.e making sure boundaries are maintained and communication lines remain open and honest whilst still being kind and considerate. 

My father suddenly passed away about a month ago and it's been really difficult as it was very unexpected but my husband, my friends and my inlaws have really rallied around and made sure I am okay. I've spoken to my husband and my inlaws and it has been decided that they will move in with us into my father's house to 1: help us with some bills and maintaining my father's property and 2: help them because they do not own the place they live now and will need some help as they are getting closer to retirement age. 

My FIL is disabled and on SSA benefits. I am also trying to get disability as I have not been able to work in almost 2 years due to a variety of health issues. My FIL has been so understanding and helpful with tips and tricks on how to do things around the house while chronically in pain or what processes are helpful in going through the disability thing. My MIL has been a real trooper through all of this and has helped keep me grounded as well. My husband is actually excited to live with his parents again because while I understand that his relationship with his parents is completely different than what I had with my dad, I don't want him to go through what I'm going through with any regrets and such. 

It just feels like a spotlight in a very dark time and I really love my husband and my in-laws. Even my brother in-law and future sister-in-law have been super amazing and accommodating and kind. I really love the family I married into and l hope they know I love them too."
happy,I’m 44. Never thought I’d have kids. Today that changed. Say hi to Annie.
happy,"After dealing with both clogged ears since Oct 2022, multiple ER visits, walk-in clinics, doctors, mineral oils, hydrogen peroxide, failed referrals to ENTS, I finally found an ear doctor that was willing to help me. He was able to unclog both my ears!

I can finally hear again. 

Nature, music, sounds I never heard before are all overwhelming. It’s like having surround sound!

Grateful for the small things. I am happy not to ask people to repeat themselves anymore!"
happy,"Update

I was going through a bad state well was about to but I got through it because of one special girl that I have been with for 3 months yes we are long distance but I got to see her for 2 days and that was the happiest I have been since my popow I feel amzing right now I really love her thank you for all the kind comments last time 😁"
happy,"my boyfriend and i are both 16. were immature, sometimes a little petty, but undoubtedly in love. my mother died before i met him, but since he’s known me he’s supported me through the grief of losing her and even has visited her grave by himself on his own time. he helps me talk about her, and says that he wishes he could have known her. it means more than he knows.

i come from a drug addict mother and angry father, so my model for a relationship wasn’t the best. i’ve messed up with him, i’ve said things i didn’t mean when i was upset, but he’s been nothing but patient with me. he’s taught me how to talk things out and admit when i’m upset about something, and to not harbor my emotions.

he’s making me a better person, and i love him unconditionally. he’s the first person i’ve been comfortable enough to let him see every single side of me, mentally and behaviorally. anyways, just wanted to say there are still good people out there, and everyone deserves someone who treats them the way my boyfriend treats me!! "
happy,"It’s not been the easiest, but I have such amazing family and friends that have supported me the whole way. Feeling proud of myself :)"
happy,"This is my life. I can't share this with anyone without coming off as boastful, but I just needed to put it into words. This is the story of my growth as a person through from being a kid to an adult through a year, from a single drunken realisation.

When I was a kid, I was, and still am, incredibly fortunate. I was born into a financially safe family with loving parents, a cool older brother. I was an athlete as a kid, smart, confident and socially liked. Kind, respectful, 'cool'. Mate's parents loved me, my friends thought I was the shit, everything was perfect. I got older, became a teenager. I had a big friend group, I was good with girls and good at the things I tried. I never tried in school and did well, and I started truly becoming a prick. I was so full of myself. I picked on anyone that was different to me to make my mates or girls laugh, I was crass and rude. I'd spend my life fucking around with my friends, not doing anything of value and arguing with people on the internet to get a rise out of them. I didn't appreciate my parents or my family, I'd show up late to important things and not bother going to things if I didn't absolutely have to. My mates started getting sick of me. My parents started getting sick of me. My brother started getting sick of me.

Then adulthood came. I was 18, I finished school with decent marks, got into a good degree at uni, and started completely letting everything go. For my entire life, everything had been done for me. I'd show up, do the bare minimum, and life started going downhill because of it. I got into a relationship with a girl and interjected myself in her life. I'd try and 'fix' things for her that didn't need fixing, and her resentment grew. She came from a rough house, wasn't mentally healthy and started taking it out on me, verbally and emotionally. My life caught up with me. I was turning in my assignments at the last possible moment, scrapping together the lowest amount of money possible to pay for alcohol, club tickets and petrol, I was putting up with emotional manipulation and hurtful insults from the girl I loved. I stopped going to the gym. I started smoking. I let myself go mentally and physically completely. I gained heaps of weight, picked up terrible habits with everything you can think of. I embraced the full on 'loser' lifestyle. I leeched off my family and made nothing of myself. Me and my ex broke up in a bad way, and I put up with the harassment for months afterwards.

I was a 'yeah I'll get around to it' type of person. I was gonna get my shit together, I was gonna get back to the gym, I was gonna work on myself EVENTUALLY. I was gonna get a tattoo, I was gonna finish uni, I was gonna get a 'real' job. Every day I'd lie to my friends, my family, but most importantly, myself. I'd lie that I was going to get things back on track and start living, but it never happened. I never started anything. I had my hand in a thousand things and the moment I wasn't immediately gratified with a reward, I quit. I was gonna make more friends and go travelling! I was going to get a high paying job with absolutely zero effort! I was so stuck in the mindset of everything being easy and done for me, that I just expected things to work out for me.

At the start of last year, I was a fraction of the human I am now. To cope with how 'hard' life was, I did everything dumb you can think of. I was a 20 year old bloke, depressed, selfish, leeching loser. All I did was party, chat up girls, eat like shit, drink too many beers and smoke too much bud, and ALWAYS fuck off any real work and ambition for a good night with my mates. I had zero self-control, zero idea, zero moderation and idea of where I was going and what I was capable of. No life skills. For Christ's sake, I could barely do my own laundry. My Mum had taken care of almost every tiny aspect of my life and I'd never even appreciated her for it. I remember going to my ex's and barely knowing how to wash dishes because I was that useless in any real life skill. Everything was done for me.

Then things got rough. My dad's heart essentially gave out, my brother who had always been a stalwart, mature and driven bloke had a full blown mental health crisis due to some physical health issues, and my family collapsed. Dad was off work and Mum was taking care of him, my brother was bedridden and lower than any low I'd seen him overcome before. And there I was; sat in my room, taking my life for granted. I was playing games into the late hours, never doing my uni course work and working a casual, extremely low-hour and low paying job, not because I was busy, but because I was lazy and didn't want to face any real work. I'd rather just sit in my room and watch every youtube video and pump as many hours into games as I could, then the weekend would come and I'd be drunk/high for the entirety of it and make stupid self destructive choices. Never saved any money or did anything for anyone farther than what I had to do to consider myself a good person. I was seeing a girl I had no romantic interest in because I was bored, taking her kindness for granted. Absolute rock bottom. My mental illness was out the wazoo. Shit was absolutely brutal and was truly my lowest low.

Then, one day, I was over at a mate's and we were playing poker. I had a smoke in my mouth and 8 or 9 empty beer bottles next to my chair and a fresh one in my hand, hair greasy and out of sorts, basically had my pyjamas on, totally mashed. I looked over at a mate to make a stupid joke and caught a look at myself in the mirror. I was overweight, my skin was a mess, I was borderline unwashed and I absolutely HATED it. I realised in a fraction of a second that all the anger and hurt I was balling up in my stomach wasn't directed to anyone else. It wasn't the people who'd put me down, it wasn't my ex, it wasn't my loving family who I perceived as 'overbearing and annoying', it was me. I'd come from a life of such opportunity and I'd squandered all of it. My life was in shambles and it was MY fault. No one put a drink in my hand or a smoke in my mouth, no one put a gun to my head and stopped me studying and working on myself. I'd done it myself. I was a total dick to everyone around me, even catching the insult to my friend in my throat that wasn't funny in the slightest; just a knee jerk reaction to something he'd said. I was immature in every sense of the word, and I was completely wasting myself, my opportunities and my life.

In that moment, I was truly, truly disgusted with myself. I loathed the life I'd wasted, and then came to another instant realisation. That didn't have to continue. I didn't have to hate myself anymore. I'm young, there was still time to put things in the right place and get it done. I didn't have to keep up with my ex's instagram anymore, I didn't have to drink myself to death to have a good time. I didn't have to spend all of my free time outside of partying playing games and being bored. There was new things to try; a whole life yet lived.

Over the next month, I made changes. I put my study on hold, which was an incredibly hard thing to do. For the first time truly in my selfish life, I sacrificed my own movement forward to take care of the people around me. I got out there, picked up another job. I started trying. I started, very slowly, turning myself back into someone I once was, someone a young me could be proud of. Someone my parents could be proud of. Someone I could be proud of. I stopped drinking for an entire month, which I hadn't done since I'd turned 18. I completely put down the bong. I booked myself into a therapist and paid for it myself, not trying to wrangle money out of my parents to put money into self growth that would go to waste. I wrote down a list of my goals. I signed back up to the gym. I stopped chasing late nights and cheap relationships.

I slipped up at times. Made dumb decisions, I hurt people. But I stopped beating myself up for my own mistakes and trying to blame circumstance or other people. I started holding myself accountable. I started showing regret and appreciation a lot more, I stopped saying 'I'll get around to it'. I started doing.

I started taking care of my dad physically, my brother mentally and giving my Mum a break. I'd clean the house and do the shopping so she could come home from work and just be with my old man. I went outside and learned to properly mow, learned how to hedge, how to weed and lay gravel. I fixed stuff in our house by myself with no direction except for google, I learned how to be financially intelligent, I learned true independence from my family for the first time. I learned that I could laugh louder and bring smile to peoples faces, I learned that within me was the ability to do anything I could put my mind to. I learned that part of my happiness came from spreading joy to those around me and making people smile. I learned to put down the lying, scummy, self loathing part of myself again. The pessimist. I started appreciating the sun more, I started spending more time just helping! I started spending real time with my brother. We became mates again. I started coaching him through his breakdowns and holding him through his panic attacks. I started kissing my mum on the cheek again and bringing my parents a coffee in bed. I started laughing with my friends instead of at them. I started showing pride in my own actions, pride in other's actions. I complimented people's clothes and their laughs, shaking more hands, working harder. I started catching up on all the uni work I'd missed and getting up earlier. I started going for runs. I starting putting greenery on my plate. I started washing up the dishes more, watching movies with my dad when he was awake, or sitting with him while he was reading. I started hanging out with my Mum and treating her to coffee and lunch, getting her out of the house. I started driving my friends around while they drank and I just smiled and laughed and got on the AUX for them. I started writing music and stories again. I put more effort into DnD characters, I stopped being embarrassed about stupid things. I started SMILING. Really, actually, SMILING.

I was going out, and I was partying, but I was drinking within my wallet and I wasn't so miserable when I was mashed. I started dancing and walking girl's to their front doors instead of just dropping them off. I started connecting with the kids at work and I started babysitting my cousins. I went over to my grandparent's house and fixed their technology, spending time with them. I stopped trying to what I considered cool and just starting doing fun shit. I tried bouldering. I tried surfing. I tried playing club footy again. I started hanging out with new people, people completely different to me. I started learning. I started to feel passion for things again. I started training muay thai because I'd always said I would.

I started DOING.

Now, here I am, emotional late at night and just so fucking HAPPY. I'm single and so content with my life and so busy that I have no interest in being in a relationship, I am overwhelmed with pure joy and so truly happy with who I am. I've lost weight. I don't smoke or vape anymore. I'm excited to wake up and go to work and come home and give my mum a hug and hang out with her while she cooks dinner. My dad's back to almost full strength and he's his old happy self, my brother is medicated and learning to become himself again. I spend less time in my room. I spend less time existing and more time living. Me and my friends are even actually going travelling next year, because I'll be graduating! We're doing a roadtrip across America and I'm so excited. I'm going to have so much fun and meet so many new people. Then I'm gonna come home, continue the life I'll be putting on hold temporarily. I'm gonna get a decent job and do my best. 

There will be pitfalls, I'm going to have bad days and meet bad people, have bad experiences but I'm stronger now than I ever was before. I can cook for myself. I can clean for myself. I help out around the house. I show my love to people. I write my feelings down and create stories that I share with my friends. I found my passion for being alive again. I've become a rock for someone very close to me that I work with every day to get her life back on track.

Don't get me wrong, I haven't fixed everything in a year. I still struggle with staying ontop of my newfound responsibilities and sometimes I'm lazy and sometimes I make dumb decisions, but I am leaps and bounds ahead of where I was. I am always trying to improve, and I can only go up from here.

One day, I'm going to be even happier than I am now. I'm gonna have a wife and kids that I can support through anything they go through, and I'm going to be a fuckin' great dad and dude in general. God fucking damn. I am absolutely ecstatic to be alive.

Life's good in the sunshine.

I had someone end up DMing me about this post talking about their own alcohol and nicotine intake and I just wanted to throw this on the end; there's nothing wrong with partying and having fun. I still go out and get pissed and what not, but the way I was doing it at the start of last year was simply as a coping mechanism. I was completely out of moderation and completely out of my head, and I was way overdoing it. There's nothing lame about getting drunk and having a good time, as long as you're doing so healthily and being safe! Everything in moderation."
happy,"I never thought giving a gift would make me so happy. I live in India and my best friend always had this big desire to visit a special place for worshipping Krishna. Unfortunately, that place is very far away. But then I found out there is a similar place much closer to where we live, so I decided to take her there as a surprise.

I didn't tell her where I intended to take her. I just asked her when she had her holidays and around christmas we planned the trip. It took 4 hours to reach there and when we were just about to reach I gave her a note saying 'We will visit your favourite place one day soon. Until that time enjoy this little surprise from me'. When we were at front gate and she realized where we were she became so mesmerised. Seeing her so happy I felt very gratified. That was the first time I realized that love is about giving cause the more you give the more blissful you become.

We visited every temple, the people were chanting Hare Krishna and she was enjoying every little thing. She even took some of the soil from there as a memory. Seeing that she loved my surprise there was different level of joy within me and I truly felt what Sadhguru says 'How deeply you touch another life is how rich your life is'."
happy,"recently, life has been busy so i've started to put my phone aside other than for an hour, and honestly it has made all the difference. there are so many unnecessary things we think about when scrolling endlessly on social media , highly recommend putting your phone in another room, so that you feel a weight lifted off your shoulders!"
happy,Sorry the picture is lame
happy,"Hey all, today I woke up and stepped on a weight scale and saw it was 158.5lbs :) I was around 202lbs when I started and it's amazing I reached into the 150 range, the last recorded weight of me I can remember was being around 160 a couple years back and it has only gone up since then. The fact I'm lower than that makes me extremely proud of myself and that change really is possible! 

It really helps I also have my boyfriend supporting me and he's one of my main motivators, he helps me feel secure and safe :D

There were times I ""failed"" and felt terrible about myself that I didn't keep myself in check, then I always tell myself, ""it's a marathon, not a race"" and that along the way you will have difficulties snacking, plateaus, and others where you just go beyond your calories for the day. But also, times where you'll do it and be succcessful. In the end they all add up and you will see that no matter what, that you DID lose weight because you didn't give up regardless of all the missteps. The smallest steps are my favorite, esp at the beginning! Because something is working. The scale isn't always accurate and fluctuates, so I take pictures and the differenc is very noticable :)

Super proud of myself, and thankful to my boyfriend in this journey."
happy,"I started an automotive apparel and parts brand back in 2012 as a “hobby”, just wanting to make some cool stuff for friends. A few years in, I took it on full time and I’ve been doing that ever since. It’s a lot of long days and sleepless nights but I finally achieved a goal I’ve been wanting since the beginning.

After years and years of hard work we got picked up by Zumiez 🥹🏁"
happy,Today is day 1 of no contact after being married to a narcissist for 8 years this is the hardest thing I have ever done in my life I’ve lived through the abuse the torture the cheating the lies and yet I miss them but today I started making a list every time I want to call them I add to that list a reminder of all the things my brain made me forget all these years I am hoping this is day 1 of a life without being controlled 
happy,"There used to be a falling down house across the street from me. Some realtor picked it up on a property tax sale and tore it down. Should have been no big deal and just a normal tear down and rebuild, right? Along the way, I noticed it was taking forever to build 2 homes they decided to build on the lot. It's been almost 2 years since construction started, 1 house is complete, the 2nd is about half finished. I'm home with a work injury, so there isn't much else to watch but this build and the boob tube. And of course, my dogs go berserk whenever people show up over there.

Dogs are going off one day and I look to see what set them off. It's a mold abatement company. I didn't really think too much of it, and a year passed before the house was complete. My friend tells me after she has signed the contract that she's moving across the street from me. That's when the alarm bells went off in my head. I let her know to be thorough in her inspection because they'd already treated this brand-new home for mold. Her jaw hits the floor, and she says that the owner/realtor (both are the same person) didn't disclose that.

There are other problems, like none of the dirt from digging in water lines, nor any gravel in preparation for driveways and sidewalks being compacted. None of the cement has rebar to reinforce and strengthen it to stand up to our winters. The un-compacted water line trenches run under both driveways. I guess hauling off piles of dirt wasn't a clue to the builder that it might be a problem later.

Final inspection day comes, and it takes 2 pry bars operated by 2 fairly large men to get the access to the crawl space open because it's so wet in the crawl space it has made the wood swell quite a bit. Not only is the crawlspace infested with mold, but against code, the crawl space wasn't built with any ventilation. So my friend got out of the contract, and the owner/realtor will likely lose her real estate license for not making proper disclosures.

Yes, it sucks that she has to look for another house, but she's so happy she didn't get stuck in a mold infested trap. And funnily enough, you can hear fans running from over there 24/7 in both houses."
happy,"We found out she had uterine cancer last week, and they scheduled her for a hysterectomy immediately. She had surgery this morning, and it went great. Minimum blood loss, no sign of cancer. I'm so relieved I can't even tell you. Best day of my life."
happy,"We are both in our second year of high school and she sent me this

It bloomed I'm so happy ☺️"
happy,Cancer free
happy,"Growing up I was always in special education classes and have a real hard time learning. I was addicted to meth for 16 years and have been sober for 14. I started working at a treatment center in the kitchen, and never thought that I would ever have my own office able to help people struggling with substances. The thought of passing this test was so far-fetched. Anyway, on the 31st I passed my test and feel about 2 inches taller. And for somebody of my stature that’s a big deal lol I have been happy dancing all week. Now I have a career that I can provide for my 15-year-old son. Which I got full custody of when I was five years sober. Life is so good. If you’re struggling but doing the right thing, keep it up it pays off."
happy,I am in 9th grade and I was just going through so kinda rough times my ex was spreading rumors and her friend (a boy) wanted to jump me with a group of friends and it finally stopped. I had a track meet today and I couldn't run in the meet because I got injured in gym class (sprained knee). So I was taking times for all the running events and this one girl (senior) did a really good job on hurdles. When I got in the car the first thing I did was add her on snap to give her congrats on doing so well and it turned into us getting to know each other and then I asked her if being an adult is hard and she told me it wasent and reassured me it's actually fun because you can drive and get more jobs. We ended up talking about our plans for out of high school. This girl helped my fears of adulthood and actually made me exited for it.
happy,"Hi, Everyone.

I was going to wait a week, but I had to create an account and post this because I’m just too happy to keep it inside anymore.

A few days ago, my wife posted on this board. She was having a tough time sleeping, and in the middle of this rough night, the thought of something I did brought a smile to her face. She shared that moment with everyone here, and in response, the amount of goodwill and kindness that flowed from this community was overwhelming. 

She kept this post secret from me—never expecting it to make other than a few people smile. Little did she know, it would gain a ton of traction. The generosity and support that followed made it tough for her to conceal, and eventually, she showed me the thought that made her so happy this past Monday at 3 A.M..

My wife is amazing. I’m so happy, lucky, and fortunate to be in that group of people who have truly found their soulmate. My heart becomes full just thinking about her, and sometimes I just say her name randomly because it makes me happy to hear. I love her so much, and I can’t stop smiling right now.

I also want to take a moment to thank everyone in this community. What you all did truly shows the amazing types of people you are. From the messages of encouragement, to the acts of support, it’s a been such a joy. I’ll never forget any of it, and when I called my mother to tell her about what everyone here did, it seriously made her day.

Thank you all so much. You made my wife happy. You made my mom happy. For that, I will forever be grateful, and I promise to do my best to spread all the positive energy you gave us back out into the world.

This truly is the bright center of the Internet."
happy,"Hope my cat can brighten your day

My cat always brightens my day every day she brings a smile to my face , every day she brings a smile to my face

I hope this nice picture of her can also brighten your day. She is such a loving cat.

Hope you have all had a great day"
happy,"I’ve been in for four years, four years since I was seventeen. It’s been an experience and I’m so glad that I can go back home and see my family, my friends, travel more freely, attend university. I’ve never been more satisfied with my position now that this chapter of my life is finally coming to a close."
happy,"(Just to preface this, it happened yesterday, and I wrote it yesterday, so it’s in present tense, but happened yesterday)

So I have a lot of very noticeable self harm scars on my legs. Especially my right thigh. They’re basically all over, and pretty close to my knees. If I wear shorts, they’re extremely visible. Today, it was 85 degrees, and I also am in track and field.

I was super super nervous about wearing shorts to school today, because it’d really be the first time anyone would have seen my scars, and I was just freaking out. The day had gone pretty good, 2 girls asked me what happened to my leg, I just said “it’s not important” and they left it at that.

Then, at the end of track practice, a guy a couple grades older than me comes up to me, and says “hey, amazing-flute-piano, are those scars?” As he gestures towards his own leg. Internally, I’m dying. Like I’m soooo nervous for what he’s about to say.

I just say “yea, they are”. Then he says “I think you’re so incredibly brave for wearing shorts. That takes a lot of courage.” And I just thanked him.

I also smiled. I did more than smile. I cried. I started crying from the sheer gratefulness and gratitude I felt. I started crying because I never expected those words to come out of anyone’s mouth, let alone another high schoolers. I started crying because that meant so much to me. It made me feel so happy. It truly did. It made me feel like I wasn’t alone, and that not everyone will judge me. It made me feel proud, and not ashamed.

Tomorrow, I have a class with him, and I’m going to make sure that I thank him again, because he deserves it. 🤍"
happy," 

On Feb 15th I was 214 pounds . Went on a low calorie diet and eating only once or twice a day of lean chicken and 3 veggies and only drinking water/water with no sugar flavoring. 40 minutes at 3mph daily on the treadmill and 20 minutes daily of benchpresses and curls . Today I'm at 198 !!!!!!! Still got a ways to go my goal is 180 but getting there!!!!

I'm excited."

happy,"We've only been dating for a few weeks now, but she is incredibly thoughtful--she made soup and dropped it off for me when I got covid over the holidays, we've made each other playlists and I am enthralled by the one she made me, she sends me really sweet voice messages when she wakes up and before she goes to bed, she says incredibly sweet, silly, and romantic things that make me blush for days at a time. I have never felt so safe and held and seen and attracted to someone all at once so quickly before. She is really forthright and curious and has a lot of integrity. I admire her a great deal and feel so lucky to be able to see who she is becoming (she is trans and has been honoring herself in some pretty big ways lately and witnessing that from the sidelines has been really beautiful and touching). I am not sure how long we'll be together but for now I am very grateful she is in my life. "
happy,"It feels so euphorically good to be in love with my best friend. Have I laughed? Constantly, daily, hourly. Have I cried? Yes, tears of joy. We play video games, sometimes I watch him play, sometimes he watches me, but when we play together we always have each others backs! We go on long walks, at night, with our dog, to the beach, to different cities or exploring shops and attractions. We leave each other love notes, poetry, words of encouragement. We workout and hold each other accountable, cook meals together. We love each other’s families and feel comfortable and accepted. We have spa days together, face masks, bubble bath, scrubs, moisturizer and massages. When either of us feels sad we listen with true understanding and openness, thoughtful advice and write out plans to strengthen our resolve. We dance together, in our home, in the grocery store, with our dog or anywhere we feel like. I’ve never been so in love, at peace, accepted,  empowered and confident. I am finally happy. "

happy,"I just started a new job 3 weeks ago. On the first day of training there were 2 other people in a group with me. We instantly clicked and have been having lunch together and texting each other everyday since. 

We each are going through breakups and while at different stages of healing, they are just so positive and supportive. It’s been really good for me. They are also both super healthy and workout regularly which is really impressive to me and has motivated me to get off my ass! lol  We even signed up for a hot yoga class this weekend! 🧘‍♀️

We were all texting last night saying how we felt we were supposed to meet one another. Just makes me feel grateful for being able to meet new friends at 43 and especially at a time when my heart is missing who I thought was my person so much.

happy,"I was a mess for two decades, booze, coke, just whatever. I have now made it two years without a drink or any coke. I'm so happy right now.

happy,"My son loves to play outside. The house next to us is being rebuilt so it is unoccupied at the moment. There is a small pond located on the property so every now and then we venture over there to see what sort of wildlife we can spot. Yesterday, disappointment struck when we arrived to the pond and didn’t spot any animals. Normally there’s at least a few ducks, but not today. After about 10 minutes he looked down at the ground, picked up a very high-quality stick, and threw it into the water. The stick struck the water. The splash made him so happy he exclaimed, “I did it dada, I did it.” It took me a second but then I realized, wow he is so happy because of the stick hitting the water! Mind you, I have never thrown anything into this pond before, so this was just his primal instinct telling him “pick up stick, throw stick water, stick make splash, make boy happy”… anyways I thought I’d share this because it was enough to make a grown-man cry. Such simple acts can bring so much joy. We’re such simple creatures haha. Have a great day everyone

happy,"“How is her brother doing?”

Weird, right? Ill make it make sense!

My best friend passed away 2 years ago, we have guardianship of her 17f daughter, and are active in her 18transM’s son’s life. We’ll call him K.

I have boomer parents. I would gently correct them when they referred to the kids as “the girls,” or used the incorrect pronouns for K. I was understanding that they were going to mess up here and there because of the generational gap, but figured after consistent gentle corrections, they would get there sooner than later.

I was wrong. After nearly 2 years, I felt I gave them more than enough grace to get it right. My mom has been the main culprit of the two because she always wants to talk about the kids, while my dad never really asked/talked about them as often (man of few words type). I started getting more aggravated and upset every time my mom would ask “how are the girls doing?” After 2 years, I just felt like my parents just didn’t care enough to even try to understand. I stopped bringing the kids around my family because I felt like it was always a negative experience for them, and refused to subject them to that kind of environment.

Fast forward to last week: I was talking to my dad on the phone. He was asking about 17f because I had mentioned she was starting school again soon and she just had a birthday. After we were done talking about her, he said the sentence:

“How is her brother doing?”

0 coaching. No correcting. Just him using his own words. 

I couldn’t believe it and actually stuttered a bit after that one sentence. That was the first time I heard one of my parents affirm his gender identity. 

My dad does care and has been listening. My heart exploded. I had hella tears.

I love my dad and am happy."
happy,"I just got back from a trip to Idaho for my nieces high school graduation. I had casually kept a good relationship over text with my niece ever since she moved from Southern California to Texas to Idaho in less than a few months. I knew she was going through a lot emotionally and with college coming up it was stressful. I remember how I was at that age (I graduated 2003 and also switched high schools my sr year).

Come graduation day we're in the gymnasium and all the families are still kinda getting seated. I can see all the chairs for the seniors to sit on, I see all the administration on stage and the band in the back playing some songs. Then I see some of her family on her moms side get super excited and I look down to my right to see what the commotion's about. It's a sash that said ""Valedictorian"".

What?! Not only was my niece Valedictorian of her class, she absolutely CRUSHED it. She's already a full year ahead into her college coursework, passed every AP exam she took, played Bass Clarinet through school, did Softball and went to State Championships. She's like a superhuman.

I don't have any kids of my own, but the amount of pride I feel for her is immense. To top it all off she got a full ride to the University of Idaho and she plans on studying Neuroscience (you know, easy stuff). And she's still highly critical of herself and self analyses a ton looking for any way to be better in almost anything she does. The coolest thing I ever did was play video games professionally on a stage - this girl's about to solve complex brain problems as a hobby.

As a reward for all her hard work I made her a promise - a thing I never do because I hate making promises as I hate even the idea of not being able to keep one. I promised her if she graduated with a 4 year degree (not even necessarily in neuroscience, I gave her that leeway) that I'd personally pay for and accompany her on a trip to Japan. And since she's worked so hard in high school she's already got a year head start. I now have 3 years to save up for a Japan trip. Worst Best promise ever."

happy,"I have two beautiful kids that I love dearly and they are both my bonus children. My husband made an appointment for tomorrow to start the ball rolling on reversing his vasectomy. 

When we met he told me he didn’t really believe in marriage and he already had his children. I said I was fine with that, and I was. But time has passed and we’ve moved together and grown together. He tells me I’m the best mother he’s ever seen, that I deserve my own and that he desperately wants it too. Our kids ask us constantly when we’re going to have a baby. Hopefully we can answer that soon. 

Send us some baby dust on this Valentine’s Day. 🫶🏼"
happy,"I've struggled in the dating arena for years, only managing to get one or two first dates, from the apps. Last year, I realized I was asexual, and tried a dating site for asexuals. I started chatting with someone on there, and just met in person, and we really hit it off. "
happy,"Getting groceries with my(31) wife(29) and our 3 month old baby yesterday, I saw a kid standing in the middle of the aisle blocking someone trying to get their cart through. He turned and noticed them, stepped to the side and said ""oh excuse me!"". The parent around our age said ""good job (kids name) that was very polite!"". He said ""thanks, we have to think about other people too right?"", to which she replied ""that's exactly right"" and gave him a firm one arm hug.

Thinking about that this morning, it makes me so happy to see people teaching compassion and thoughtfulness nowadays. She seemed to be very involved as a parent, and I can't wait to be/teach that way for our daughter. Idk why but that thought is hitting that happy cord so hard today, just felt like sharing!"

happy,"I start my first job tomorrow!

I’m a new grad nurse currently in the Philippines, and after passing the board exam, I contacted my review center and expressed my interest in lecturing to help teach others how to pass their licensure exam.

I’m starting tomorrow and it feels like a dream came true that I didn’t even know I had. I love helping people, it’s part of why I got into nursing in the first place, and the knowledge that I can have even a small part in helping others getting to that point makes me truly happy.

The company is very easy to communicate with, I respect the hell out of my seniors, I’ll travel around the country to lecture at the other centers, and I’ll be able to use this opportunity to also help prepare myself for eventually taking the US NCLEX as well.

This year hasn’t started out great, but this is a giant W to get my mood up, and I am so greatful for the opportunity and experience."

It wasn’t specific or anything but we both just stopped reaching out and got busy . 


Well yesterday after like 2 days of no contact , I go to message him on instagram and the second my message delivered, I received a message from him on text message 😂 

We literally messaged each other at the exact same moment after 2 days and were thinking of each other exactly at the same moment 

So adorable haha "
happy,"2 years ago, when I told my family and friends I wanted to release all original music as a fully independent artist, and try to turn it into a full time living, almost everyone I knew didn’t believe I’d get very far… I know realistically the vast majority of people that try don’t get far, so I could understand where they were coming from (the music industry is insanely hard to make a living in). But I would never know if I didn’t try…So I did. And I worked so hard, and so many times I asked myself why I was doing this…So many times I wanted to give up. But looking at this milestone, I feel very happy and proud that I didn’t give up. I’m also earning a decent part time income from my music too! The next goal is full time! Just thought I’d share this, and to not give up on your dreams if you truly love doing them! :)

happy,"I've been sad for nearly 2 years after my best friend completely moved on from me after 13 years. I'm not longer angry or sad about it. 

I can't change it. She's happy now, and that's all I wish for her. I'm at peace with the whole situation at last. I'm happy knowing she's happy, and that we can still be friends, even if we're not as close. 

I think of our memories fondly, and not in sadness. And I feel so much more free, it's always been in the back of my mind since it happened, and when I first thought of her today I just felt alright. Life will do what it will. I absolutely can't wait to make new friends"
happy,"My boyfriend and I were cuddling yesterday and he told me he wants to be the father of my kids one day. I’ve always wanted a loving and respectful man who would want something long-term with me and I also aspire to be a mother who raises a cute lil family of my own one day, so I was squealing on the inside when he told me this :) I hope everyone and anyone can experience love as amazing as this if not better 🥰"

I was going back in all the stuff I had and all the games I was playing, but something I saw in particular made me cry tears of joy. My mom sent me messages in my iPad with pictures of her with my childhood toy with her at work, in the bed while she was sleeping, and sent me some texts wishing me the best, say8ng she loves me, and other stuff. I was crying tears of joy."
happy,"Been talking to this girl for a actually not that long just two or thre months, has not been the best start but currently it's been working really well actually. got to hang out and yeah she's starting to text me on her own whenever we didn't text much throughout the day, asking me how my day has been. Seems stupid but it really means alot to me because i have had a really  exhausting  time with relationships and had little to no female friends and never talking to anyone or socializing for days and feeling left alone and it's been a while since my last relationship that was more than just sleeping together. I mean intimicay doesn't do much for me if i don't feel emotionally connected. Nothing made me happier recently than when she texts me and asks how my day was or when we just talk about Mutual interests and shit. Life has been really good recently."

I've been severely depressed since I was young, a lot of people told me to ""die"", or that ""I definitely wouldn't make it to adulthood"" (guess what, bitches). Eighteen years old is like a baby that can vote, I have a lot to figure out. I'm just beginning life.

I know that to most people this doesn't seem like much, but as someone who has attempted in the past this is MASSIVE for me and I cried after just thinking about it.

happy,"Hi, Everyone.

I was going to wait a week, but I had to create an account and post this because I’m just too happy to keep it inside anymore.

A few days ago, my wife posted on this board. She was having a tough time sleeping, and in the middle of this rough night, the thought of something I did brought a smile to her face. She shared that moment with everyone here, and in response, the amount of goodwill and kindness that flowed from this community was overwhelming. 

She kept this post secret from me—never expecting it to make other than a few people smile. Little did she know, it would gain a ton of traction. The generosity and support that followed made it tough for her to conceal, and eventually, she showed me the thought that made her so happy this past Monday at 3 A.M..

My wife is amazing. I’m so happy, lucky, and fortunate to be in that group of people who have truly found their soulmate. My heart becomes full just thinking about her, and sometimes I just say her name randomly because it makes me happy to hear. I love her so much, and I can’t stop smiling right now.

I also want to take a moment to thank everyone in this community. What you all did truly shows the amazing types of people you are. From the messages of encouragement, to the acts of support, it’s a been such a joy. I’ll never forget any of it, and when I called my mother to tell her about what everyone here did, it seriously made her day.

Thank you all so much. You made my wife happy. You made my mom happy. For that, I will forever be grateful, and I promise to do my best to spread all the positive energy you gave us back out into the world.

This truly is the bright center of the Internet."

🐾 Walking across the carpark saw a man walking his tiny dachsund puppy, he stepped off the curb but had to stop and look back cos the puppy had sat down on the edge of the curb. So the guy went back and picked him up and put him on the road and then the puppy walked after him with a big waggy tail.

The step off the curb was too high!! 🥹

🎈3 hot air balloons coming into land nearby. I saw about 5 in the sky but there were 3 landing in a park along the trainline. They're huge! I've never seen that before!! It was very exciting for me!!

Kinda made my day. No photos, but it all happened. Just wanted to share my feelings of joy. 😊

Have a good day!!!"

My professor had embarrassed me in front of the whole class because I did not know one answer. He started asking me my name and throwing comments about how I don't know anything and all. He made me stand in front of everyone. Nevertheless, I, someone who's suffering from anxiety disorder and severe anxiety, someone who gets embarrassed so very easily, for the first time, did not get embarrassed. 

I was pretty chill tbh. I did not have a raised heartbeat, I did not feel extremely sad, I did not panic, I might have had a few tics but that's it. After he left, I just went about doing my job and honestly I was impressed with myself. Idk whether this happended because I have a bigger embarrassing situation/trauma to deal with such that this felt so small or because I was already tired of everyone's sh!t. 

It happened and I'm honestly kinda happy."

happy,"Hey all, today I woke up and stepped on a weight scale and saw it was 158.5lbs :) I was around 202lbs when I started and it's amazing I reached into the 150 range, the last recorded weight of me I can remember was being around 160 a couple years back and it has only gone up since then. The fact I'm lower than that makes me extremely proud of myself and that change really is possible! 

It really helps I also have my boyfriend supporting me and he's one of my main motivators, he helps me feel secure and safe :D

There were times I ""failed"" and felt terrible about myself that I didn't keep myself in check, then I always tell myself, ""it's a marathon, not a race"" and that along the way you will have difficulties snacking, plateaus, and others where you just go beyond your calories for the day. But also, times where you'll do it and be succcessful. In the end they all add up and you will see that no matter what, that you DID lose weight because you didn't give up regardless of all the missteps. The smallest steps are my favorite, esp at the beginning! Because something is working. The scale isn't always accurate and fluctuates, so I take pictures and the differenc is very noticable :)

Super proud of myself, and thankful to my boyfriend in this journey."
happy,"Hey all! I've been on the weightloss train for nearly 3-4 years now! I am only 5',3"", so at my biggest of 215lbs, I was quite heavy for my size. 
I began to simply just eat less, take in less sugar, reduce my portions, and begin walking (10k steps a day). 
Towards the end of my journey I began running and working out as well, which helped me over come plateaus, as well as reducing sugar to nearly 0. 
I am now 120lbs. I may lose 5 more pounds to be 115lbs, but we'll see. It took me nearly half a decade, but I can rest now knowing it is finally accomplished! "
happy,"I love being able to form an environment where people feel safe and comfortable around me. I love listening to people's needs and giving them a safe enough space to express those needs and trust that I won't belittle them for it. 

I just saw a post about this guy who kept getting sick and was worried his girlfriend and sister were poisoning him, and I thought about how me and my girlfriends cook for one another all the time. I get that it's the most basic and normal ass thing to trust someone to cook for you. People in restaurants trust complete strangers to cook for them all the time. But it's kinda sweet when you think about it, that someone you know a lot about and loves you trusts you unsupervised to prepare a substance to put in their body. It's neat. 

Not to mention trusting me not to hurt them too bad when we bring knifeplay into the bedroom (WHICH IS A MUCH BIGGER FORM OF TRUST I KNOW) or trusting me to tie them up or to touch their naked bodies. Ugh, I did that. I fosterd a loving relationship enough times over and over that another person (two people!) will let me have my hands on them in one of their most vulnerable moments. 

And people trusting me to prepare drugs for them. I've had people leave it in my hands, again unsupervised, to measure and dose their first experience with psychedelics. It's an honor, really, to be a good enough person that someone else (who at the time had never met me in real life!) finally met me, and felt comfortable enough to trust me to properly drug them for a good experience. It's sweet. It makes me feel good. I like when people are comfortable around me, and I don't understand how other people enjoy (or at least act like they enjoy) the opposite. "

I had a low interest rate, but I wanted to pay off my home loan since retirement is not too far away. I have a few more years to top off my savings then I can pull the plug on my career.

happy,"So, my brother and I were walking to the store just to pick up some stuff. We got in and I went to the drinks section, to get a flavoured water. Some kid who looked a little older than us was half-way blocking the drink I needed to get (I don't care, I'm really patient), and when he noticed, immediately apologized and moved. I felt bad, I said ""no, it's alright!"", and he mumbled something inaudible to me afterwards, but smiled, so did I. 

My brother and I got our items, and were waiting in line. It was just the guy from the drinks section in front of us. He payed for his stuff, then handed a 10 dollar bill to the worker, and said, ""That's to pay for them"", pointing to us, whilst exiting the store. We thanked him, and he said ""You guys are nice"", and he was out of the store. It all happened really fast, but it paid for our stuff. We left and his dad or someone was already driving away. He waved, and we did too. It was just really sweet I thought. I hadn't had that happened to me before."

I couldn’t have forgiven myself for never atleast trying it and I guess now I can say I did. If anyone ever sees this whatever you are afraid to do, please don’t be and just do it. Do what you love because that’s what matters.

happy,"23 Male and going through a Major Depression to the point I rarely get out of my bed unless I have to go to my shitty job.

I was just endlessly scrolling when I got a call from an old highschool friend of mine. What's funny is that I've always wanted to contact my old highschool friends but insecurities and self doubt always gets the better of me.

He called me to ask how I was doing, and of course I lied and said I was doing OK. He said he was doing fine too and we talked for a bit. And he also asked that we should hang out sometime, and said sure. 

I know it might seem sad and pathetic to be happy over a call but that made me feel good."
happy,"Around November of last year I (26F) matched with this guy(26M), he's honestly one of the sweetest guys I've met on a dating app. We were talking for a whole, but had to go out seprate ways, because he was unemployed then and looking for a job and had other things going on in his life. He felt like he couldn't give me time. Which was totally ok and understable. 

Anyway in one of our conversation where he was stressed about not getting a job, I remember giving him a pep talk, and he told me then that when he gets a job I'll be one of the first few people he'll tell. 

It's been around two months since we stopped talking and he texted me today that he got a hired! I'm also suprised that he remembered and texted me about his job. I'm so happy for him. In suprising turn off events in currently unemployed after leaving a toxic workspace and seeing him get a job, made me feel not so bad about my own unemployment. So to whoever is in the same boat. We got this! We'll get a good job that will make us happy."

I used to bite them a lot when I was nervous, after panic attacks or after breakdowns, but for the last two weeks I haven’t had any urges to! My nails are finally long enough that I can paint them and they’re also the longest they’ve been in years! 

They might not be super long but to me they are! I’m hoping to let them grow longer and learn to do more nail art and stuff with them!"
happy,I’m so happy with myself
happy,"
Started a new job in February and became fast friends with Amanda. Her friendship means the world to me. Even though she is 18 years younger than me. We just love being friends. Yesterday we got our nails done and had dinner and drinks. 
I laughed so much my cheeks hurt. ☺️😊
We even got drinks that look like us 😂🤣"
happy,"Hi everyone. Sorry that this is quite long...I had this experience in December and typed out how I felt, but I never got around to posting it. I wanted to share what happened so I’m just putting this into the aether.

What is your personal background music to make a mundane action become an epic tale to overcome your own daily anxiety of existing? I had 2 upbeat songs that lightened up my soul (like “Hey, Soul Sister” and “Get Back” by THE one the THE only Luda!), and then 1 slow song to root me back down (I had the Mr.Kitty song “After Dark”), followed by another BANGER alert “Paint the Town Red” by Doja Cat... straight banger…anyways...and then something simply great. The first four weren’t necessarily in that order, but this song was last. The soul lifter “Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros - Home”.

The mundane actions of vacuuming, cleaning, organizing, doing the dishes, emptying the cat bin, etc., all became the act of a Hero overcoming adversity. Showing that even those that only managed to shower today are at times doing their best…you even completing one of the many tasks that need to be done is inspirational and shows you are still pushing.

I must say though that I just chose my playlist of liked videos and put it on shuffle so these are songs I already liked but they made the day feel so much more personal because I connected them to being the best version of myself in that moment. I felt in sync with myself. I felt…happy.

I belted “HEY SOUL SISTA!” at the top of my lungs for my friends. I did some shit talk dancing while listening to motha’ fuckin Luda! I did some sensual hip wiggles while listening to “After Dark."" I felt so sassy during Doja...wagging my finger back and forth and bobbing my head.

I was even happier knowing that Amanda was out looking for a Christmas tree. I was listening to “Home” again when I thought that…what a beautiful song. We are moving forward in our lives and it's spectacular. We get to put ornaments and our tree topper up soon! The tree topper we use is my Beanie Baby Creepers. I got him when I was young and I started putting him up there in my early 20’s so it just kind of continued on.

Moving on though! Amazingly, I pushed myself further and completed the next mundane task…I ate food. That’s impressive if I must say so myself. Maybe not to some…but I did it. I deserve to eat. And right now I think THAT is impressive too. :)

I hope this makes sense... It felt like such a beautiful out of body moment for me and I want others to try to experience that perspective of just being themselves and that doing simple things is in of itself beautiful. If the simple things are hard at this point in time for you, please keep telling yourself that you can do hard things."
happy,"A day ago I posted about how happy and excited I was that I made a plan to visit my boyfriend suddenly! And he was surprised a lot! But today he surprised me back by proposing me 😅🥺 So apparently he had plans to propose me before but the ring wasn’t delivered on time , so he was planning to propose me later this month. But since I visited him suddenly, he took this opportunity to surprise me back by taking out the ring at this magical hike we had today. This is probably the best thing ever happened to me, the uno reverse we all need in life ! 😭🤍✌️"
happy,"Just wanted to share this small victory, since im feeling hella good abt it.  
I tried to filter a dataframe for certain items, but it always gave me the code ""undefined columns selected"". I couldn´t solve it for literal DAYS and it really frustrated me to the point of crying.

  
Turns out i just forgot that the items had a headline in the program! So no wonder i defined them wrongly! I forgot that i didn´t turn off the headline while importing the dataset, and that´s why it always gave me that error!

  
I know i´m not a genius, but i feel absolutely undefeatable right now.

Thanks for reading my small vent :)"
happy,"Edgar (the raven) and Wartholomew (the frog) are Halloween decorations that I've had for a long while and dress in different costumes throughout the year (ex. holidays). They sit in our living room window facing the street.

I've had Edgar since 2020 & Wart since Summer 2023. I dress them in pet costumes (usually for cats or smaller pets like rodents/lizards) since they normally fit the best. 😀

Hope you guys like this! 😊"
happy,"Pretty rainy today but that ain't stopping me! Walked the same distance as yesterday but I'll try another mile in a week or so! I appreciate the support of making this a daily thing and i also appreciate all of you who have ""joined"" me in my walking! Love y'all and I'll see you tomorrow!"
happy,"I haven't had sushi in about 3-4 weeks. That changed when my parents surprised me with sushi! I was in the middle of an online class when my mom walked in (I had the camera and microphone turned off) and gave me two pieces of sushi. When I took the first bite of that first piece of sushi, it REALLY hit the spot. It just felt soooo satisfying and soooo delicious when I took that first bite. When I took that first bite, I felt that amazing feeling when you taste sushi for the first time and end up loving it so much that it becomes your favorite food. I've never felt this satisfaction and fulfillment like any other when satisfying a sushi craving like this particular moment.

I'm pretty sure that this is what a foodgasm feels like, cause I don't think I've ever felt this before when eating food, let alone trying certain foods for the first time.

I don't know if there are any more words I could use to describe this feeling."
happy,"Grew up in a small poor town in rural midwest. First of my family to go to college. I did two years of community college first while working at the mall and lived with parents, then I transferred to University and I only needed a loan for my final semester. That was in 2012. Not gonna lie, I was pretty much couch surfing/homeless til 2014 where I decided to learn programming (my major in college was history, what a waste of time).

Got my big break in 2015, but still living on the edge and needed roommates until 2019. In 2022 I joined a tech startup which I am still working at. I have zero debt outside of a mortgage (got a house at 3% in 2022 whew!), and have savings of a bit over $500k thanks to some smart investing. I got married in 2019 and have a daughter, and life is pretty good as I get to work from home and my wife doesn't have to work. My hours are flexible at work as well as long as I get my tasks done, that's all they care about. No set hours.

After expenses we have about $3k left over every month to invest or do something fun with.

I am pretty happy. Hopefully it lasts."

happy,"
As Violet's third birthday draws near, just two days away, I find myself overwhelmed with a sea of emotions. It's astonishing to think that my little girl is turning three, and at twenty, I've already spent these transformative years as her father. Time has sped by, filled with both challenges and incredible rewards.

Discovering I would become a father at seventeen was a shock. A mix of fear, uncertainty, excitement, and a heavy sense of responsibility hit me all at once. The day Violet arrived, holding her tiny, delicate body in my arms, I was struck with awe. Her blue eyes looked up at me, her dark brown hair perfectly framing her face. At that moment, I vowed to myself and to her that I would do everything possible to give her a joyful, safe, and fulfilling childhood.

Being thrust into fatherhood at such a young age forced me to mature quickly. Balancing school, work, and parenting felt like a high-wire act. Sleepless nights, early mornings, and countless moments of self-doubt were my new normal. But each time I saw Violet's smile or heard her giggle, I remembered why I was doing this. She was my drive, my reason to keep moving forward.

Violet is more than my daughter; she is my greatest inspiration and teacher. Even as a toddler, her intelligence and creativity continually amaze me. Her boundless imagination and inquisitive mind remind me of the wonder and beauty in the world. I strive to nurture her curiosity and ensure she always retains a sense of wonder. Her strength and resilience reflect my own, and together, we tackle life's challenges.

My primary goal has always been to create a stable and nurturing environment for Violet. I work full-time, saving diligently so I can provide a place where she has her own room—a space for her personality to blossom and her dreams to grow. This journey to success is demanding, but each step is fueled by my desire to give Violet the best start in life. I want her to believe she can achieve anything, and I am committed to being the role model she needs.

Navigating shared custody with Violet's mother has been a significant learning curve. Though we were never together, we both prioritize giving Violet a loving and supportive environment. Effective co-parenting requires clear communication, compromise, and a shared understanding of our roles in Violet's life. Despite the difficulties, we've managed to establish a balanced routine for her, ensuring she feels loved and supported by both parents.

With her third birthday approaching, my heart swells with gratitude and pride. Violet has changed my life in ways I never imagined, and I cherish every moment we share. I also feel the rapid passage of time acutely. It seems like just yesterday I was holding her for the first time, and now she is a bright, imaginative, and intelligent little girl who amazes me daily.

Reflecting on these past three years, I see how much I have grown alongside Violet. Fatherhood has taught me resilience, patience, and the true essence of unconditional love. It has also deepened my determination to work hard and secure her future. As I continue on this path, I am constantly reminded of love's power and the resilience of the human spirit.

Sitting here, flooded with nostalgia, pride, and some anxiety about the future, I recognize that every moment with Violet is a precious gift. She has brought immense joy and purpose into my life. I am committed to being the best father I can be, ensuring she always feels loved, supported, and encouraged to chase her dreams. Together, we will continue navigating this journey, building a future filled with love, hope, and endless possibilities."

happy,"These are the things I've quit to be more happy:

Competetive gaming: Its just a bunch of pixels on my screen that has no real value and it also made me lose the fun for videogames over the years. 

Social media: I still use social media but less than before. It took me a long time of self discipline to do that and nowadays I have a screen time of 20 min at best. I also think that social media helped me with that as well because whenever I read comments all I read are either bot comments, brainrot opinions or unnecessary hateful stuff. This also made me realize if the time I put into watching internet content is worth it or not. I have the mindset of using the Internet only for research purposes for things I dont know about so I can learn new stuff.

Bad eating behavior: I used to heavily rely on vitamin pills because I would always refuse to eat certain things because a doctor on YouTube would tell me this is bad or that is bad etc. It really ruined me as a person but today I'm doing a bit better now. I feel more happy now that my body is receiving the natural vitamins which was craving for years.

Being home all the time: I always saw my home as a ""safe"" place where I always wanted to stay all the time. 

Its quite dangerous over time and it does get to you mentally. I wasnt afraid of going outside and I dont have social anxiety but I always felt comfy being home and not doing stuff outside. Nowadays I always try to go outside whenever I can unless Im out of energy. I even bought a professional camera JUST so I can have a reason to go outside and do some nice pictures of nature or other things that look nice.

Quitting all of these things made me more of a happy person and I appreciate life more. Im almost 22 and honestly... maybe I should've listened to my mom but my teenage self had other things in mind. 

Have a nice day everyone :D"
happy,"Quit my job

Recently quit my full time job. Was a good position and good pay but my manager went behind my back and basically just gave my position away and expected me to take the demotion purely because she was struggling at the other location and needed me back there to help. It was nothing to do with me or my work as I was really good at my job (don't mean to be bigheaded) but she allowed this other lady to introduce herself to all my colleagues as the manager of my location when they all know that i was there. 
I was really upset because it made it look like it was because I couldn't do my job and she completely broke any trust I had for her. I loved my job and I'm pretty upset BUT I stood up for myself and didn't stand for the lack of respect and told her where to go. I'm proud of myself for doing so and happy I'm no longer working under her. I'm confident I'll get a good job again that gives me the respect and decency I'm owed.

Just needed a lil rant lol don't mind me"
happy,"I actually have a small business based on that. I sell home baked goodies around the holidays. I know my baking, it's good since I get so many customers I have to refuse the newer ones. It can't be otherwise, I use high quality ingredients and respect de recipe religiously. 

I've got compliments before but never from my friends. Not from my past friends or boyfriend. At least nothing more than ""yeah it's fine"" or ""it's good"" and that after insisting to take a bite. I remember I'd be so discouraged when my ex would prefer a burnt brownie over at least trying something I made. 

So yesterday we were at the canteen talking about small businesses. I never mentioned I had one. My friend sujested I should start one since my baking is so good. She said I'd make her so happy when I invited her over for dinner. She even has some pictures marked as favorite in her phone. She then said she never tried something like it till then. I can't remember all of it but she continued praising it to my other friend. 

I am so lucky having around people that genuinely love me! It really felt sincere. For the first time from a friend and not a customer."
happy,"Yesterdays workout turned into a slightly longer session than planned. I bought myself a luxurious licorice pipe (not the usual (Swedes knows which one I mean) , but an unknown, more expensive fancy variant!) and planned to treat myself after the session if I did well. The session felt... meh. I go to the reception to return a belly belt I borrowed for maxing out on the leg press, and then I see a guy yelling and causing a scene because his gym card is canceled for some reason. He's loud and creating an aggressive atmosphere. The receptionist is young and thin (less than 50kg), looking very uncomfortable. She has called the police. I try to talk to him.

- If you can't get in, and she only sees that it's blocked, and asks you to contact customer service, then there's nothing more to do. It's not her fault that your gym card is blocked.

But he talks about how badly he's being treated and tries to turn it into a racist thing.

- Call the police, do it! I'm not leaving this place!

And that I'm on the wrong side of what's right and wrong in the world.

- I swear to God! Jalla!

He gets up on a chair and starts waving and screaming even more. I tell him that when he's threatening and aggressive, it's not okay. It's still not her fault. If she asks you to leave, you have to leave. She's the one in charge here.

But he refuses to listen and just keeps rambling about... I don't really know what. That if it were the other way around, he wouldn't be treated this way, and blah blah blah. I wasn't on the HUMAN side, but on the INHUMAN side!

Mkay. Sure, but now she's asking you to leave. She can't do anything about it. He tries to call customer service, but as they don't answer at this time, he gets upset about how unfair it is. Gets up on the chair again, screaming and waving, hitting the lights above him, causing them to flicker. After maybe twenty long minutes of meaningless ranting, three police officers finally come and remove him, and talks to the receptionist.

I go back and stretch a bit. After a while, she comes by, and I see that she is upset and close to tears. First, she apologizes for what happened; it's not something I should have to endure. But she was glad that I was there and handled the situation. I say no worries, it was obvious I had to do something. And SHE shouldn't have to endure this at work. 

I go shower and sauna, and when I'm done and on my way going through the gym to the entrance, I see her again, and ask if she likes licorice. 

-Yes, she answers curiously. I offer her my luxury licorice pipe. She is surprised and wonders if I don't want it for myself. I say it would have been my reward if I had a good session, but it was meh. And, I think she should have something good happening today. She thanked me and said it made her very happy! And that made me happy too, despite the bad session. Win-win! "

happy,"Now i don't live on this subreddit, however ima write a thing that kinda makes me smile right now

In my school we got a class called ""musical"", volentarily, where basically everyone that is in his last 2 grades helps performing a musical (11th grade \[second to last\] helps, 12th (last) on stage). My teacher is doing this job for 20 years already, so he knows what he has to do, and what will happen. HOWEVER we are his first premiere, the first one to perform the musical ""School Of Rock"" in our country (Germany).

We've began to practice a few weeks ago, we knew our singing parts more or less already, so it wasn't such a big deal. Now that we are on our final days it starts to hit us, that we will be standing for so many people, singing, shouting and dancing. And boy/girl you don't know how happy i am. It might be that i am going crazy again, but boyyy/guuuurlll i can't stop smiling, it's gonna be nexxt weeeeeeek :D

happy,"If a genie or another supernatural being approached me when I was 10 years old and asked me for three wishes, I would definitely ask for the following: 

* to find true love (I was a very romantic kid, haha)
*  to become a teacher
*  and to make video games. 

It took a long time, but finally, at the age of 30, I met the most wonderful woman ever, and she miraculously fell in love with me too. That happened in 2016. 

For various reasons, I had started and quit my studies multiple times. However, in 2020, I was finally able to teach my first class in high school! Yes, it was the year of the pandemic, and it was challenging, but I loved it and it has become my profession. 

In January of this year (2023), I decided that it was time to seriously pursue making video games. In November, I released my first game! It was an amazing experience, to the point that game development has become my number one hobby. 

I don't know what the future holds, what 2024 will bring for me or for anyone reading this, but I hope we all continue to pursue our wishes, and maybe even reach them. Happy new year!"

happy,"This morning I was walking around my apartment and my feet were cold from the tile floor. This was annoying until I realized that this meant my feet’s nerves were working again 🥳🥳🥳🥳. 

This is the first time this year it’s been cold where I live, so I’m not sure how long I have been able to feel the bottom of my feet for. Maybe it came back slowly and I just didn’t notice?

So what happened was several years ago I lost the feeling on the bottom of my feet and toes from wearing high heels for sorority recruitment. I was wearing high heels on concrete for 6 days around 10 hours a day and since I’m tall I had to stand in the back and jump nonstop every time girls were entering or leaving our sorority house.

After a few months the feeling returned to my toes but not the pads of the bottom of my feet. I had seen several specialists and they said pretty much there’s nothing we could do except wait and hope the nerves came back. After a couple of years I didn’t think they would ever come back.

I do not know how it is possible that the nerves could repair themselves years later. But they’re definitely back. I used my finger nail on the bottom of my feet and I can feel it so it isn’t just temperature I can feel 🥳🥳🥳

My feet now feel super tingly from the cold so I think they’re just having to readjust to being able to feel again or something but I’m so excited🥳🥳🥳"
happy,"I’m nervous but also really proud of myself because I made a doctors appointment and I haven’t been in five or six years because we don’t have public transpertation in my town, I can’t drive and people that could drive me always had something going on, also I have some pretty bad phone anxiety. I have no idea what I’ll need to do, because its been so long, and even before than it had been another five or so years, so I’m at a lost, but super excited that I’m finally getting things done."
happy,"We (24F) and (22M) met on an app called Yocket, which is popular in India for graduate abroad studies. One day, she texted in the group about the decision deadline for a particular university. I saw the message and made a joke, which made her laugh. Intrigued, I wanted to learn more about her, so I checked out her profile. It turned out she had applied and got an admit from the same university where I had applied.

I decided to direct message her, asking about her application process and the decision. What started as professional college talk gradually turned into more personal conversations about our day-to-day activities and common interests. It all began on March 19th, 2023. Her age-related freakouts, even when we were just friends, were adorable.

By July, we found ourselves flirting without even fully knowing that we were “flirting”. We gave each other nicknames—I call her Goldie, and she calls me Twee. The nicknames stemmed from a funny story; she forgot few things, so I jokingly called her Goldfish (with its 15-second memory), which eventually led to Goldie. Twee came from star > twinkle > twee; she called me Starfish (with no brain) after I said something silly.

As I was about to fly to the USA for my higher studies on August 8th and yeah she couldn’t make it this year cause of some personal reasons, she sent me a long, heartfelt text when I was at the airport. It made me realize I was leaving something behind in India, even though my dream was to live in the USA. The text stirred emotions in me that I had never felt before.In the USA, I struggled to express my feelings or ask her out, but on August 13th, I finally did it, and she said, ""Fuck yes."" Despite not meeting or speaking on calls, we texted for hours every day. However, we knew long-distance wouldn't work without meeting in person, so I decided to visit her after my first semester, which was six months away. We didn't meet before I flew to the USA because I'm from a city that's 350 kilometers away from hers, and we also didn't acknowledge our feelings while I was living in India. We regretted that after August too much, and it was hilarious.

After a month, we started doing calls and decided to meet in person, skipping video calls and only sharing pictures. Although we knew we were in love, we didn't say it outright; instead, we used phrases like ""I purple you"" and ""I l you."" Purple became our color because One day, while I was assisting her with the application process, she thanked me with a purple heart instead of a red one. Later, she revealed that she didn't want to give the ""wrong impression"" by sending red hearts lol. From that moment on, purple became our color in everything, from hearts to flowers and to act more goofy, like Avengers' ""I love you 3000,"" we chose 2468 as our special number.

In January, I flew to India, and on the 6th, we finally met. It was nerve-wracking as she sat at Cubbon Park in Bangalore, facing away from the entrance which was extremely adorable. When I tapped her shoulder, she turned and we hugged for solid two minutes which was the best moment of my life. I spent the entire January with her, When we began our personal conversations, we discovered a shared love for a special dessert: blueberry cheesecake. We always dreamt of sharing it in person, so after 6-7 months of anticipation, we finally had our first cheesecake date in January. We also exchanged bouquets of purple flowers and now that I've flown back to the US, I miss my baby Gold so much. I just wanna be with her all the time. I love her 2468."
happy,"I had a good day today and wanted to share, hopefully someone out there can relate.

I am recovering from Postpartum mood disorder, it manifested as anxiety, and I had 'baby brain' which I didn't understand until I started to regain the ability to make decisions and perform tasks without feeling overwhelmed.

Today I remembered to do the things I set myself as tasks just as I was falling asleep last night. I have difficulty falling asleep, I often lay awake for 2 hours, just random thoughts, and often remember things I've forgotten to do and make myself mental to do list which I then regularly forget. Such as put pen and paper on bedside table to write down the to do list. (No phone near bed) Anyways, last night I remembered that I had forgotten to reply to an email I received a week ago, and today I replied, first little win. I also remembered I had to email stationery shop to get them to print a document for me, and I also remembered to go to the stationery shop to collect the print out. Double little win.

The biggest little win for me today was answering phone call that I felt was going to be awkward conversation, phone rang, I looked at display, realised it was awkward conversation, felt dread, thought about ignoring it and letting it ring out, but I answered, had the awkward conversation, and then it was done, finished, no more dread. Little win.

It doesn't sound like much I know, but to me it's a day of wins.

4 years ago I had a shopping bag full of unopened letters, that I was hiding because I didn't know what to do with them. Nothing scary in them, usual household bills, statements, renewal information, nothing that today I couldn't handle. But 4 years ago, it felt impossible. Postman would bring letters, I took them out of post box, and then stuffed them in shopping bag I hid in garage. Why? I don't know exactly. If I opened a letter I would then have to 'deal with it', whatever it was, and in my Postpartum mood I couldn't. The thought of opening envelope, then reading contents, then making decision to file document, go to home office room, go to bookcase, find appropriate folder, find hole punch, place document in folder, well, that was just impossible to accomplish. And that was for simple notification letter. What if it was a letter I had to do something with? Car insurance renewal? No way. Couldn't handle that. Ringing around to get quotes, comparing policies, nope, couldn't do it. Just hide the letters.

Today I can open letters. It's taken a long time to get here, I did it and I'm celebrating the little wins. If you understand, wonderful."
happy,"I love being able to form an environment where people feel safe and comfortable around me. I love listening to people's needs and giving them a safe enough space to express those needs and trust that I won't belittle them for it. 

I just saw a post about this guy who kept getting sick and was worried his girlfriend and sister were poisoning him, and I thought about how me and my girlfriends cook for one another all the time. I get that it's the most basic and normal ass thing to trust someone to cook for you. People in restaurants trust complete strangers to cook for them all the time. But it's kinda sweet when you think about it, that someone you know a lot about and loves you trusts you unsupervised to prepare a substance to put in their body. It's neat. 

Not to mention trusting me not to hurt them too bad when we bring knifeplay into the bedroom (WHICH IS A MUCH BIGGER FORM OF TRUST I KNOW) or trusting me to tie them up or to touch their naked bodies. Ugh, I did that. I fosterd a loving relationship enough times over and over that another person (two people!) will let me have my hands on them in one of their most vulnerable moments. 

And people trusting me to prepare drugs for them. I've had people leave it in my hands, again unsupervised, to measure and dose their first experience with psychedelics. It's an honor, really, to be a good enough person that someone else (who at the time had never met me in real life!) finally met me, and felt comfortable enough to trust me to properly drug them for a good experience. It's sweet. It makes me feel good. I like when people are comfortable around me, and I don't understand how other people enjoy (or at least act like they enjoy) the opposite. "
happy,I've never experienced love like this before. I'm actually happy now ☺️
happy,"I just got back from a trip to Idaho for my nieces high school graduation. I had casually kept a good relationship over text with my niece ever since she moved from Southern California to Texas to Idaho in less than a few months. I knew she was going through a lot emotionally and with college coming up it was stressful. I remember how I was at that age (I graduated 2003 and also switched high schools my sr year).

Come graduation day we're in the gymnasium and all the families are still kinda getting seated. I can see all the chairs for the seniors to sit on, I see all the administration on stage and the band in the back playing some songs. Then I see some of her family on her moms side get super excited and I look down to my right to see what the commotion's about. It's a sash that said ""Valedictorian"".

What?! Not only was my niece Valedictorian of her class, she absolutely CRUSHED it. She's already a full year ahead into her college coursework, passed every AP exam she took, played Bass Clarinet through school, did Softball and went to State Championships. She's like a superhuman.

I don't have any kids of my own, but the amount of pride I feel for her is immense. To top it all off she got a full ride to the University of Idaho and she plans on studying Neuroscience (you know, easy stuff). And she's still highly critical of herself and self analyses a ton looking for any way to be better in almost anything she does. The coolest thing I ever did was play video games professionally on a stage - this girl's about to solve complex brain problems as a hobby.

As a reward for all her hard work I made her a promise - a thing I never do because I hate making promises as I hate even the idea of not being able to keep one. I promised her if she graduated with a 4 year degree (not even necessarily in neuroscience, I gave her that leeway) that I'd personally pay for and accompany her on a trip to Japan. And since she's worked so hard in high school she's already got a year head start. I now have 3 years to save up for a Japan trip. Worst Best promise ever."
happy,Very damn well pleased with myself.
happy,That’s all. I’m a 53-year-old woman and I melted right then and there.
happy,"I'm really excited about it! with this job I can get my own place and actually afford to live on my own with money to spare! 

All signs on their end point to actually wanting me as an employee too! I actually feel like this could be a new start for me! like really! For once, I'm excited about my future!"
happy,I live in Florida so pretty soon it’ll be too hot to spend entire days out here so we enjoy it when we can!!
happy,"I’m feeling really proud of myself, and I’m super appreciative of all of the people that gave me feedback and help along the way. Wanted to share this feeling with everyone!!"
happy,I felt so happy to see nature and these ducks. 
happy,"I havent seen my amazing, caring, lovely, sweet, hot, beautiful, smart girlfriend in AGES. and today we are going to friends&burgers and the movies. I'm gonna pay for EVERYTHING because i want only the best for her. "
happy,"Like the title, I’ve moved far away from home and I had never done this before. I always lived in the place where I was born. I honestly never even thought I would move. Last year, I was promoted to manager for a company and I had a LOT of work to do. I needed help, but then lost some accounts and didn’t need as much help anymore. Someone told me early last year that they should’ve taken the opportunity to move back home when they had the chance (to my hometown - he was helping me for a while, and he lived 400+ miles away.)

It was a seed in the back of my mind to POSSIBLY eventually move. His best friend moved to my hometown to help me full time. Meanwhile, I grew feelings for a friend who said he was moving to where this guy lives. I still thought about moving, but thought there’s no way I would move for a guy just because I like him. (We aren’t in a relationship, but I am crazy about him. lol) 

Well, as luck (or fate?) would have it, I lost even more business at work through no fault of my own. I was desperate for a change because I needed to make more money. I don’t have a roommate and I have bills I need to be able to pay. No other job applications were going anywhere. My friend that I mentioned above suggested that I move out of my hometown, and I thought it might actually not be a bad idea to have more work in a bigger city, like he said. I thought really intensely about it and talked about it with my closest friends and family. 

Even the guy who worked for me was afraid of losing his job. I told him not to worry because I was thinking of moving to take his best friend’s place - he was in a hard spot financially too, and would have help in my hometown to get back on his feet. Every single person I told about the possibility of me moving said to 100% do it. (Well, aside from my parents, but they have been supportive even when I told them my crush moved away. I thought they were the crazy ones for that. LOL)

I got home from vacation after thinking long and hard about moving, and I drafted the email to send to my boss about moving to two possible locations. One because I had family there, and the other because I KNEW the other guy wanted to move earlier in the year back to my hometown. I had just spent my vacation near where he was living, and I liked it - but I was NOT thinking of moving when I took that trip. Lo and behold, when I got back home, I nearly went negative in my bank account. I had to return socks and underwear because I just couldn’t afford it. My car payment was coming up and I was so scared. 

I thought about if I were to move, what amount of money would I need to do it? The number $5k popped up and I figured that would be just enough to move. I had no idea how I would get the money. As if by magic, within 3 days, I never went negative in the bank and I had $5k to my name in addition to everything I needed for bills that month. My boss was totally willing to facilitate the move and the guy was desperate to move back home, even though he didn’t WANT to leave. He HAD to leave. 

It’s just been amazing how smoothly this has all worked out. I was terrified of moving here because I don’t know anyone very well, but I do have some friends in the surrounding areas whom I hope to get to know better. The cherry on top is that the friend I have feelings for lives here too, but I am not going to push anything with him. I didn’t move here FOR him, but it’s definitely a big perk, in my opinion. I don’t even know if he likes me at all. But it’s just so weird how everything has panned out. I am not complaining though. I absolutely adore this place already. 

All my life I thought I would hate it up here. I can’t think of a single negative other than my small family and my closest friends aren’t here. However, since moving, I am actually talking to my friends and family MORE than before! They care about my whereabouts and how I am doing so they are checking on me more often and making more of an effort, which is really nice. 

I am just so elated to be here in my quiet little bubble - in a beautiful city, which so far hasn’t given me anxiety much at all, despite it being so much bigger than where I am from. Everyone has been so incredibly friendly and, again, everything has been so smooth. It feels like it was meant to be. My mind is blown by this experience and honestly, it’s only been 48 hours, but I don’t think I’ll ever move back home unless I absolutely have to, and even then, I am sure it would be temporary."
happy,"Workplace moment

I had a mentally bad morning after my birthday and was having a moment thinking about how certain people in my life would react if I wasn’t in this world (for context this doesn’t happen often and I am ok now).

When I came to work I turned the corner and my colleagues sang happy birthday and had a cake out for me. 

Fair to say my day went from 0-100 after that. It’s the little things that matters, even if you don’t ask if someone’s okay."
happy,I (F18) talked to the army three months ago about joining just for the fun of it. I had no idea that I could get trained as an LPN. (I want to be a doctor one day so this will get me started in building my career) I signed my contract at MEPs yesterday. I'm really excited to be able to go to college and be able to move out of my parent's house!! 
happy,"

My professor had embarrassed me in front of the whole class because I did not know one answer. He started asking me my name and throwing comments about how I don't know anything and all. He made me stand in front of everyone. Nevertheless, I, someone who's suffering from anxiety disorder and severe anxiety, someone who gets embarrassed so very easily, for the first time, did not get embarrassed. 

I was pretty chill tbh. I did not have a raised heartbeat, I did not feel extremely sad, I did not panic, I might have had a few tics but that's it. After he left, I just went about doing my job and honestly I was impressed with myself. Idk whether this happended because I have a bigger embarrassing situation/trauma to deal with such that this felt so small or because I was already tired of everyone's sh!t. 

It happened and I'm honestly kinda happy."
happy,Granted I only got an A with two extra credit points (otherwise it would be a very high B) but no matter what I am extremely happy that I passed my Calc II exam. Integration techniques was a very fun section! 
happy,Cancer free
happy,You’re very lovely people. I wish you happiness and peace. I pray you are blessed and have a wonderful Christmas! May it be full of laughs and good food. I wish joy on all of you. Have a great Christmas Day!
happy,"Two years ago I was in the darkest place I’ve ever reached and I’m sure it wasn’t that bad but for my young brain at the time, I thought I’d never get to be happy.I posted in TW depression pages/ suicide daily.  Being happy was a foreign concept to me my whole teenage hood and child hood I often had depression Until I worked on it hard very hard. 

Fast forward to today, I am currently laying in bed so content next to my husband and my cats are cuddled up between us purring and I often find myself crying since getting pregnant that I’m happy and grateful I am to be here, but !! I was smiling  and happy crying at life before I got flooded with pregnancy hormones. 

Long story short I think I’m finally happy I am confidently able to say it. 

"
happy,"So I have a lazy right eye and I'm right handed for everything.  When I look through the scope I don't  have an easy time lining up the scope because my left eye is dominate and tries to take focus. When I close my left eye, my already squinty eye gets worse. So I haven't shot in years because its so hard. 

I decided I needed a new hobby that got me outside so I started practicing left handed. After an hour or so I had the gun sited in. The tree is 75 freedom units away. I taped it so I could see if the pellet hit or just took the bark away. 

The second pic is me trying to hit the ribbon, then trying to hit the same hole. Didn't work.  You can see the 2nd small nick. That was from 30 fu's free hand.  The hits on the  post were my next two shots from 100fu's leaning against the outhouse. Trying to hit the stick, then hit the same pellet spot. I can't see the pellets but I was just aiming for what i think is the same spot."
happy,Yum!!
happy,"after dealing with anxiety my whole life and suffering a lot of traumatic events, i finally got the help i needed (prozac/fluoxetine) !!

i finally feel happy and less anxious, im arguing with my dad less and things are looking up ! yay !!!! 😁 life is good and it DOES in fact get better"
happy,"When we were kids, our immediate family was pretty low-income. So when we were visiting, our grandpa would often take a few of the grandkids to “grab coffee” from a well known donut shop. We’d get there and he’d say to the employees, “A black coffee and a whatever these guys want.” 

My brother and I would have mere seconds to select a single donut from the wall of deliciousness, and I often would feel overwhelmed with choice in the moment. We loved going to “grab coffee” with grandpa. 

Fast-forward about 25 years or so, and my brother and I live far from our hometown in different states. I text him and he absolutely remembered getting donuts with Grandpa, so with a bit of planning, we roped a friend of mine in who still lives in the old stomping grounds. 

This morning, I called my grandpa, then added my brother to the call. Grandpa is 87, and had to put us on speakerphone because one of his hearing aids needed to be charged. We chat to him for a moment, then my friend (and his mom, who used to go to church with my grandpa) rolls up with a box of donuts and a black coffee. 

Grandpa was surprised and a little confused at first, but was delighted that we remembered his coffee after all these years. Then he hung up on us (most of his phone calls don’t last more than 60 seconds) so he could chat to my friend and his mom. 

Honestly, it was such a delight to organize something unexpected for such a generous and caring gentleman who had such an impact on me and my brother. 

TL/DR grandpa used to take us to get donuts so we had donuts delivered to him even though we live far away."
happy,"After dealing with both clogged ears since Oct 2022, multiple ER visits, walk-in clinics, doctors, mineral oils, hydrogen peroxide, failed referrals to ENTS, I finally found an ear doctor that was willing to help me. He was able to unclog both my ears!

I can finally hear again. 

Nature, music, sounds I never heard before are all overwhelming. It’s like having surround sound!

Grateful for the small things. I am happy not to ask people to repeat themselves anymore!"
happy,"See the before and after, but this fireplace hadn't been touched in years and was not being used

I ripped out the old tile, poured a new base, pressure washed the fireplace, painted the cast iron, used lemon juice to clean the barss exterior, and retiled the entire thing

Thank God for YouTube"
happy,"Each design is 100% hand-drawn by me using a digital tablet, a real artist that actually draws.

No gimmicks no Ai or any automated special effects – just skilled artistry that will capture every detail."
happy,"Lately I've been into collage thanks to the algorithm making me watch videos of scrapbooking and journaling. I've never been good with handmade stuff and I'm very conscious of it because I've never been ""excellent"" with that type of stuff. But that videos are really nice to watch and I keep thinking I want to do it too.

As soon as I told my husband that I wanted to try it he lent me his account for buying the materials even though we're on a tight budget (I had surgery recently because of a broken bone in my left hand). He never said ""You can't do it"", ""You aren't good with those things"", ""You only do it because of the videos"" or other stupid things I thought when I decided to tell him I wanted to try it. He even said it was nice because I could do it as rehab for my hand... It's been a week since then and he's following our orders and even helping me do my first collages because there's some things I still can't do with my hand.

I was afraid that as I finished my first one he would notice I'm terrible at it and maybe he would be mad for spending that money but quite the contrary he said it looked good and encouraged me to keep going.

He's not only aknowledging my desire to try a new hobby as valid but also he's giving me courage to challenge myself in things I always felt unsuited for.

 I'm really thankful for him..."
happy,I’m so happy to see how far he has come and to watch him get healthy!
happy,"I was a mess for two decades, booze, coke, just whatever. I have now made it two years without a drink or any coke. I'm so happy right now. I was able to go back to school and I went from a 36 waist to a 30. I later gave up sodas and energy drinks, but alcohol was the tough one. Two years!!!"
happy,I live in Florida so pretty soon it’ll be too hot to spend entire days out here so we enjoy it when we can!!
happy,"Ever since I was a teenager I wanted a pair but they were always too expensive for me. My BF took the plunge and for my birthday (which is in a month, but he wanted me to get the most out of these boots during January lol) him and my best friends split the costs on the gift. They are in the box next to my bed as I'm typing this. I feel like a little child that got a very precious toy and can't sleep without hugging it. I almost ran up the wall when I first tried them on.

I wanted to share this here. I feel bougie and expensive with these Demonia boots lol"
happy,I just feel so much better now that I've learned to cope with all of my mental health issues and even though is not perfect I just feel so proud of myself :))
happy,"This month, I haven’t had a bad day, a suicidal thought or a moment of insecurity. How the fuck is this possible? I can’t believe I’m saying this but I’m genuinely happy. Purely, completely. This is no mood swing or an unusually happy day, because I’ve been consistently happy for weeks. I.. 

1. Kept real friends who actually care 
2. Stopped surrounding myself with sad stuff, like certain .. communities 
3. Go outside more. Work out 
4. This is a bit ironic because I met someone amazing on here but stopped talking to those random redditors lol, they’re usually a mess. No offence 
5. USE LESS SOCIAL MEDIA. Huge part
6. Enjoy my hobbies 

Mama was right, it was that damn phone 

here’s to a smooth ride ahead 🍦😁


"
happy,"So, I’m 21 and have gone through a lot of hardship over the last few years. This has made me change my general plan for life a couple of times. But, after switching my major a few times, I decided I want to get a BS in IT. When I’m done with school, I want to move to Las Vegas. I was born in Las Vegas and lived there for the first 10 years of my life. Besides, IT does much better in Vegas than the state I live in. 

I also figured out, after soul searching the last month, that I really am trans (I had a period where I questioned if transitioning was the right choice for me and I figured out it was and I want to continue it!), I don’t want kids, I’m a stoner, and I’d be content being single. However, if someone comes along that’s fine too. I’m very eccentric (very neurodivergent and crazy life), so if I’m gonna find someone romantically, they’re gonna be in a place like Las Vegas. Basically, what I thought I wanted in life is very different then what I “wanted” in life at 19. I put quotations as I used to think, “I should live this way” instead of thinking of what I wanted.  

I fell into a deep depression after a break up around thanksgiving as I questioned what my true purpose in life was. I asked, “In spite of all of my challenges (like my 4 diagnosed mental illnesses which are all severe), why do I choose to continue to live?” Realizing all of this tonight was like answering that question which has been plaguing me for a while now. 

I’m much more happy and content with this plan. I hope I end up happy with it and the ways reality differs from my plan."
happy,Not to Jinx myself and I'm knocking on wood. But next week I've been at my job eleven years. It makes me happy because growing up I had learning issues and was in special Ed. And the teachers were not nice. I was told I would never go to college and ide never hold a job. I have so far done both. And I feel..well proud of myself in a way I've beaten odds and expectations. I was told i would be nothing but a failure.
happy,"
My parents don’t love me and haven’t for a long time and I’m happy with that. Recently, my parents have shown their true colors to a lot of people, especially me. I’ve come to learn that they have only loved me conditionally, if I provide something to them. They weaponize my siblings against me, try to financially cripple me, and just try to make me feel as bad as possible. Ever since I’ve been sure of what I wanna do for a career, my mother and sister have constantly belittled it. My mother has said that my sister is her favorite and my parents have always shown that for as long as I can remember. I realize now that they don’t love me anymore and I’m happy I can move on with my life. I’ve accepted that they never will for as long as I live, and I can finally grow and surround myself with people who truly love and care about me. "
happy,"I just got the best news!!!

After months of waiting, many tests, background checks and a fun 4 hour long psych eval with even more tests involved…

I got offered a job as a County Detention Deputy!!!!

It’s almost double the yearly salary I have been getting for the last few years!

This is fantastic news!!!!"

happy,"I’m going with 2 of my close girl friends. I’ve done cruises with family before but I’ve never traveled as an adult, both in the US and internationally,  without family (parents) or husband. Now I’m 31, divorced, just got out of an awful relationship, and i am SO excited for these next adventures. I’m going to see some BEAUTIFUL places, learn fascinating history, drink, laugh, meet new people, and I can hardly wait. 

I’ve been through a pretty wild ride the last several years and I just feel like I am in a really good place. I have good friends, good family, a job I love that pays the bills, and I am able to do things like get a Disneyland pass and travel to new places. I am so happy and grateful to be where I am in life and I hope everyone finds this level of contentment ❤️"

Yesterday made him breakfast, homemade angel food cake (with fresh strawberry toppings), and we went to his cousins for an epic hot pot dinner. Today is his 'lazy' day where he wasn't supposed to do anything but relax. This morning I made breakfast again, cleaned the kitchen, and did laundry. I was super exhausted and laid down to watch a movie. Shortly after my husband comes in with this! The plate was full, but I was so hungry I started eating before I took a picture. My hormones are crazy right now but I'm just so happy! I even cried a little."
happy,You can do it too!!!
happy,She was on opiates/heroin really hard but i loved her even then and just hoped she could over come it.  She did and we got togethor and have a beautiful 5 month old daughter. Anyone out there using you can beat that *%#!.

But I'm alive, I have a roof, usually have food. There are a lot of people that can't say the same. I've been severely depressed since I was young, a lot of people told me to ""die"", or that ""I definitely wouldn't make it to adulthood"" (guess what, bitches). Eighteen years old is like a baby that can vote, I have a lot to figure out. I'm just beginning life. 

I'll treat myself tomorrow, I'll order in a LOT of food, and binge watch my favorite movie saga. I'm so proud of myself!!! 😎"

happy,"Hi, just posting here because I like the vibe and everyone sub talking about jobs is depressing and bleh. I have a question, I was recently hired into the bank 6 months ago with no prior experience and I am loving it. I recently got a promotion and I'm starting to stress because I don't know where I want this to take me. I'm very excited, as I know I will do very well but I want to try to refine what I want to do so I have more of a direction but have no idea how to find out what I wanna do. Also, how do I relax and enjoy my life, instead of always thinking about work and where I could do better, Thanks!!"

happy,"When I finally got up the courage to go to the dentist, I discovered that I needed an old crown replaced, 2 fillings, and, worst of all, 2 root canals. I am terrified of drilling and each time I had to go to an appointment over the past few months, I had to steel myself. However, this entire few years that I have gone without seeing a dentist, I knew that it was just a matter of time before I had a major problem, or even caused myself a serious health problem. It was like I had a shadow of worry always hanging over my shoulder, even in happy moments, and I knew the only way to dismiss it was to finally go to the dentist and let them fix every single problem.  

I had been saving up for a new car, so that money is all gone now, but I don’t need a new car the way I need the blissful peace of mind that comes with finally resolving a serious problem that has followed me for years.  

And actually, it ended up being not the worst case scenario. I didn’t lose a single tooth. I didn’t have to get any implants. If I do better at taking care of my teeth going forward, I hope I can keep all of them. And I hope I don’t ever have to do a root canal again. And my mouth feels so much better.  

edit to add: I just want to describe some things that happened during my first appointment. I was so terrified I was trembling violently. During the part where they were examining my teeth, with various sharp implements, every time it hurt so much, I would flinch violently. Tears began to stream from the corners of my eyes. Until finally the dentist said “Do you need a moment?” and I sat up and the tech fetched my water bottle from my backpack. All of this was in the FIRST appointment, and all they were trying to do was find what was wrong, and what needed to be fixed, and I was so afraid, and my injured teeth hurt SO much. It was, all of it, built upon old childhood trauma, drilling when I wasn’t really numb, an elderly dentist chasing me around the chair and then yelling at my mother not to bring me in again if I was too stupid to let him help me.   

Anyway. I somehow made it through. Perhaps that first appointment _was_ the worst. Worse even than the root canals. "
happy,"This is gonna start off sad, but I swear it gets better. 

August 2021 I graduated college. October 2021 I was given a job offer for a career I was incredibly excited about. The job offer payed decently, and was a stepping stone for my ex-gf and I at the time to be able to start moving our relationship into a more adult-relationship; ie, moving out, buying a house, etc. 

January 2022 I started at my job and loved it. March 2022 came around, and my ex at the time had blind-sided me and left without a word. I was devastated at the time. Fast forward a few months to October, I’m at the gym and I feel a tendon in the back of my leg snap. I can’t walk. I eventually go to the doctor who just diagnoses me with a strain and tells me to go to PT. 

Long story short, I visited 2 different doctors. Both of whom could not give me a proper diagnosis which caused the PT I received to only make things worse. I was on disability from my job to take care of my leg which just wouldn’t get better, as well as therapy for depression. Eventually, I was forced to leave my job, lost my health insurance, and didn’t know if I’d ever be able to walk again. I was alone, depressed, disabled, unemployed, and had no idea about the future and what was going to happen to me. 

Eventually, I found a physio who I was able to see via Zoom (about $20/visit, so I could afford it without insurance) who was able to diagnose me and we started a PT program that I was able to do by myself. It took a long time, but she got me back on my feet, back in the gym, back to running and everything. It took me about a year to walk again. It was an extremely long process. 

Near the end of my PT, I met this woman. Smart, funny, gorgeous, kind, driven and hard working, incredibly emotionally intelligent, and… well I could go on for hours talking about this woman. We hit it off, and started dating. She’s introduced me to so many new hobbies, many of which are active activities. Some team sports, and some individual sports. I’ve started some new sports of my own, and have began to introduce her to them as well. Not only has meeting her changed my life romantically, but I’ve also gotten very close to all of her friends of which she has many. When my leg didn’t work and I lost my job, I was alone almost 24/7. I had very little help with anything from family and friends. It was the darkest time of my life. Now, I feel like it’s one of the most social and happiest times of my life. It’s been a complete 180 from where I was before. 

When my leg got better, I also applied for a federal job. I’d always wanted to work for the federal government, not just for the benefits but also for the job security. It was a very long and stressful process, but just last week I received the email with a firm job offer and I am due to begin working with them next week. 

My life has completely changed. I was in the darkest time of my life, not knowing what was going to happen to me and not knowing if I’d ever be able to walk again, hold a job, etc. I’ve now picked up a handful of new hobbies, I’m exercising and running frequently, I have a new career which I’m beyond ecstatic to begin, and a wonderful girlfriend of which I can see an actual future with. 

Words cannot begin to describe how absolutely ecstatic I am for what my future holds. "

happy,"So today was garbage collection day in my neighborhood and my usual routine is walk out to my backyard, unlock the gate to my backyard, walk out to my front yard and collect the trash can, roll back the trash can back to the gate of my backyard, open the gate to my backyard, roll the trash can through the gate into my backyard, close the gate, but today life had other plans for me. To preface this, the lock on the gate to my backyard is an old fashioned hook where you close the gate and push the hook through it.

I observed the garbage truck collecting my trash at around 01:15 PM today and decided to just collect the trash can now so I don't have to do it later at night. There was heavy gusts of wind and a violent rainpour but I just decided to push through it. I opened the door to my backyard and sprinted through my backyard like an olympian while enjoying the feeling of the wind blowing against my hair and the free shower from the water droplets. I unlocked my backyard gate and sprinted across my front yard to get the trash can and begin rolling the trash can across my front yard to finally get this mundane task over with. I approached the gate to my backyard ready to open it and finish this chore once and for all.

That's when life threw a wrench in my plans. I pushed against the gate to my backyard. It didn't bulge. I pushed again. It didn't bulge. That's when I realized that as I was rolling the trash can across my front yard to the gate of my backyard, the violent gusts of wind of the ongoing storm had blown the gate to my backyard shut and the hook lock to cover it as well. The front door was locked. I had no other way into my house other than the door to my backyard, but that was closed off due the gate being locked. Mind you, I didn't even have my phone, so I couldn't call for help if anything else went awry. That's when a lightbulb shined brightly over my head.

I pushed the trash can in front of the gate to my backyard. I climbed on top of my trash can, it took me 2 tries. Once on top, I looked down and just braced myself for the inevitable, the call of the void. I jumped over the fence and dropped down. It was a 5 foot drop. My legs didn't break fortunately. I unlocked the gate to my backyard and rolled in my trash can. The mundane task was done. I hope none of my neighbors saw me jumping over my own fence and call the cops on me. It looks truly suspicious from an outsider's perspective. Maybe next time I'll put a brick or something in the doorway so it doesn't shut out on me completely. This entire ordeal lasted 8 minutes, and it was the longest 8 minutes of my life.

At least I got my cardio in today. I can't wait to do this chore again in a week and see what happens. I'm coming to an action movie near you. Until then, have a nice day! This is JNORJT, signing off."
happy,"I was finishing some work, and I realized, while listening to a Gilmore Girls analysis video, that I have genuinely not felt suicidal in a couple of days! I've been going to school in the afternoon for the past week, leaving the mornings to myself, and I can see that my mood has been somewhat better! I unfortunately have to go to school tomorrow morning, but for what its worth, I've not been entirely suicidal lately!"
happy,"I’m going with 2 of my close girl friends. I’ve done cruises with family before but I’ve never traveled as an adult, both in the US and internationally,  without family (parents) or husband. Now I’m 31, divorced, just got out of an awful relationship, and i am SO excited for these next adventures. I’m going to see some BEAUTIFUL places, learn fascinating history, drink, laugh, meet new people, and I can hardly wait. 

I’ve been through a pretty wild ride the last several years and I just feel like I am in a really good place. I have good friends, good family, a job I love that pays the bills, and I am able to do things like get a Disneyland pass and travel to new places. I am so happy and grateful to be where I am in life and I hope everyone finds this level of contentment ❤️"

happy,"Hello everyone! If you look on my profile I’ve posted once a year about my weight loss. I started originally at 320 (although I was too embarrassed to admit it) and got to I think 250 before I got hurt, gained more weight, lost some. Now for 2023. Over the end of 2022 and into 2023 I let a coworker treat me to lunch every day. Where I ate a ton and really fell back into my old terrible habits and all that.
Since September something in me changed. (Also me and that coworker stopped talking, they were a terrible influence but I’m not go into that here) I have cut out most sugars and in general crappy food out. I usually eat one good meal a day. 
I originally started this just to lose weight out of embarrassment of how bad I had let myself go. Now, I just want to feel better. I’ve seen how much my diet change has improved how I feel and the lost weight helps a ton too. I feel so much better about myself. I just want to change now for the betterment of my health, now for how I look.
So here’s my post this year to keep myself accountable (and also people have said they wanted to see my updates as the years go on)
My end goal right now for this year is to be near 220, but I’d REALLY like to be under 200. So let’s see how 2024 will treat me and you and I hope we can accomplish our goals. If you made it this far reading, I thank you! See you next year!"

I spent 6 months in a homeless shelter, got my CDL, picked out a company of my choosing, bout to be an uncle 3 times over, and recently celebrated 7 months sober!

However, last week I decided to finally go the antibiotics route and got flagyl. And surprisingly, it worked. I have had zero symptoms for the past 3 days. I am super happy."
happy,"Things I saw the other morning on the way to work that made me genuinely feel happy and exclaim loudly (like, actually out loud) with joy :

🐾 Walking across the carpark saw a man walking his tiny dachsund puppy, he stepped off the curb but had to stop and look back cos the puppy had sat down on the edge of the curb. So the guy went back and picked him up and put him on the road and then the puppy walked after him with a big waggy tail.

The step off the curb was too high!! 🥹

🎈3 hot air balloons coming into land nearby. I saw about 5 in the sky but there were 3 landing in a park along the trainline. They're huge! I've never seen that before!! It was very exciting for me!!

Kinda made my day. No photos, but it all happened. Just wanted to share my feelings of joy. 😊

Have a good day!!!"
happy,"I cleaned my house after living in a pretty big mess after 2 years. For context: I live with my mom and grandpa. my mom is a hoarder and also battles manic depression so she buys a lot of things to comfort herself (not hoarders tv show level but clothes, shoes, journals, pens, books). My grandpa hoards food (not sure why) and doesn’t like to get rid of anything even if it’s expired from 2019. I also can be messy and not put things back where they go. I spent a year being mad that I had to clean the place at all because I felt like I shouldn’t have to clean up after perfectly capable people and I knew they wouldn’t make an effort to keep it clean. I guess I got over that last week because I cleaned the entire house and had about 6 garbage bags full of things to throw out that hadn’t been used in years. What really prompted the clean was my mom essentially went to stay with her sister and didn’t give me any warning or anything. I guess I felt like if the house was clean she’d come back home. This was a super long rant but anyway I’m just proud of myself that I have continued the efforts of keeping the house clean and putting things back where they go even if my grandpa and mom don’t contribute because I realized if I want the house to stay clean, it’s going to have to be me doing the clean up.

happy,Soooo satisfying
happy,"We found out she had uterine cancer last week, and they scheduled her for a hysterectomy immediately. She had surgery this morning, and it went great. Minimum blood loss, no sign of cancer. I'm so relieved I can't even tell you. Best day of my life."
happy,Was starting to feel worthless. I could cry I’m so stoked.
happy,"I never thought giving a gift would make me so happy. I live in India and my best friend always had this big desire to visit a special place for worshipping Krishna. Unfortunately, that place is very far away. But then I found out there is a similar place much closer to where we live, so I decided to take her there as a surprise.

I didn't tell her where I intended to take her. I just asked her when she had her holidays and around christmas we planned the trip. It took 4 hours to reach there and when we were just about to reach I gave her a note saying 'We will visit your favourite place one day soon. Until that time enjoy this little surprise from me'. When we were at front gate and she realized where we were she became so mesmerised. Seeing her so happy I felt very gratified. That was the first time I realized that love is about giving cause the more you give the more blissful you become.

We visited every temple, the people were chanting Hare Krishna and she was enjoying every little thing. She even took some of the soil from there as a memory. Seeing that she loved my surprise there was different level of joy within me and I truly felt what Sadhguru says 'How deeply you touch another life is how rich your life is'."
happy,I’m 44. Never thought I’d have kids. Today that changed. Say hi to Annie.
happy,"He loves history , spiders , technology , art and America . He’s got the most wonderful blue eyes and he likes to play in the snow like me. 

It’s never been about his appearance or anything material . I love his mind. I love speaking with him. I love every word out of his mouth. I’ve truly never felt such a deep passion for somebody. 

He’s 30 and I’m 25 and I swear I went 25 years of my life searching for a mind and soul like his . 

I love when we passionately flirt with each other and talking about breathing each other in and caressing each other . 

I love staying up late at night messaging him till I fall asleep and hearing him say his praises to me . 

C I love you forever and I want to be with you forever like this 

Give it 2 more years when I’m done with school and I think we’ll get married and by 5 more I think we might be able to have a family .. 

I wanna spend every thanksgiving and Christmas with you for the rest of my life 

C …. Please stay with me forever … you’re a beaming star in my night sky "
happy,"(Just to preface this, it happened yesterday, and I wrote it yesterday, so it’s in present tense, but happened yesterday)

So I have a lot of very noticeable self harm scars on my legs. Especially my right thigh. They’re basically all over, and pretty close to my knees. If I wear shorts, they’re extremely visible. Today, it was 85 degrees, and I also am in track and field.

I was super super nervous about wearing shorts to school today, because it’d really be the first time anyone would have seen my scars, and I was just freaking out. The day had gone pretty good, 2 girls asked me what happened to my leg, I just said “it’s not important” and they left it at that.

Then, at the end of track practice, a guy a couple grades older than me comes up to me, and says “hey, amazing-flute-piano, are those scars?” As he gestures towards his own leg. Internally, I’m dying. Like I’m soooo nervous for what he’s about to say.

I just say “yea, they are”. Then he says “I think you’re so incredibly brave for wearing shorts. That takes a lot of courage.” And I just thanked him.

I also smiled. I did more than smile. I cried. I started crying from the sheer gratefulness and gratitude I felt. I started crying because I never expected those words to come out of anyone’s mouth, let alone another high schoolers. I started crying because that meant so much to me. It made me feel so happy. It truly did. It made me feel like I wasn’t alone, and that not everyone will judge me. It made me feel proud, and not ashamed.

Tomorrow, I have a class with him, and I’m going to make sure that I thank him again, because he deserves it. 🤍"

A bit about me i am a stupid guy never been smart was fat as a kid. I work in connection. And this guy looks op to me!

Just want to say it told my mom she didn't care 
"
happy,"I just feel ecstatic this week full of pride for myself.  I grew up around alot of drugs and awful people, not awful in the sense that they did bad things but awful in the sense they had lost themselves in a pit of drugs and self depreciation.  My mom and my grandma were both addicted to opioid painkillers for like all of my childhood and I never knew my dad so my grandpa raised me and he was a great man he taught me alot of things a dad should like how to shave how to treat people and generally what it means to be a good person.  But nobody lives forever and when he passed things got worse and I was eventually taken by Arkansas CPS when i was 16 in late 2018 and given to my Great Grandma.  Lived with her for a bit then she decided she didn't want me and my oldest sister.  It hurt alot hearing someone just say they didn't want you when you expect them to care for you.  So I was placed in the foster system in January 2019 met lots of good people while I was in the system and I still talk to my foster mom.  I got out of the system in 2022 and left Kansas to come back home to Arkansas and I found myself surrounded by a whole new side of my family my mom had hidden from me my whole life, My Aunt Jamie and her wife Trey helped me get on my feet and my first place.  But me being new to this whole thing after about a year I lost a good job and in turn lost my place.  And then I met my Dad and he's just such a good person who's given me a firm guiding hand in the right direction which I exactly what I needed so now im an Assistant Manager at my local Dominoes and I plan on working here until September or November to say I have a year's worth of Management Experience then looking for a better paying job and this Saturday I'm moving into a new Apartment using all the money I've worked so hard for to save up and I'm just so happy and proud of myself.  And I'm thankful that I got to meet all this family I never knew cared so much about me for so long.  2025 is going to be my year, I hope to finally be able to really worm on myself and keep this winning streak going because this has been the best year or two of my life I'm happier than I've ever been and it's all thanks to my new friends and family. I'm learning to survive and I have to support system I need to finally make myself the person I want to be and I will never take it for granted. "
happy,"The last time I went to the beach was last year, I really miss the sand and the sound of the sea, it's like therapy for me, I hope to go again soon, it's something that's makes me super happy, here I'm manifesting my next beach trip "
happy," Last summer, there was a fat bumblebee hanging around in my neighbor's yard. My mom and I would talk to it whenever we went outside and he/she was there. The bumblebee would buzz towards us in a non-threatening way, back and forth, back and forth, almost dancing in a happy manner. This spring, another bumbly-bee is doing the same actions! This can't be the same bee (unless it's a queen?), but maybe said bumble passed the knowledge of me and mom being friendly.

I'm always happy to see the bumbly-bee when I go outside!"
happy,"It was just a passing comment during a phone call. To be honest, I kind of forgot I even mentioned it . Today I found a package on my doorstep.


Still can't figure out if it's a cat or a rabbit. There are two modes, rainbow and normal light. What should I name it?"
happy,"Just needed to get off my chest how happy I’m feeling rn in my relationship. We’re definitely not perfect but my fiancé tries really hard to make me happy and really listens and takes on board anything I have to say. It helps that he’s a complete lefty and the biggest feminist I know, we share all the same values and have the same morals. We’ve been together 3 and a half years now, I have a child with my ex husband and a child with my fiancé. He treats both kids and loves both kids the same, he’s a brilliant dad and I feel so lucky. 

My heart feels happy ♥️"
happy," I go to a university and I just started going to counseling there. I like counseling it gives me a chance to vent. Anyways Tuesday I will take the bus to school, go to my classes, after my classes I will have 3 and a half hours to kill so I will go to a movie at a movie theater two blocks from school, after the movie I will likely get something to eat and sit on my laptop until its time for my appointment, then I will go to my appointment and talk with the counselor about some issues. My sister said she can pick me up that night so no riding the bus for two hours that night! I will then get home and play my PS5 for a few hours then go to bed. I have only seen this counselor once so far but I am so looking forward to dumping more of my issues on her! "

happy,💗
happy,"I started a music project with two of my best friends a couple of years ago.  After releasing our first album I reached out to an author / reviewer to get feedback on what we'd put together.  I didn't get any feedback the first time around: this person was super busy so I didn't take any offence.  After releasing our second album I reached out again, still hopeful we'd get a listen.  It turns out this person liked our work quite a bit!  We got some very kind compliments.  I'm still smiling a day later. "
happy,"...Say Yes to the Dress! I've watched it before and it's always been a blast, but in the last two days I've been watching SYTTD Australia and Atlanta, and it's exactly what I need right now. So many happy and funny moments and it's just warm feeling to watch people embark on new incredible journeys, even when so much else feels like it's ending.

I love sharing joys and wins with people, and being able to do that with people I'll never meet is really filling a hole in my soul right now."
happy,"I can't believe I know how to play chess now. I always shunned it because I thought it required way too much thinking for it to be any kind of fun game, but now that I know how the pieces move, I feel like I can do a lot more intellectual things. Really, I learned how to play for two reasons: I quit two of my greatest addictions and really needed something new to occupy my mind. The other reason is because someone once asked me if I knew how to play chess, and it came off as them questioning my intelligence, and I didn't like that at all. So, now I finally know how to play and have so much more I can learn, which is great because I have so much time on my hands.

I'm having a blast! I can't believe I never took the time to learn this very great game. I'm so happy!"
happy,"This is what I came into. My inner child couldn't be happier, and I started happy jumping upon seeing kid you not.

happy,"It's been a long time coming. I haven't been able get more than a buzz for about four years now on account of how high my tolerance is. My lungs have begun to protest as well. I've had it in my mind for a while now that I need to take a lengthy tolerance break. Whenever my weed is about to run out I tell myself that this is it and that once it's gone I would begin a several month long break.

What always happens is I will smoke my last bowl and then find myself walking over to the dispensary that's literally a two minute walk away and buying another ounce. Last night I finished smoking my supply and I didn't buy more. I didn't buy any today either. The dispensary closes in 13 minutes and that will make it official.

For the first time in probably five years, I chose not to smoke weed. Tiny milestone, but tomorrow I will abstain again, and the next day, and the next, and the next."

happy,"i do some challenge to keep living. there’s a thing as “tell your family “i love you”

i never had a family and ppl i knew was very much toxic and wanted to control me VERY VERY much

so i say “i love you” to my friends, they my family. no matter if we talk every day, once at week or if i see them once at month

you all my family. and i say, we says “we loves you”

don’t know if it’s counts then, but “family” is someone who make me to feel safe, love and accept me. not someone who controls me, insults and makes me to cry

so, yeah, we love you all and we happy to say it "

Ten minutes ago we got a call indicating that it’s not.  I’m thrilled.  "
happy,"NSFW for mention of suicide 

This time last year I was lower than I've been. I remember having to pull my car over because I was crying so hard I couldn't see. I remember sitting with my loaded gun and the only thing that stopped me is kids often go to the park I was in. I remember trying to wreck into a semi after a particularly bad day. For years I was so depressed and so low I never imagined things could be this good. 

But now I wake up everyday overjoyed. I go to work and even though it's work I love it. I shower and I don't sit and cry. I ride with my windows down and sing along to my music and thank my God that I'm alive to see today. That I didn't opt out before I turned 18 like I thought I would. That I made it to 22 like I didn't believe I could. That I wake up today at 25 happier than I've ever been my entire life. I smile and I laugh and I love and I took control of what made my life so awful and kicked its ass until I had full control. 

I think back on all those years I spent unhappy and hating myself and harming myself and I wish I could talk to old me and tell her that it does get better. It takes a long time and alot of shit but you come out on top. 

25 is so young and my life is so full now and I just wanted someone to know. I'm just happy and that's all I've ever wanted and all I'll ever want. I'm just happy to be happy yall"

happy,"Around November of last year I (26F) matched with this guy(26M), he's honestly one of the sweetest guys I've met on a dating app. We were talking for a whole, but had to go out seprate ways, because he was unemployed then and looking for a job and had other things going on in his life. He felt like he couldn't give me time. Which was totally ok and understable. 

Anyway in one of our conversation where he was stressed about not getting a job, I remember giving him a pep talk, and he told me then that when he gets a job I'll be one of the first few people he'll tell. 

It's been around two months since we stopped talking and he texted me today that he got a hired! I'm also suprised that he remembered and texted me about his job. I'm so happy for him. In suprising turn off events in currently unemployed after leaving a toxic workspace and seeing him get a job, made me feel not so bad about my own unemployment. So to whoever is in the same boat. We got this! We'll get a good job that will make us happy."
happy,"Today marks 1 year of not experiencing a panic attack. 🥹 Mine were severe - included vomiting, heart irregularities, tremors, sweating, a fleeting feeling, and occasionally paralysis. I felt as though I would never be free of these, until I moved and surrounded myself with lovely, caring individuals. I have not had one since and I want to jump around in happiness. My mental health was declining a few years back and now I feel like it might be at its positive peak which I’m eternally grateful for. This past week especially I’ve felt an overwhelming sense of peace. Just wanted to post in case anyone else is suffering, I still get anxiety but from all the work ive done and being in the right place has helped so much and the anxiety is very minor. 🙌🏼💕"

This past 30 days have been the most motivated and passionate I’ve felt about anything I’ve ever done and truly feels good to know I finally have atleast tried. I couldn’t have forgiven myself for never atleast trying it and I guess now I can say I did. If anyone ever sees this whatever you are afraid to do, please don’t be and just do it. Do what you love because that’s what matters. I think a quote that randomly connects with this sentiment is one by Jim Carrey. summed up he pretty much said if you can fail at what you hate doing why not take the risk at what you love doing because atleast you are happy. "
happy," For some quick context I am an adult male. So to get right into what the title says. My whole life I always felt ""fat"" or ""ugly"". I'm not really sure what had convinced me to think this. I would not starve myself but would purposefully avoid meals or avoid drinking literally anything. This was the case for a good majority of my life so far (I'm 18 now just for reference). This train of thought, obviously damaged my self image, just leading to even more self conflicting issues. around the age of 15 I realized that I wasn't straight, turns out I was bisexual, (""great another reason to hate myself""). I felt even more isolated from others in my life. When I was 17, I accidently came out to my brother and step-mom, I remember going back to my room silently panicking, then venting to my best friend over text. The very next day my dad was joking around and said something like ""you saving yourself for that perfect girl....or BOY!?"" and I very stupidly said yes to both, realizing what I said made me internally panic again. To my surprise, my dad (who is Christian) was very very okay with it. For the days I almost began to cry on my way to school, due to the amount of weight lifted off of me. through the last remaining months of the year I felt like I was finally being accepted. To speed up this annoyingly long story, during the months leading up to and past my 18th birthday I was hit like a truck with a wave of sadness, tried something that I'm really happy it didn't workout, opened up to my step-mom and dad about it , got therapy, and processed my feelings healthily. This lasted for a 3-4 month period. Now in the year 2024 I still have my issues that I solve, but I have this underlying feeling of pure happiness that just sits dormant inside of me. I'm not sure if its an underlying issue problem of mine. Almost every time I go to take a shower I spot myself in the mirror (I'm usually fully clothed or just shirtless). I would stop and jokingly flex and check out myself (too clarify the mirror was only tall enough to show from above my head down and about to slightly above the waist), then proceed with my shower. Even today, I felt a surge of 5 am confidence and decided to open obs and take off my shirt and started to pose and check out myself out a bit and I thought in an exaggerated way ""omg I'm kinda... hot!"". Just being able to type this story out makes me feel so much appreciation for just life and how far I have progressed in my life. I know this sounds very cheesy, but I feel that if I were to meet younger self, my younger self would be very proud of us. I still feel random surges of sadness every now and then, but I usually break free from those episodes within the week. I can now confidently and proudly say that I'm happier now than I ever been in my ongoing life, and I know now that I'm not alone and I wont ever be. So as I go to end this embarrassingly long post, I want you, the reader to know you're loved and cared about. Sorry if this is hard to understand or if the grammar is a horror show to yall, I've been contemplating typing and posting this for a stupid amount of time and plus its almost 7 am. "
happy,Fitting for a family of hobbits.
happy,"It's been impossible for me (66F) to find anybody locally who knows enough about this to treat me, and the Mayo Clinic turned me down as a patient because I don't have the worse, more dangerous level of the disease, just the basic really shitty form of it.

I recently found out about Ketamine being used to treat chronic pain✅ trauma✅ depression✅ anxiety✅ *and this mast cell disease*✅, and five days ago I started on a daily microdose protocol. (The Ketamine works on the trauma *and* makes mast cells **calm TF down**, which helps the depression, anxiety, and pain, which will help calm down my nervous system, which will improve the mast cell symptoms, which include all of the above except the trauma.)

I didn't know what to expect because the disease makes my body think I'm allergic to virtually everything, but I haven't reacted noticeably to the drug at all. I haven't been optimistic at all about my future since my diagnosis, I'm so excited!"
happy,I live in Florida so pretty soon it’ll be too hot to spend entire days out here so we enjoy it when we can!!
happy," I go to a university and I just started going to counseling there. I like counseling it gives me a chance to vent. Anyways Tuesday I will take the bus to school, go to my classes, after my classes I will have 3 and a half hours to kill so I will go to a movie at a movie theater two blocks from school, after the movie I will likely get something to eat and sit on my laptop until its time for my appointment, then I will go to my appointment and talk with the counselor about some issues. My sister said she can pick me up that night so no riding the bus for two hours that night! I will then get home and play my PS5 for a few hours then go to bed. I have only seen this counselor once so far but I am so looking forward to dumping more of my issues on her! "
happy,"I have been with this amazing, amazing Turkish girl since the 17th of September last year, and she hasn't done anything but making me feel loved, happy, and very confident of my future. My Damla is very lively, and to my ears, she has the most beautiful laughter that I have ever heard.
I am very thankful for the night that we told each other the ""I love you"", and so thankful for her existance in my life."
happy,"Sorry for my bad english. I am a 23 year old guy, i work as a security guard in south america and live far from my family. I have an older sister (28 and works as a party organiser) and a younger brother (9 almost 10) who i love more than myself, i chat from time to time with my older sister since we both know the other is probably busy, on the other hand i play videogames with my brother almost every day and since he is young i play better than him (im not the best but i have been playing for many years now)we have tons of fun and he gets very sad when i have to leave, he joined my discord server along with my friends who are around my same age and he try to keep up with us as much as he can (i gifted him ""ForHonor"" and he is very good at it). Yesterday my older sister asked me about my pfp on discord (an ia image a friend made for me combining my gamertag ""turtle"" and a spacemarine from 40k) so i told her and she asked for the original picture, so i sent it to her along with some pther similar ones. When i sked what they were for she told me that our brother wanted a birthday party... and the theme was me... i expected a spiderman party or something like that. I cant belive how much that little guy loves me and looks up to me. He makes me the happyest brother."
happy,"I’m so excited. This is a job I’ve wanted for ages and I feel like people take me seriously and respect me professionally, which I’ve never really experienced as I’m still 20 and in college. 

I get to go to a new city I’ve never seen before, go to fancy dinners every night and get paid for it!! Also I feel like I’ve made my dad proud of me so that’s an added bonus. "
happy,"Growing up I was always in special education classes and have a real hard time learning. I was addicted to meth for 16 years and have been sober for 14. I started working at a treatment center in the kitchen, and never thought that I would ever have my own office able to help people struggling with substances. The thought of passing this test was so far-fetched. Anyway, on the 31st I passed my test and feel about 2 inches taller. And for somebody of my stature that’s a big deal lol I have been happy dancing all week. Now I have a career that I can provide for my 15-year-old son. Which I got full custody of when I was five years sober. Life is so good. If you’re struggling but doing the right thing, keep it up it pays off."
happy,"At 9:56 am today my boyfriend (m23) of 4 years and I (f21) both randomly  texted each other ""I love you ❤️"" while we were apart and it just made me smile. I was in my social work course watching a mock therapy group and one of the girls said her partner is her comfort person and I thought of him because he's mine. He told me that ""dreams"" by the cranberries was playing at his work (🥺) and it reminded him of me (omfg I'm winning). Life is funny and this just really reminded me that there are people who love you and think about you even when you're not around. "
happy,"I'm genderfluid and used to be FTM but decided to stop taking testosterone at the end of last year so my periods have been incredibly painful. 

In fact one of the many reasons I started to take it to begin with when I was 18 was years old and prior to that my period cramps were unbearable to the point I went to the hospital (probably due to low iron). 

My lover is an accomplished music producer and has a Dragon Ball cover song he's trying to wrap up for his audience on YouTube as soon as possible and while he's more than happy to have my company, he has to fully focus on his projecting order to meet his deadline. 

My time of month came in a few days ago and my cramps have been pretty intense, and he did have to experience having to see / hear me deal with all of the pain. 

So last night while he was focused and I was watching and episode of My Hero Academia he was letting his project play in the back ground, snuck behind me and started to give me the most amazing back rub in the universe. 

We already have such a wonderful and wholesome relationship but this made me feel so nice and relieved I wanted to post about it. His older brother is an RMT so his family definitely had some some of gene of being good with their hands when it comes to massages 🤤"
happy,"I recently did a purge of all negative thinking, embracing only positive thinking. And it's the most rewarding thing I ever did.

Being as reflective, critical, and analytical as I am, I hit some roadblocks that made me consider if I should balance the positivity with negativity for a complete perspective. But the results are in, from experience I can see that I live my best life when I'm positive minded, peaceful, healthy, drug-free smoke-free and alcohol-free, vegan, happy, kind, and compassionate.

I recommend a great book that helped me find this lifestyle called The Power by Rhonda Byrne. It's about the law of attraction and the power of love to put yourself on a frequency to receive happy things, events, people, and experiences.

The momentum just keeps building and I keep getting happier.

I also learned that life is easy this way! I used to thrive off the thrill of challenges and overcoming difficulties, but I'm even happier when everything is smooth and easy.

I'm looking to make friends who are also living the happy life, so feel free to DM me 🕊️"
happy,"Ever since I was a teenager I wanted a pair but they were always too expensive for me. My BF took the plunge and for my birthday (which is in a month, but he wanted me to get the most out of these boots during January lol) him and my best friends split the costs on the gift. They are in the box next to my bed as I'm typing this. I feel like a little child that got a very precious toy and can't sleep without hugging it. I almost ran up the wall when I first tried them on.

I wanted to share this here. I feel bougie and expensive with these Demonia boots lol"
happy,"My family and I were a bit worried about her.  She’s 12 and we found something on her paw that we thought might have been a tumor.

Ten minutes ago we got a call indicating that it’s not.  I’m thrilled.  "
happy,"I was scrolling through Reddit and came across a video of this tiny dog carrying an abnormally large stick, maybe even a branch in his mouth, waddling around with it as he tried to balance himself, it was absolutely adorable! I love dogs, man <3"
happy,Edit: Guys I’m blown away from the feedback. I wasn’t expecting this to get as much love as it did. I think it just goes to show that happiness can be simple and doesn’t require any extravagant justifications for sharing your feelings. r/happy is such a great community. 
happy,"I’m so excited! I’m currently about to book my flight to Tulum Mexico for a 5 day stay at the Temple Tulum so yeah I’m having all reasons to feel good right now despite all the shreds life had to throw my way recently! #happy!

happy,"I quit my job but now worried about money

Quit my job, but worried about money.

I had to do something very hard today. I had to quit my job. It was not a decision I took lightly. Unfortunately it was my first real job and it was sponsored by vocational rehab, which makes me feel bad about quitting. However, I need to prioritize my mental health. I am a 25 year old individual living with multiple disabilities including type 1 diabetes, adhd and anxiety. The job was causing me a lot of stress and anxiety. I spent 4 hours at the therapy office yesterday. They are also adjusting my anxiety medication, I’m still testing adhd meds. I would like to work but I’m not sure what I want to do. Sitting around and collecting disability is not an option. There has to be something im good at. Both my boss and vocational rehab are proud of me for prioritizing my mental health. However, I am still worried about money, despite the fact that I live with my parents. If I don’t work, I won’t be able to have an income. Money is a big stressor in my life. And I’m also trying to not feel like a failure. Maybe I can craft or sell something on etsy. Or freelance/gig work. There has to be something I’m good at. I’m just not sure what. My plan for now is to priorize my mental health, and I asked my therapy office if I was able to come in twice a week so we shall see what they say. I’m probably not the first one to quit my job due to stress. But I’m afraid I’m
The first one to quit their first job. Thank you for taking time to read this post. It was very hard for me to write."
happy,"My parents and grandparents gave me a surprise party for my birthday (not too far from now) and almost all my friends were there, including one that is like an older sister to me. They got me the best gifts I could ever ask for. I'm over the  moon and so grateful for them, and, honestly, I forgot the party was technically about me because I was busy thinking about them and how happy they've made me.

So, although this comes from a total stranger, you always have somebody who will come through for you. And if you don't yet, you will. There's always somebody."
happy,That's all.
happy,"Basically what the title says. I don't really have anyone else to share this with, but I feel quite accomplished. My story is basically growing up poor, a bunch of federal and private loans to get a degree (out of state, had to escape the crabs in that barrel), loan to get a decent vehicle, and then I got a job as far away as I could manage. Now, just shy of my 27th birthday, all of my loans are paid off right as my employer is paying to send me back to get a master's degree in my field (I start next term). It feels like I'm free, truly free, for the first time in my life. "
happy,My husband is on the path to the airlines which means we get to spend lots of Sunday afternoons flying around to get hours. Sedona is always spectacular 
happy,"I love reddit podcasts, but they can be so saddening, especially the stories about pulling ""pranks"" like lying about tragedies or physical harm. I love to do the complete opposite with my boyfriend, and last night was my favorite. He woke up yesterday and the first thing he said to me was ""I am craving white birthday cake."" so I figured, what's a birthday cake without a birthday party? Here's the prank... his birthday is in July. We gave him the ultimate surprise birthday party when he got off his mother's day restaurant shift."
happy,"I (30f) have been married to my wonderful husband for 4yrs and we dated for 2 before getting married. My in-laws have been wonderful to me the entire time. My FIL is like a second father and my MIL is like the mother I never had. Through the duration of my relationship with my husband, I have also been helping him heal his relationship with his parents, i.e making sure boundaries are maintained and communication lines remain open and honest whilst still being kind and considerate. 

My father suddenly passed away about a month ago and it's been really difficult as it was very unexpected but my husband, my friends and my inlaws have really rallied around and made sure I am okay. I've spoken to my husband and my inlaws and it has been decided that they will move in with us into my father's house to 1: help us with some bills and maintaining my father's property and 2: help them because they do not own the place they live now and will need some help as they are getting closer to retirement age. 

My FIL is disabled and on SSA benefits. I am also trying to get disability as I have not been able to work in almost 2 years due to a variety of health issues. My FIL has been so understanding and helpful with tips and tricks on how to do things around the house while chronically in pain or what processes are helpful in going through the disability thing. My MIL has been a real trooper through all of this and has helped keep me grounded as well. My husband is actually excited to live with his parents again because while I understand that his relationship with his parents is completely different than what I had with my dad, I don't want him to go through what I'm going through with any regrets and such. 

It just feels like a spotlight in a very dark time and I really love my husband and my in-laws. Even my brother in-law and future sister-in-law have been super amazing and accommodating and kind. I really love the family I married into and l hope they know I love them too."
happy,"Life update: you may remember me from this post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/b5p72v/comment/ejhehp6/](https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/b5p72v/comment/ejhehp6/)

But so many things have happened since then. You guys truly changed my life at that moment and I wouldn't have even gotten started without you guys. I've been picked up by a small but pretty successful publisher, DYB Publishing, for both my seven book fantasy series and science fiction trilogy.  I also went to my first anime convention last week and almost sold out (despite me almost dying from social anxiety). And I just wanted to come by and thank all of you! Also here are some pictures!

happy," I've been the happiest I've been for at least the past five years. No real complaints, no real worries. I mean, little day to day things like in a sitcom, but nothing crazy. I get up not worried about hating my job, don't think I have any real enemies, have a wonderful family and have the means to take care of them. Not religious either, so this is not fueled by my love for a higher being.

I found what makes me happy and don't really need anything else. Delighted to share my positive vibes if anyone needs some."
happy,"Over 2 years ago, a friend of ours passed away leaving 3 kids orphaned and a half sibling without a support system. My wife and I took in all 4 kids, as we were quite close with the kids. We got legal guardianship of the 2 youngest about 6 months after they moved in. The youngest is now 10. She started calling my wife ""Mommy"" about a year ago. This took some getting used to as all of our other kids call her ""Mom"". 

I however, remained Mr. MyFirstName. She has never had a dad before, and she had always called me that before she moved in. She gives me hugs everyday (now) and tells me she loves me frequently (yes, I know this won't last). So I was not worried about what she calls me. We went on a trip with my brother and his family, and sometime during the week, she just started calling me ""Daddy"". I'm not sure if it was because her cousin (my niece - 6F) calls my brother Daddy (a lot) or what caused it. At one point, we were at a theme park, and she was calling me Daddy over and over again, and I completely missed it, because I wasn't used to it and her voice is similar to my niece. My SIL grabs my arm and says ""Daddy!!!  Someone is calling you"". I felt awful, and so overjoyed at the same time. We've been home several days and I'm still Daddy (and getting used to it), but also Mr. MyFirstName sometimes too, but it still makes me smile.

  
We are hoping the adoption will be finalized this year. "
happy,"Quit my job

Recently quit my full time job. Was a good position and good pay but my manager went behind my back and basically just gave my position away and expected me to take the demotion purely because she was struggling at the other location and needed me back there to help. It was nothing to do with me or my work as I was really good at my job (don't mean to be bigheaded) but she allowed this other lady to introduce herself to all my colleagues as the manager of my location when they all know that i was there. 
I was really upset because it made it look like it was because I couldn't do my job and she completely broke any trust I had for her. I loved my job and I'm pretty upset BUT I stood up for myself and didn't stand for the lack of respect and told her where to go. I'm proud of myself for doing so and happy I'm no longer working under her. I'm confident I'll get a good job again that gives me the respect and decency I'm owed.

Just needed a lil rant lol don't mind me"
happy,"ive been on a lot of social apps (twitter, instagram, discord) but this is my first time really using reddit. like i would go to reddit before just for random advice (bc who doesnt trust random people on the internet) but no one told me reddit was a place i could just yap about anything but actually initiate good conversation with people that care about the same topic. best app ever "
happy,"I think I may have perfected my winged liner on slightly hooded eyes! And I tried out a purple liner which makes my brown eyes pop, especially the hazel and green flecks. Just super excited about it and wanted to share!"
happy,"To start off, im on mobile so excuse me if this is all over the place. I have known my boyfriend for a little over a year. I’ve always found the concept of “love at first sight” ridiculous, but let me tell you, something about him just kept reeling me in the moment i’ve laid eyes on him. We’ve had a very rocky relationship (more of a situationship for the most part), a lot of mistakes were made. We’ve hurt each other so many times, we kept trying to cut contact but we both just couldn’t stay away from each other. When we finally re-united for the last time this summer, we had a very open and honest conversation about everything that happened so far. Since then everything has just been perfect. I cannot tell you how perfect this man is. Of course we still have arguments or tense moments, but overall everyday of my life feels like the best day when he’s by my side. I would’ve never imagined that i would love another human being this much. He is the kindest, the most thoughtful soul i’ve ever met. I must admit, i can be a very childish and difficult person sometimes, however he is so so patient with me… More patient than i am with myself. I love him, i love him so much that it pours out of me. It pours on the way i view life, the way i view myself, onto my friends and family, onto strangers i cross paths with, onto everything. He makes everything so much better. I do not know if this is how love is or if it’s unhealthy, but i do know that i am so very greatful to have him in my life. I felt i had to share this to get it out of my chest, thank you if you’ve read all of this yappin’. 🫶🏻"
happy,Change is a bitch. 
happy,"Grew up in a small poor town in rural midwest. First of my family to go to college. I did two years of community college first while working at the mall and lived with parents, then I transferred to University and I only needed a loan for my final semester. That was in 2012. Not gonna lie, I was pretty much couch surfing/homeless til 2014 where I decided to learn programming (my major in college was history, what a waste of time).

Got my big break in 2015, but still living on the edge and needed roommates until 2019. In 2022 I joined a tech startup which I am still working at. I have zero debt outside of a mortgage (got a house at 3% in 2022 whew!), and have savings of a bit over $500k thanks to some smart investing. I got married in 2019 and have a daughter, and life is pretty good as I get to work from home and my wife doesn't have to work. My hours are flexible at work as well as long as I get my tasks done, that's all they care about. No set hours.

After expenses we have about $3k left over every month to invest or do something fun with.

I am pretty happy. Hopefully it lasts."
happy,"I'm an artist in NYC and the last several months have been brutally slow. After a lot of exhausting work, and serious anxiety about what they would say, not 1 but both people who reached out to me said they were going through with their purchases!!!

happy,"Today I turned 33.  My boyfriend (33M) decided to take me on a small trip to a forest an hour away that he knows is one of my favourite places. 
Things were weird between us the the last couples of weeks but I was happy that we took the trip.
We walked through the woods and I was walking ahead of him and he called out my name. I asked him whatif everything is okay while still looking straight ahead. He asked me to turn around. There he was, holding a ring in his hands, smiling at me and he popped the question. 
I said yes. 
I still can't believe it happened .
I can't believe I'm saying this but I'm engaged and this is most definitely the best birthday I've ever had."
happy,"It looks like no big thing, normal achievements for most people, but 2 years ago I was depressed, no job, no money, no friends, single, my mental health wasn't good at all. Now I'm working, I have a job, I met a girl that I really like, she became my girlfriend, and I started to work out, I've gained a few pounds, my physique looks better now.

I'm really proud of myself and feeling happy. I felt like sharing it because depressed people can change their life for the better, it's not easy but it's possible!"
happy,"ljust need to let this out to some one but I'm finally happy in a relationship, my last one was exhausting and it was to the point that my new S/0 was confused why was so happy when she came into the store with me. I also almost cried when the first time I was at work and she stayed at my place she had cleaned the entire place just cuz, no one has ever done that and it ment so much to me,It just feels like such a great weight off my shoulders and made me feel something I've never felt before. I can't wait to take her on her first vacay in Sept to show how much she means to me and to spend time with he in Disney. 

Also wanted to let people know that love is out there, if this woman can love a 23 year old autistic guy with 10k in Legos, then there is hope for everyone out there."

moral of the story: fake date your friend whos knows what will happen 🤭"
happy,I was able to buy the house mostly using money my mother left after she passed away.  And I think she'd be proud and happy knowing the hard work she put in while she was alive helped give me a new chance.  She always wanted me to live happy and now I am.

I’ve paid off all my credit cards and have finally started saving — saving! I’m at my goal weight and I look and feel amazing. I have a gorgeous apartment that I get to decorate however I want; and since my tax return was huge then I actually have the money to do it!

For the first time in my life I only have ONE job, and it’s remote! 

The weather is glorious, my dog is the best ever, I have great friends, my plants are thriving, I love spending time with myself, and I’m even drinking less! 

Thanks for listening Internet strangers, it always feel like too much to brag to friends and family when you’re feeling this good! "
happy,"my boyfriend and i are both 16. were immature, sometimes a little petty, but undoubtedly in love. my mother died before i met him, but since he’s known me he’s supported me through the grief of losing her and even has visited her grave by himself on his own time. he helps me talk about her, and says that he wishes he could have known her. it means more than he knows.

i come from a drug addict mother and angry father, so my model for a relationship wasn’t the best. i’ve messed up with him, i’ve said things i didn’t mean when i was upset, but he’s been nothing but patient with me. he’s taught me how to talk things out and admit when i’m upset about something, and to not harbor my emotions.

he’s making me a better person, and i love him unconditionally. he’s the first person i’ve been comfortable enough to let him see every single side of me, mentally and behaviorally. anyways, just wanted to say there are still good people out there, and everyone deserves someone who treats them the way my boyfriend treats me!! "
happy,"What's so special about an office snack drawer?

It sounds funny but I have dreamed of having my own snack drawer at my own desk in my own office for as long as I can remember.  While I may not have my own office, I have a nice cubicle next to a large set of windows in the corner of the building.  It's wonderful!

I spent the better part of a decade getting an undergraduate engineering degree and graduated at 33 while working to support myself and doing extracurricular projects.  There were so many times I just wanted to quit.  I moved around a lot and changed majors at one point so it took a while to get through it all but I did it.  I now work for a company that I've always wanted to work for and I have myself a snack drawer.

It's silly but this snack drawer reminds me of all the blood, sweat, and tears that went into getting my degree and I just feel so accomplished when I turn around, open it, and grab some crackers.  I've come so far since I was waiting tables with no direction in life and it's a nice reminder that all the hard work paid off.  I can't help but smile when I think about it.  Lmao, sounds so weird typing it out but it makes me so happy!"
happy,"
At school I hated working, would much rather be playing sports or video games. Throughout uni whilst I found some topics interesting, I hated any hard graft, would much rather be lounging about. I had kind of just accepted that I would forever just do my job to get paid then rush home at the end of the day. 

My first couple jobs were very much like that. I was there for a pay check, would not spend a second more than I needed to there. 

I’ve just had an incredibly busy/tiring/stressful week, and as I sit slumped on the sofa watching a film I find myself somewhat looking forward to Monday and to getting stuck right back into it? This is a completely alien concept for me and I’m not sure how to process it. I’m incredibly thankful and I just kind of wanted to get it off my chest without appearing like bragging to my friends. 

A) what do I do with this good energy? Do I just accept that I’m lucky and crack on?

B) I wanna hear about others that love their job- not the money or how easy it is, who really loves putting in effort and showing up Monday morning? And to those people how do I stay like this? I don’t want to get burned out I want to be happy going to work when I’m 60"
happy,"I’ve been overweight for my entire life, and finally started trying to lose weight in a sustainable way back in December. As of this morning, I have lost 15 pounds! 

I have had trichotillomania (compulsive hair pulling, related to OCD and anxiety) for fifteen years. As of this morning, I have gone THREE DAYS without pulling! 

I’m a high school teacher, and this morning (after a pretty tough year), I found out that I get to teach my dream class next year!

I don’t have a lot of people to tell, but it was a really good day :) "

happy,"This morning I was walking around my apartment and my feet were cold from the tile floor. This was annoying until I realized that this meant my feet’s nerves were working again 🥳🥳🥳🥳. 

This is the first time this year it’s been cold where I live, so I’m not sure how long I have been able to feel the bottom of my feet for. Maybe it came back slowly and I just didn’t notice?

So what happened was several years ago I lost the feeling on the bottom of my feet and toes from wearing high heels for sorority recruitment. I was wearing high heels on concrete for 6 days around 10 hours a day and since I’m tall I had to stand in the back and jump nonstop every time girls were entering or leaving our sorority house.

After a few months the feeling returned to my toes but not the pads of the bottom of my feet. I had seen several specialists and they said pretty much there’s nothing we could do except wait and hope the nerves came back. After a couple of years I didn’t think they would ever come back.

I do not know how it is possible that the nerves could repair themselves years later. But they’re definitely back. I used my finger nail on the bottom of my feet and I can feel it so it isn’t just temperature I can feel 🥳🥳🥳

My feet now feel super tingly from the cold so I think they’re just having to readjust to being able to feel again or something but I’m so excited🥳🥳🥳"
happy,"I have two beautiful kids that I love dearly and they are both my bonus children. My husband made an appointment for tomorrow to start the ball rolling on reversing his vasectomy. 

When we met he told me he didn’t really believe in marriage and he already had his children. I said I was fine with that, and I was. But time has passed and we’ve moved together and grown together. He tells me I’m the best mother he’s ever seen, that I deserve my own and that he desperately wants it too. Our kids ask us constantly when we’re going to have a baby. Hopefully we can answer that soon. 

Send us some baby dust on this Valentine’s Day. 🫶🏼"
happy,"It's been a long journey with a lot of ups and downs, but I've finally found myself a job I can manage with hours that work for me despite my disability - and I thought I was doing ok, but it turns out I've been doing great! I work in health care and it's really important to me that my patients feel cared for and respected, so I'm overjoyed that I've apparently got so much positive feedback from my patients, as well as the other medical staff I work with. I'm not naturally a ""people person"" so it's pretty exhausting putting on my mask for every person who walks through my door, but this makes it feel worthwhile. 

To everyone who worries that they'll never be able to manage in the workplace, don't lose hope! When you're ready, keep searching and the right job could come along when you least expect it. I was struggling so much after years of trying to survive in the workplace that I ended up on a disability pension, deemed unable to work at all. Now I do five mornings a week, which isn't a lot by ""normal people"" standards, but I'm proud that I've made it this far. It's not the job I dreamed of doing and it isn't prestigious or glamorous but it's important work that I'm providing to the community. Everyone has something they can offer to the world, for some of us it just takes longer to find it. "
happy,"I just got the best news!!!

After months of waiting, many tests, background checks and a fun 4 hour long psych eval with even more tests involved…

I got offered a job as a County Detention Deputy!!!!

It’s almost double the yearly salary I have been getting for the last few years!

This is fantastic news!!!!"
happy,First week of college my girlfriend broke up with me because she wanted to hookup with a guy she met in class after begging me to come to college with her and being in a relationship with her for a year she successfully hooked up with him and kept me on the ropes for 7 whole months and I developed a pill addiction and asked her for help with it but she didn’t care a month ago I ended things with her it was then she realized she threw me away and took me for granted for that long and wants me back but I know after what she did to me I can’t go back it’s been a month now and I’m very happy I’m talking to a new lady rn and things are going good but why do I feel guilty ending things with her ?
happy,"Is it girl math when you're on your weight loss journey and you're down 2-3 dress sizes so you have to buy new clothes but it's okay cos smaller clothes are cheaper than plus size anyway?

Oh who cares! I'm down almost 3 dress sizes!! I'm doing AMAZING!

THE ONLY WAY IS DOWN!! 🥳"
happy,I've been using a Couch to 5k app that uses progressive overload to help you run a 5k. My mental health has been tanking so working out for MYSELF hits different. Potential weightloss a huge benefit. Anyways. Super proud of myself after being a potato for the last few years! 🥰😀

happy,"2 years ago, my partner worked at Habitat for Humanity as a family coordinator, where she would help families apply, understand the criteria, and screen families for eligibility. There was a lovely immigrant family of 4, a mom, dad, teenage son, and younger daughter who were incredibly sweet and hardworking. The problem was that they applied 4 times, and each time, they either had just the smallest bit over income or they were not selected. My partner saw how hard working they were and how much this would turn their life around. They lived in a small 1 bedroom apartment and spending way too much on rent.  On the 5th application, my partner made sure that everything was correct, they were eligible, and she went to bat for them during committee selections, ensuring they got a house this time. They talked so often throughout the process and the mom called my partner her “daughter”, that is how close they became. Then one day, my partner gets home and tells me that this family got approved to get a new house after 2 years of rejections. I was floored with emotions as I had become so invested in their wellbeing. 

Now, my partner was the one that would be calling and letting the families know that they would be eligible to receive a home. I was so invested in this family that I made sure to listen to the phone call that she made to the mom of the family on speakerphone. As soon as she called, the mom thought something else was wrong and she didn’t get a home this round. Instead, my partner broke the news that they would be getting a house. That was when I immediately started balling my eyes out. I’m crying, my partner is crying, and the mom was crying.  It’s really hard to describe the amount of love the mom had for my partner and the gratitude she had for my partner doing everything she could to get them a home. I cried for a long time, even after they hung up. I’ve never felt so happy for someone else being so happy. To this day, when I think about that phone call, I tear up and could cry just like that day. I’ve never cried from happiness this way for anyone. As I write this, my eyes fill with tears thinking back to that beautiful moment. 

Later, the mom brought my partner a whole cake and other expressions of gratitude. It’s a moment that will stay with me for the rest of my life. Today, this family is thriving more than they ever have and we keep up with them. "
happy,Cheers!
happy,"Howdy! 

I'm so appreciative of all of y'all's support! I was worried if I was overstaying my welcome on this sub, but y'all were so supportive! For anyone starting their fitness journey from my posts, or anyone who is in their own fitness journey, I'm so proud of you! I'd like to address a couple thing so constantly see in the replies. I'd rather address it on the post instead of individual comments. 

I do infact know I need a calorie deficit to lost consistent weight, and I've been on a calorie deficit since day 2

No, this is not a karma farm. Anyone who values karma so much they lie and take advantage of peoples kindness is an idiot. If you still believe this is a karma farm, that's fine but please don't be rude to or others who just want to improve their lives.

Yes, I know I'm fat, I know I'm unhealthy, you don't need to constantly spam in in the replies. Please come up with more insults because I'm running out of jokes. 

Sorry for the long post but I hope y'all have a great day, Cheers!"
happy,"For context I’ve always wanted to do content creation like YouTube and streaming mainly streaming and I finally have started officially 30 days ago streaming everyday. This past 30 days have been the most motivated and passionate I’ve felt about anything I’ve ever done and truly feels good to know I finally have atleast tried. I couldn’t have forgiven myself for never atleast trying it and I guess now I can say I did. If anyone ever sees this whatever you are afraid to do, please don’t be and just do it. Do what you love because that’s what matters. I think a quote that randomly connects with this sentiment is one by Jim Carrey. summed up he pretty much said if you can fail at what you hate doing why not take the risk at what you love doing because atleast you are happy.

happy,"I was born in the early 80's and I have been obsessed with The Gremlins ever since it was released. I told my husband I begged my parents for Spike from the movie for 3 years in a row when I was younger. Of course, that wasn't a possibility, but it didn't quite sink in until I was older. I opened a specialty toy set with a large Spike Gremlin and a little Gizmo yesterday; it arrived a bit late due to the first one getting lost in the mail and major shipping delays for the replacement. It was such a nice surprise during the cold snap here and the first weekend of Dry January."

happy,"To all my fellow singles out there and to those that are missing/can’t be with their significant other today, remember this:

You have the ability to light your own spark.  We all want that sense of completion with someone else by our side.  We all fantasize about being whole.  The over-commercialization of romantic love makes it even worse. The truth is, we are whole just as we are.  Sure we all come with baggage but that doesn’t make us incomplete.  This is your reminder that you don’t have to go through today feeling alone.  This is your chance to pour all of your love into the most important person in your life: you!

Right now, I’m sitting with a glass of my favorite (Verdi) wine, snuggling with Bruno the stuffed red dragon and my two cats.  I bought myself flowers again this year and added the purple rose because they are my favorite.  I lit my favorite Apotheke candle.  There’s salmon broiling in the oven that I’ll be pairing with  broccoli and basmati rice.  Later, I’ll cuddle under the blankets and watch a movie.  It’s all I’d want to do with a partner.  Why should being single change that?

How are you spending today?  I hope it is filled with peace and not a reminder of what could have/should have been.  Seize your happiness.  You deserve it."
happy,Met my bestfriends girlfriend and when we were alone for a little bit she told me “he talks about you all the time and it’s really obvious you mean so much to him and he looks up to you. i’m really glad he has you he needs you”. It just felt so damn good man. Usually it’s people talking bad behind your back but he is praising me to his GIRLFRIEND. I feel so loved man.
happy,"I know this sounds silly. 

But my friend is going through a bad divorce. He's been abused for 30 years by a wack job. He got kicked out of his place, and I offered my couch. 

We're sitting on my bed, watching a movie, and high. He has had a terrible day, so I'm trying to make it better. I noticed he took a picture of a gift I got him and posted it to a Reddit sub. 

I asked what he was doing, and he got so excited. He told me he was in this nice sub and everyone is so welcoming, that his post got 700 karma. He is very, very new to this app and is older, so he's not up to snuff with everything. 

But he just lit up when he showed me how excited he was that people were talking to him and that they liked his post so much that he got ""a little karma"" 

This man has cried his eyes out for hours tonight; seeing him beam about something so small just filled my heart. I'm overjoyed to see him this excited! 

Anyway, I just, really want this man to be happy, so for this small thing to really bring him joy just makes my chest burn.

Edit: 

If you all want to give him some love I'll link his art post. It'll make him very excited that people enjoy his art. He only ever shares it within his work space. Not sure why but I think it'll get him excited.

happy,"I came out to my parents about being non binary (AFAB) when I was 16, I've known it since I was 15 and rn I'm 20. So it's been a long time and I'm quite sure of myself about who I am and how I feel.
A few years ago my mom kept telling me that it was a phase and my dad even told me that I was just following a trend that that if I ever did anything to make my body appear less feminine then he wonnt consider me his child anymore... Other than that everything was great in my life.

But now my parents are suddenly trying to accept me!
I have no idea what changed but today my mom came to my room to give me some of my dad's old clothes, we're going to attend a wedding soon so I needed good clothes for that, and she gave me my dad's old suit!
I was so happy that for the first time she didn't ask me to wear a dress, and my dad accepted to lend me his old clothes for a formal event without trying to convince me to wear something else first😁😁😁
And when I tried everything on my mom looked at me and I could see all the love in her eyes and she just said ''you're becoming a beautiful person''
I almost cried, I'm french so we have a very binary language and she used the word joli/jolie which means beautiful but it sounds the same way no matter if it's masculine or feminine (unlike beau/belle), and she said person and not young woman as she usually did

I'M SO HAPPY 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
They're both 50+ and they're actually trying to change how they acted and how they were raised (like considering anything LGBT+ just a young people trend) to accept me as me 🥰 I love them so much and I just want to share that joy with everyone and anyone right now 🥳❤️"

1. Kept real friends who actually care 
2. Stopped surrounding myself with sad stuff, like certain .. communities 
3. Go outside more. Work out 
4. This is a bit ironic because I met someone amazing on here but stopped talking to those random redditors lol, they’re usually a mess. No offence 
5. USE LESS SOCIAL MEDIA. Huge part
6. Enjoy my hobbies

happy,"To start off, im on mobile so excuse me if this is all over the place. I have known my boyfriend for a little over a year. I’ve always found the concept of “love at first sight” ridiculous, but let me tell you, something about him just kept reeling me in the moment i’ve laid eyes on him. We’ve had a very rocky relationship (more of a situationship for the most part), a lot of mistakes were made. We’ve hurt each other so many times, we kept trying to cut contact but we both just couldn’t stay away from each other. When we finally re-united for the last time this summer, we had a very open and honest conversation about everything that happened so far. Since then everything has just been perfect. I cannot tell you how perfect this man is. Of course we still have arguments or tense moments, but overall everyday of my life feels like the best day when he’s by my side. I would’ve never imagined that i would love another human being this much. He is the kindest, the most thoughtful soul i’ve ever met. I must admit, i can be a very childish and difficult person sometimes, however he is so so patient with me… More patient than i am with myself. I love him, i love him so much that it pours out of me. It pours on the way i view life, the way i view myself, onto my friends and family, onto strangers i cross paths with, onto everything. He makes everything so much better. I do not know if this is how love is or if it’s unhealthy, but i do know that i am so very greatful to have him in my life. I felt i had to share this to get it out of my chest, thank you if you’ve read all of this yappin’. 🫶🏻"

My parents don’t love me and haven’t for a long time and I’m happy with that. Recently, my parents have shown their true colors to a lot of people, especially me. I’ve come to learn that they have only loved me conditionally, if I provide something to them. They weaponize my siblings against me, try to financially cripple me, and just try to make me feel as bad as possible. Ever since I’ve been sure of what I wanna do for a career, my mother and sister have constantly belittled it. My mother has said that my sister is her favorite and my parents have always shown that for as long as I can remember. I realize now that they don’t love me anymore and I’m happy I can move on with my life. I’ve accepted that they never will for as long as I live, and I can finally grow and surround myself with people who truly love and care about me. "

I got very happy because it showed that they felt good about getting complimentes for something small, and said it to me. This is something that is (was) not normal in my family."
happy,"Lately I've been into collage thanks to the algorithm making me watch videos of scrapbooking and journaling. I've never been good with handmade stuff and I'm very conscious of it because I've never been ""excellent"" with that type of stuff. But that videos are really nice to watch and I keep thinking I want to do it too.

As soon as I told my husband that I wanted to try it he lent me his account for buying the materials even though we're on a tight budget (I had surgery recently because of a broken bone in my left hand). He never said ""You can't do it"", ""You aren't good with those things"", ""You only do it because of the videos"" or other stupid things I thought when I decided to tell him I wanted to try it. He even said it was nice because I could do it as rehab for my hand... It's been a week since then and he's following our orders and even helping me do my first collages because there's some things I still can't do with my hand.

I was afraid that as I finished my first one he would notice I'm terrible at it and maybe he would be mad for spending that money but quite the contrary he said it looked good and encouraged me to keep going.

He's not only aknowledging my desire to try a new hobby as valid but also he's giving me courage to challenge myself in things I always felt unsuited for.

 I'm really thankful for him..."
happy,"today i got in a car accident. i wasn't doing well lately and that car accident and the headache made me go in deep episode of depression. 

later i found myself in a ai image generator. i asked it to make one of my happiest days in the not so happy life of mine. and you know what? it didn't disappoint me.

this is a date i had with my love of life. it was beautiful day. i wore red polo shirt that she gave me in my birthday (she is one of 2 people who cares about my birthday) and she wore this outfit (pink skirt, white shir, pink hijab) that she wore in the day that i started loving her. before that we used to be friends, and we spoke a lot. i used to think of her as the coolest girl out there. and she thought of me like this as well (yes i said cool, yes we were young and yes i still do think of her as the coolest girl out ther). one day we decide to meet, i went to to that location, when i saw her from a distance and she smiled at me from far, wearing this outfit it i fall in love, 

we met to give her her birthday present (black hijab from the type she loves so much but she didn't have a black one, and inside of it i put a kindder surprise as a extra surprise for later).

so later in the relationship after i confessed and growing together loving each other more and more, we met in one of our walk dates (dates is kinnda illegal here) i wore this shirt that she gave me and a bracelet that she made for me before my confession (really sweet gift), and she wore my favorite outfit she had (she knows how to make me happy).

in this date we hold hands for the first time ever. we have been loving each other for over a year and half by now. (i know it may be something alien to most of you but we live in different place with different rules.)

so this is a small part of our story. it made me happy to remember these days even with all of my cournt problems.


thank you for reading. i hope you have a happy day as well <3"

happy,"I didn’t want cats. But these two little guys are here now and I’m so glad they are. 

My older one was a bony 6-month-old stray last winter that begged my mom for help, he demanded attention. He wanted love so much that the thought of sending him to a shelter where he’d be alone in a cage broke my heart, so I took him in. My younger one was a 1-2-month-old kitten who went on an adventure. She climbed into my roommate’s fiancée’s car while she was delivering food in a trailer park and wouldn’t leave. She took the kitten home, but her dog didn’t get along with it. Based on how she described the kitten, I again couldn’t send it to the shelter, so I took her in. 

Both live with me in my college apartment. It took some adjusting for them, but it was worth it. They’re best friends now, I love seeing them together. They play fight constantly, I can tell my older one is holding back and my younger one is learning how to catch him off guard. They love to eat at the same time as well. The older one always sleeps right by me and the younger tends to sleep on the ground or in the cat tree. When I wake up in the morning, they’ll both wake up too, and and younger one will always hop up on my bed purring and immediately go touch noses with my older one. 

We had to travel back home for Christmas, my older one has bad separation anxiety and he would’ve been alone for a couple days so I took both of them. They were stressed in their new environment. So when we went to bed, they cuddled with each other, paws on one another for comfort and support. 

I’m so glad I’ve been able to provide them a good home. Watching them grow up has been an honor. From putting their first collars on them to seeing my kitten see snow for the first time, there’s so much to smile about. They’ve got so much time to spend with each other, I’m looking forward to it. I’m glad I’ve not only been able to give them a home, but that I’ve given them siblings and best friends, another cat that they can trust and play with."

I understand that PT school isn't the best financial decision for most people, but I did accept my offer at a relatively cheap school.

Before this year, I never showed up to course events, social events, nothing - I thought that cliques had already formed and it was way too late. 

This year, I challenged myself by going to events, and I found that people weren’t as closed off as I thought they’d be. 

I’m finally being invited to parties and karaoke nights, etc., I feel like I’m a part of a group in a way I never have been before.  

I’m so proud of myself for going out of my comfort zone and being confident as I could.

happy,"Hi, Everyone.

I was going to wait a week, but I had to create an account and post this because I’m just too happy to keep it inside anymore.

A few days ago, my wife posted on this board. She was having a tough time sleeping, and in the middle of this rough night, the thought of something I did brought a smile to her face. She shared that moment with everyone here, and in response, the amount of goodwill and kindness that flowed from this community was overwhelming. 

She kept this post secret from me—never expecting it to make other than a few people smile. Little did she know, it would gain a ton of traction. The generosity and support that followed made it tough for her to conceal, and eventually, she showed me the thought that made her so happy this past Monday at 3 A.M..

My wife is amazing. I’m so happy, lucky, and fortunate to be in that group of people who have truly found their soulmate. My heart becomes full just thinking about her, and sometimes I just say her name randomly because it makes me happy to hear. I love her so much, and I can’t stop smiling right now.

I also want to take a moment to thank everyone in this community. What you all did truly shows the amazing types of people you are. From the messages of encouragement, to the acts of support, it’s a been such a joy. I’ll never forget any of it, and when I called my mother to tell her about what everyone here did, it seriously made her day.

Thank you all so much. You made my wife happy. You made my mom happy. For that, I will forever be grateful, and I promise to do my best to spread all the positive energy you gave us back out into the world.

This truly is the bright center of the Internet."

happy,"I cleaned my house after living in a pretty big mess after 2 years. For context: I live with my mom and grandpa. my mom is a hoarder and also battles manic depression so she buys a lot of things to comfort herself (not hoarders tv show level but clothes, shoes, journals, pens, books). My grandpa hoards food (not sure why) and doesn’t like to get rid of anything even if it’s expired from 2019. I also can be messy and not put things back where they go. I spent a year being mad that I had to clean the place at all because I felt like I shouldn’t have to clean up after perfectly capable people and I knew they wouldn’t make an effort to keep it clean. I guess I got over that last week because I cleaned the entire house and had about 6 garbage bags full of things to throw out that hadn’t been used in years. What really prompted the clean was my mom essentially went to stay with her sister and didn’t give me any warning or anything. I guess I felt like if the house was clean she’d come back home. This was a super long rant but anyway I’m just proud of myself that I have continued the efforts of keeping the house clean and putting things back where they go even if my grandpa and mom don’t contribute because I realized if I want the house to stay clean, it’s going to have to be me doing the clean up.

happy,"Recently I suffered an accident at a grappling competition. Large fracture on my right leg and 2 smaller ones near the ankle. 

&#x200B;

You would think this is a extremely low point in my life to get such a crippling injury, well you would be quite wrong. Part of is perhaps that in the end I will make a full recovery after a few months so I would be left in the end with just the humbling experience and the attitude that people now have with me.

&#x200B;

I used to think my friends are only friends with me because I am to use of them and because we have similar hobbies where we train together. Used to think I was the after thought of my family as the middle child. My feelings were always less important than my sisters, I was always supposed to support them if something happened but it never felt like it was given back.

&#x200B;

Well not only has my family offered help to even moving in with me to help me out and interrupting their lives to do so, not only have my friends all offered to drive me to the hospital and come to my place to play board games and entertain me, and even offering to do my university work but even random strangers on the street stopping their cars and asking me where am I headed and to drive me home. Old women offering to carry my bag and even the meanest looking face tattoo dudes offering help without even being asked or remotely needed.

&#x200B;

I am a 23 year old dude, used to feel alone in the world where nobody would care if something happened to me to now feel like society actually cares. Ofcourse Ive had a negative experience too but positive experience outweighs easily the one bad experience. To the people that are like the ones that help, thank you, you have no idea how much you help. I certainly would strive to become more like the selfless people that helped me when I fully recover. And dont judge the mean looking people by appearance, maybe thats how people also viewed me before, they turn out to be the most sympathetic of them all."
happy,"Grew up in a small poor town in rural midwest. First of my family to go to college. I did two years of community college first while working at the mall and lived with parents, then I transferred to University and I only needed a loan for my final semester. That was in 2012. Not gonna lie, I was pretty much couch surfing/homeless til 2014 where I decided to learn programming (my major in college was history, what a waste of time).

Got my big break in 2015, but still living on the edge and needed roommates until 2019. In 2022 I joined a tech startup which I am still working at. I have zero debt outside of a mortgage (got a house at 3% in 2022 whew!), and have savings of a bit over $500k thanks to some smart investing. I got married in 2019 and have a daughter, and life is pretty good as I get to work from home and my wife doesn't have to work. My hours are flexible at work as well as long as I get my tasks done, that's all they care about. No set hours.

After expenses we have about $3k left over every month to invest or do something fun with.

I am pretty happy. Hopefully it lasts."

They are also both super healthy and workout regularly which is really impressive to me and has motivated me to get off my ass! lol  We even signed up for a hot yoga class this weekend! 🧘‍♀️

We were all texting last night saying how we felt we were supposed to meet one another. Just makes me feel grateful for being able to meet new friends at 43 and especially at a time when my heart is missing who I thought was my person so much.

happy,"“How is her brother doing?”

Weird, right? Ill make it make sense!

My best friend passed away 2 years ago, we have guardianship of her 17f daughter, and are active in her 18transM’s son’s life. We’ll call him K.

I have boomer parents. I would gently correct them when they referred to the kids as “the girls,” or used the incorrect pronouns for K. I was understanding that they were going to mess up here and there because of the generational gap, but figured after consistent gentle corrections, they would get there sooner than later.

I was wrong. After nearly 2 years, I felt I gave them more than enough grace to get it right. My mom has been the main culprit of the two because she always wants to talk about the kids, while my dad never really asked/talked about them as often (man of few words type). I started getting more aggravated and upset every time my mom would ask “how are the girls doing?” After 2 years, I just felt like my parents just didn’t care enough to even try to understand. I stopped bringing the kids around my family because I felt like it was always a negative experience for them, and refused to subject them to that kind of environment.

Fast forward to last week: I was talking to my dad on the phone. He was asking about 17f because I had mentioned she was starting school again soon and she just had a birthday. After we were done talking about her, he said the sentence:

“How is her brother doing?”

0 coaching. No correcting. Just him using his own words. 

I couldn’t believe it and actually stuttered a bit after that one sentence. That was the first time I heard one of my parents affirm his gender identity. 

My dad does care and has been listening. My heart exploded. I had hella tears.

I love my dad and am happy."

I’ve probably done over twenty or thirty paintings this year of varying sizes and this was after YEARS of doing maybe just less than a handful. I think last year I did two or three. Prior to this year I was making friends who didn’t even know I was a painter or went to school for art. I’m proud to say that narrative has vastly shifted!

Anyways, today i took my brother to the dispensary. It was his first time and i said it was on me. I got home and i felt so good i just wanted to share. 

Ive always wanted to cross of my bucket list have a first experience with one of my siblings. I know thats a odd experience but the way my brother was excited to go with me was so filling. It was just the fact that we got to enjoy a shared interest. although i do not condone drug use if it is illegal in your state, like i said, sharing a similar interest together was great. He even said “Next time i get paid, it’s on me.” 

Today was great. I feel so whole again. My heart feels so light for the first time in years and im just so excited to enjoy more things in life after feeling so low for such a long time.

This past 30 days have been the most motivated and passionate I’ve felt about anything I’ve ever done and truly feels good to know I finally have atleast tried. I couldn’t have forgiven myself for never atleast trying it and I guess now I can say I did. If anyone ever sees this whatever you are afraid to do, please don’t be and just do it. Do what you love because that’s what matters. I think a quote that randomly connects with this sentiment is one by Jim Carrey. summed up he pretty much said if you can fail at what you hate doing why not take the risk at what you love doing because atleast you are happy. "
happy,"Grew up in a small poor town in rural midwest. First of my family to go to college. I did two years of community college first while working at the mall and lived with parents, then I transferred to University and I only needed a loan for my final semester. That was in 2012. Not gonna lie, I was pretty much couch surfing/homeless til 2014 where I decided to learn programming (my major in college was history, what a waste of time).

Got my big break in 2015, but still living on the edge and needed roommates until 2019. In 2022 I joined a tech startup which I am still working at. I have zero debt outside of a mortgage (got a house at 3% in 2022 whew!), and have savings of a bit over $500k thanks to some smart investing. I got married in 2019 and have a daughter, and life is pretty good as I get to work from home and my wife doesn't have to work. My hours are flexible at work as well as long as I get my tasks done, that's all they care about. No set hours.

After expenses we have about $3k left over every month to invest or do something fun with.

I am pretty happy. Hopefully it lasts."
happy,"

I guess I'm just trying to put some good vibes for myself out on a night where I feel rather low. I honestly didn't think I could get this far but since February I've lost 32lbs according to my scale this morning. It's probably more once I poop...if I poop."
happy,"Didn't know who to tell this to, so why not literally everyone on the internet?

A year ago I was at my lowest, ready to end it all. No license at 23, stuck in an abusive home, no car, no job, no friends, no plans forward. Almost exactly a year later I have my license, l've bought a car, I'm buying a house with my best friend and now boyfriend (who I've been in love with for months), I have an amazing job lined up, moving out of my state to somewhere heee much better for me and safer. I finally feel like I'm a person!! I’m the happiest I’ve ever been!"
happy,"After long hard months of grinding applications, interviews and dealing with the anxiety that comes along with it I have finally received a job offer from a company that I really like.

I know these moments of happiness are short lived, but this is one of the bigger milestones I’ve achieved in my life and I am extremely proud of myself.

Always remember that if you are willing to work hard enough to achieve something that it is always possible! Don’t give up!"
happy,"In my 30’s, yesterday on my second attempt, I passed my driving test. It still feels like a fever dream and still can’t believe it actually happened but I did it. 

I never thought I would get behind the wheel of a car. Fear and anxiety being a factor but something has always gotten in the way any time I thought about it over the years.

I am so proud of myself for doing something entirely outside of my comfort zone and gaining new independence. 

Happy is an understatement."
happy,"after dealing with anxiety my whole life and suffering a lot of traumatic events, i finally got the help i needed (prozac/fluoxetine) !!

i finally feel happy and less anxious, im arguing with my dad less and things are looking up ! yay !!!! 😁 life is good and it DOES in fact get better"
happy,I still feel happy to be a part of this country 😊 flaws of course but how else would I be able to help if not becoming a citizen. 
happy,"My dad and his girlfriend probaply tought that i needed a younger sibling to get my s*** together lol i visited them every weekend she didn't complain when i said that i wanted to change diapers ""oh yeah? go for it sweetie"" god i can still smell the 💩 lol"
happy,"I love being able to form an environment where people feel safe and comfortable around me. I love listening to people's needs and giving them a safe enough space to express those needs and trust that I won't belittle them for it. 

I just saw a post about this guy who kept getting sick and was worried his girlfriend and sister were poisoning him, and I thought about how me and my girlfriends cook for one another all the time. I get that it's the most basic and normal ass thing to trust someone to cook for you. People in restaurants trust complete strangers to cook for them all the time. But it's kinda sweet when you think about it, that someone you know a lot about and loves you trusts you unsupervised to prepare a substance to put in their body. It's neat. 

Not to mention trusting me not to hurt them too bad when we bring knifeplay into the bedroom (WHICH IS A MUCH BIGGER FORM OF TRUST I KNOW) or trusting me to tie them up or to touch their naked bodies. Ugh, I did that. I fosterd a loving relationship enough times over and over that another person (two people!) will let me have my hands on them in one of their most vulnerable moments. 

And people trusting me to prepare drugs for them. I've had people leave it in my hands, again unsupervised, to measure and dose their first experience with psychedelics. It's an honor, really, to be a good enough person that someone else (who at the time had never met me in real life!) finally met me, and felt comfortable enough to trust me to properly drug them for a good experience. It's sweet. It makes me feel good. I like when people are comfortable around me, and I don't understand how other people enjoy (or at least act like they enjoy) the opposite. "
happy,"Walked around the store today and smiled at a few people sharing glances. It's noticeable their expression changes before you smile at them vs. after. Like, yes old lady checking out the frozen waffles, you deserve smiles and happiness too. 🥰 Makes me extra happy when I do it to other people too, careful guys I'm contagious. You might catch it. 😂"
happy,"recently, life has been busy so i've started to put my phone aside other than for an hour, and honestly it has made all the difference. there are so many unnecessary things we think about when scrolling endlessly on social media , highly recommend putting your phone in another room, so that you feel a weight lifted off your shoulders!"
happy,Not to Jinx myself and I'm knocking on wood. But next week I've been at my job eleven years. It makes me happy because growing up I had learning issues and was in special Ed. And the teachers were not nice. I was told I would never go to college and ide never hold a job. I have so far done both. And I feel..well proud of myself in a way I've beaten odds and expectations. I was told i would be nothing but a failure.
happy,Very damn well pleased with myself.
happy,"This month, I haven’t had a bad day, a suicidal thought or a moment of insecurity. How the fuck is this possible? I can’t believe I’m saying this but I’m genuinely happy. Purely, completely. This is no mood swing or an unusually happy day, because I’ve been consistently happy for weeks. I.. 

1. Kept real friends who actually care 
2. Stopped surrounding myself with sad stuff, like certain .. communities 
3. Go outside more. Work out 
4. This is a bit ironic because I met someone amazing on here but stopped talking to those random redditors lol, they’re usually a mess. No offence 
5. USE LESS SOCIAL MEDIA. Huge part
6. Enjoy my hobbies 

Mama was right, it was that damn phone 

here’s to a smooth ride ahead 🍦😁

happy,"Yesterday, a mysterious someone left this poster and a bucket of flowers. The number of people walking around with flowers was astounding. Plenty of folks in my hometown needed a little happiness. :)"
happy,"I recently met someone. Our first date was during the work week, we met for drinks and ended up talking for 6 hours! Our second date was yesterday. It was so nice. We had ice cream and  went to the museum. He’s smart and funny. Artistic and creative. We had great conversation and he was a complete gentleman. He texted today and asked to go on a proper dinner date. 
I’m looking forward to seeing where this could go. ☺️ "
happy,"My mom, who is literally one of the most thoughtful and kindest people I've ever and probably will ever meet, owns a storage place where she keeps all of her things that she sells. Sometimes, if she knows the person and knows they're struggling, she will give them things for super cheap. Like one time she sold someone she knew was struggling two nice brand new thick comforters for 4 dollars. She's very well known in the area for this and sometimes people will come and knock on her door just to give her stuff that they don't want, just because they know she'll take it and do good with it.

I always had a little pink mini frigidaire that I kept some of my beauty products in and I loved it dearly, but a few months back it stopped working. I never made a big deal out of it but my mom knew of it. Well, she kept it in mind apparently when today she came to me and gave me a practically brand new, perfectly working, mini black frigidaire that one of her friends didn't want anymore. Just because.

My mom is always reminding me that I can have anything that I want in her storage, she even insists on it when I tell her that I want to pay her. She will shout at me and say ""No! Take it! I don't want your money!"" I'm really grateful to her because I'm surrounded by really beautiful things (both vintage and non vintage) because she lets me have anything I want. I'll just look at something for two seconds too long and she'll ask ""You like it? You want it??"" It's funny really.

When she gave me the frigidaire I told her just how grateful I was and that I felt really lucky to have a mom like her. She said to me that I reminded her of herself at my age and that she once said the same words to her mom, who also owned a storage full of stuff that she would sell. Her mom (my grandma) was the same way and gave her whatever she wanted for free. It's no wonder I was surrounded by very pretty, sometimes downright luxurious looking things growing up too!

I know it's a bit superficial, it's not the only reason I am grateful to my mom, but it's just how thoughtful it was. It made me really happy. I'm glad to have a teensy fridge again too."
happy,"I love reddit podcasts, but they can be so saddening, especially the stories about pulling ""pranks"" like lying about tragedies or physical harm. I love to do the complete opposite with my boyfriend, and last night was my favorite. He woke up yesterday and the first thing he said to me was ""I am craving white birthday cake."" so I figured, what's a birthday cake without a birthday party? Here's the prank... his birthday is in July. We gave him the ultimate surprise birthday party when he got off his mother's day restaurant shift."

happy,"I know nothing big but it still makes me happy as I can go to sleep for today now.
Only 1 more thing to programm tomorrow and I will be more or less done!"
happy,"2 years ago, my partner worked at Habitat for Humanity as a family coordinator, where she would help families apply, understand the criteria, and screen families for eligibility. There was a lovely immigrant family of 4, a mom, dad, teenage son, and younger daughter who were incredibly sweet and hardworking. The problem was that they applied 4 times, and each time, they either had just the smallest bit over income or they were not selected. My partner saw how hard working they were and how much this would turn their life around. They lived in a small 1 bedroom apartment and spending way too much on rent.  On the 5th application, my partner made sure that everything was correct, they were eligible, and she went to bat for them during committee selections, ensuring they got a house this time. They talked so often throughout the process and the mom called my partner her “daughter”, that is how close they became. Then one day, my partner gets home and tells me that this family got approved to get a new house after 2 years of rejections. I was floored with emotions as I had become so invested in their wellbeing. 

Now, my partner was the one that would be calling and letting the families know that they would be eligible to receive a home. I was so invested in this family that I made sure to listen to the phone call that she made to the mom of the family on speakerphone. As soon as she called, the mom thought something else was wrong and she didn’t get a home this round. Instead, my partner broke the news that they would be getting a house. That was when I immediately started balling my eyes out. I’m crying, my partner is crying, and the mom was crying.  It’s really hard to describe the amount of love the mom had for my partner and the gratitude she had for my partner doing everything she could to get them a home. I cried for a long time, even after they hung up. I’ve never felt so happy for someone else being so happy. To this day, when I think about that phone call, I tear up and could cry just like that day. I’ve never cried from happiness this way for anyone. As I write this, my eyes fill with tears thinking back to that beautiful moment. 

Later, the mom brought my partner a whole cake and other expressions of gratitude. It’s a moment that will stay with me for the rest of my life. Today, this family is thriving more than they ever have and we keep up with them. "
happy,"Howdy y'all,

A little background: so I'm autistic with a few special interests, e.g. history, aviation, and hot dogs (that one's not important, but still hot dogs are awesome, fight me lol)

Today is not my birthday, but as I'm in the middle of a grueling job search, my friends thought it important to take me out early to both cheer me up and ensure I had a day off.

That is what I assumed, at least!

Turns out these absolute a-holes tricked me and treated me to a lovely day around the city enjoying my favorite things. We went and had a fabulous breakfast before jumping ship to an aviation museum, then enjoying a day by the beach in a more touristy spot of my city before finally going to an art museum styled after a Roman Villa (the Getty Villa in Los Angeles, I highly recommend if you're ever out this way)

Now, I had a blast, but as it turns out, they had one more surprise for me.

A plane ticket to Rome with complete reservations for accommodations!

I'm having a panic attack. I don't know how to respond. I don't know how to pay them back. I'm so incredibly lucky! What could I have possibly done to deserve any of this?!"
happy,One day at a time.
happy,GRAD SCHOOL HERE I COME WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
happy,"Throughout my life I have dealt with a series of health problems and that caused me to be very lethargic. Been to hospital and so on many times. Mainly stuff with my ovaries, kidneys, and liver.  

One thing that made me upset a bit was when I was 17 and attempted to donate blood, but was just not able to due to my condition and problems in general.

Today after dealing with going to the doctors pretty much once a month last year I was finally eligible to donate and so I signed up and did so. 

Happened only a few hours ago and I feel great! Before when I used to get blood drawn for example for medical reasons I would get very nauseous and faint just due to how my health was. Feels strange not feeling that way despite the donation being more blood."
happy,"and also wanted to ask the you, the users of internet if I am the only one who thinks that she looks like soe kind of a fairy."
happy,"I lived with my best friend when I was twenty, and then when I went back to school she got her own place. Then I moved back in with my parents for a while, then I moved into my boyfriend and then husband now ex's house for two years. And now at 29, I'm out of the marriage, and for the first time I'm gonna be living my dream of my very own apartment! I've wanted this for so long it's like a dream come true 🥰🥰🥰 I can't wait to move in on the first!!!!"
happy,"Quit my job

Recently quit my full time job. Was a good position and good pay but my manager went behind my back and basically just gave my position away and expected me to take the demotion purely because she was struggling at the other location and needed me back there to help. It was nothing to do with me or my work as I was really good at my job (don't mean to be bigheaded) but she allowed this other lady to introduce herself to all my colleagues as the manager of my location when they all know that i was there. 
I was really upset because it made it look like it was because I couldn't do my job and she completely broke any trust I had for her. I loved my job and I'm pretty upset BUT I stood up for myself and didn't stand for the lack of respect and told her where to go. I'm proud of myself for doing so and happy I'm no longer working under her. I'm confident I'll get a good job again that gives me the respect and decency I'm owed.

Just needed a lil rant lol don't mind me"
happy,"I'm so so happy I looks at wedding photos and FEEL how much he loves me, how happy I am!"
happy,"A day ago I posted about how happy and excited I was that I made a plan to visit my boyfriend suddenly! And he was surprised a lot! But today he surprised me back by proposing me 😅🥺 So apparently he had plans to propose me before but the ring wasn’t delivered on time , so he was planning to propose me later this month. But since I visited him suddenly, he took this opportunity to surprise me back by taking out the ring at this magical hike we had today. This is probably the best thing ever happened to me, the uno reverse we all need in life ! 😭🤍✌️"
happy,So today I went for a run. Now when I starred I was doing interval training which I still do but today I made through half my route without getting winded or slowing down to walk. I feel amazing. I'm so happy when I make progress. 
happy,Family dog didn't want to come inside from the snow. So I took a break from work and spent some quality time appreciating the outdoors. I'm glad I trusted his instinct.
happy,"I moved into a small flat when I had my first child, we've lived here for a long time and grown our family and made do with what we had. The area we are in isn't the nicest but we always made the best of it. I started looking for something bigger for us 5 years ago. 
2 years ago we were broken into, (nothing taken, it was a drug addict looking for someone, but refused to believe they didn't live in our house), that same year a new neighbor moved in who vandalised cars on the street, picked fights with passers by, started giving sweets to children in their gardens when the parents weren't looking and he eventually broke into a girl nearbys home. (He didn't harm her just scared her and left)
Last week, I got a call that there is a house available via council housing and I can finally have something more affordable, safer and bigger for my children. When I showed my daughter the keys the first thing she asked was 'is it somewhere safe?' And I can finally say yes. I feel more at peace than I have done in years."
happy,"Today I turned 33.  My boyfriend (33M) decided to take me on a small trip to a forest an hour away that he knows is one of my favourite places. 
Things were weird between us the the last couples of weeks but I was happy that we took the trip.
We walked through the woods and I was walking ahead of him and he called out my name. I asked him whatif everything is okay while still looking straight ahead. He asked me to turn around. There he was, holding a ring in his hands, smiling at me and he popped the question. 
I said yes. 
I still can't believe it happened .
I can't believe I'm saying this but I'm engaged and this is most definitely the best birthday I've ever had."
happy,"I spent eight years in an incredibly abusive relationship. Emotionally, mentally, and physically. I was devalued every step of the way and never realized that there were people taking advantage of me. But about two years ago I found people who actually love and care about me, realized my family loves me and that I was being lied to that they didn't. The people who used me did and still will claim I'm a failure, but they wouldn't be where they are without me. But more importantly, I've now surrounded myself with smart, empathetic, kind, successful people and my heart is full of happiness and love now because of it. I have a wonderful relationship, a successful career, and so much to look forward to. I'm so lucky to have what I have now. I'm so happy that I left and can now be a better person for it. I have so much hope for the future that I could never have had before, and I look forward to all of the happiness and success waiting for me now that I've moved on to better things."
happy,"Sorry for the late post, I was busy today so I didn't get my walk in until 7pm. But I made up for it with a picture of something else other than a view! I walked about 2 miles, mostly because I was given permission to walk around the properties on the hill. 

I've also decided to switch to weekly updates, as I don't want to clog r/happy with just my posts. It's just not fair to other posters. 

I love y'all and if you need anything, a pep talk, walking advice, or just wanna talk please feel free to DM me, as I'm alwaysore than happy to talk. Cheers!"

happy,"I was finishing some work, and I realized, while listening to a Gilmore Girls analysis video, that I have genuinely not felt suicidal in a couple of days!

I unfortunately have to go to school tomorrow morning, but for what its worth, I've not been entirely suicidal lately!"

happy,"So basically I (20 M) have lost a shit ton of weight from say weighing 120 kilograms to right now weighing 83 kgs. I regularly go to the gym and I have them muscles too. There's just one teeny tiny issue. I was a hell of a glutton when I was chubby, and that habit still persists in the form of my sweet tooth and binge eating, though not often. 
Today, particularly, I'd eaten more than I'm supposed to, on my calorie deficit, by say 200-300 kcals, and all the PTSD came rushing to my head. I know it's not healthy, but this does not happen often. Okay so, my girlfriend rudely cut my video call cause her friend called and the girls had a nice time putting on face masks and stuff (when my girl (19 F) had told me before that she would do that with me on video call, while we talk.) So obviously this made me feel bad, and along with the PTSD, made my emotions avalanche down the fkin mountain. 
Cue me calling my girl a bit later, she goes ""tell me what's the matter"" in the most bored voice ever. I couldn't stop myself, tears started flowing down my eyes. I didn't know how to tell her what the matter was, and that made my emotions plummet even more.
However, after a while, I gathered composure, told my girlfriend the reasons, that I missed my father, and my grandmothers every single day, think about the days they were alive, and that I get motivation from them, to succeed. I told her about the PTSD regarding my body image issues, and what I consider as freedom from this: I want to be able to rip of my shirt and wear shorts without worrying about my physique whatsoever. (Not to mention I want that athletic physique and am working towards it). 
Where I knew that I'd won, with her as my girlfriend, is when she listened through everything, then at the end, told me stuff I exactly wanted to hear. That how she'd shown a pump picture of mine to one of her guy friends and how the guy praised my physique, how she'd storied a picture of me with a beautiful Persian cat (she was absolutely wonderful, the cat) on instagram, and how her friend replied ""Where were such beautiful and wonderful guys when I was searching for them? What kinda black magic did you perform that suddenly you get such a great guy to be your boyfriend?"". I feel absolutely elated right now.
There was this day I wore a semi-transparent shirt out, and my girl said today: listen babe, yk, I know we went to a temple that day but I could not help thinking unholy shit to do to you.
I am so fucking happy right now. i hope I marry this girl someday."
happy,"Yesterdays workout turned into a slightly longer session than planned. I bought myself a luxurious licorice pipe (not the usual (Swedes knows which one I mean) , but an unknown, more expensive fancy variant!) and planned to treat myself after the session if I did well. The session felt... meh. I go to the reception to return a belly belt I borrowed for maxing out on the leg press, and then I see a guy yelling and causing a scene because his gym card is canceled for some reason. He's loud and creating an aggressive atmosphere. The receptionist is young and thin (less than 50kg), looking very uncomfortable. She has called the police. I try to talk to him.

- If you can't get in, and she only sees that it's blocked, and asks you to contact customer service, then there's nothing more to do. It's not her fault that your gym card is blocked.

But he talks about how badly he's being treated and tries to turn it into a racist thing.

- Call the police, do it! I'm not leaving this place!

And that I'm on the wrong side of what's right and wrong in the world.

- I swear to God! Jalla!

He gets up on a chair and starts waving and screaming even more. I tell him that when he's threatening and aggressive, it's not okay. It's still not her fault. If she asks you to leave, you have to leave. She's the one in charge here.

But he refuses to listen and just keeps rambling about... I don't really know what. That if it were the other way around, he wouldn't be treated this way, and blah blah blah. I wasn't on the HUMAN side, but on the INHUMAN side!

Mkay. Sure, but now she's asking you to leave. She can't do anything about it. He tries to call customer service, but as they don't answer at this time, he gets upset about how unfair it is. Gets up on the chair again, screaming and waving, hitting the lights above him, causing them to flicker. After maybe twenty long minutes of meaningless ranting, three police officers finally come and remove him, and talks to the receptionist.

I go back and stretch a bit. After a while, she comes by, and I see that she is upset and close to tears. First, she apologizes for what happened; it's not something I should have to endure. But she was glad that I was there and handled the situation. I say no worries, it was obvious I had to do something. And SHE shouldn't have to endure this at work. 

I go shower and sauna, and when I'm done and on my way going through the gym to the entrance, I see her again, and ask if she likes licorice. 

-Yes, she answers curiously. I offer her my luxury licorice pipe. She is surprised and wonders if I don't want it for myself. I say it would have been my reward if I had a good session, but it was meh. And, I think she should have something good happening today. She thanked me and said it made her very happy! And that made me happy too, despite the bad session. Win-win! "

happy,I was able to buy the house mostly using money my mother left after she passed away.  And I think she'd be proud and happy knowing the hard work she put in while she was alive helped give me a new chance.  She always wanted me to live happy and now I am.

I tend to have kinda shitty self-esteem so being told to my face something like that with any kind of regularity means a lot. It's nice to be secure in something that matters to me."
happy,One day at a time.
happy,"i had a psychologist to help cope with my overactive mind and imagination, and trauma from my last relationship and i can happily say that i regained control over my life and im so happy "
happy,"I hope he was talking about post-serum! 

But in all seriousness, made my day. When kids are nice, it just seems so genuine. Same kid also asked me if I was a D1 basketball player while I was shooting around (I’m not even close!)

Anyway, it just made me happy."
happy,"I am not a phone addict, but I always used to grab my phone and start doom-scrolling whenever I felt bored, which increased my screen time to somewhere around 5 hours. Deep down, I knew what I was doing was wrong and that I needed to quit, but I wasn't able to do so. Earlier this week, I read an article about phone addiction that mentioned a simple method. I decided to give it a shot in the hopes that it might at least aid me, and I am pleased to report that it worked. I won't claim I fully quit using my phone in a few days, but it did help me minimize my screen usage by about 65%.  "
happy," For some quick context I am an adult male. So to get right into what the title says. My whole life I always felt ""fat"" or ""ugly"". I'm not really sure what had convinced me to think this. I would not starve myself but would purposefully avoid meals or avoid drinking literally anything. This was the case for a good majority of my life so far (I'm 18 now just for reference). This train of thought, obviously damaged my self image, just leading to even more self conflicting issues. around the age of 15 I realized that I wasn't straight, turns out I was bisexual, (""great another reason to hate myself""). I felt even more isolated from others in my life. When I was 17, I accidently came out to my brother and step-mom, I remember going back to my room silently panicking, then venting to my best friend over text. The very next day my dad was joking around and said something like ""you saving yourself for that perfect girl....or BOY!?"" and I very stupidly said yes to both, realizing what I said made me internally panic again. To my surprise, my dad (who is Christian) was very very okay with it. For the days I almost began to cry on my way to school, due to the amount of weight lifted off of me. through the last remaining months of the year I felt like I was finally being accepted. To speed up this annoyingly long story, during the months leading up to and past my 18th birthday I was hit like a truck with a wave of sadness, tried something that I'm really happy it didn't workout, opened up to my step-mom and dad about it , got therapy, and processed my feelings healthily. This lasted for a 3-4 month period. Now in the year 2024 I still have my issues that I solve, but I have this underlying feeling of pure happiness that just sits dormant inside of me. I'm not sure if its an underlying issue problem of mine. Almost every time I go to take a shower I spot myself in the mirror (I'm usually fully clothed or just shirtless). I would stop and jokingly flex and check out myself (too clarify the mirror was only tall enough to show from above my head down and about to slightly above the waist), then proceed with my shower. Even today, I felt a surge of 5 am confidence and decided to open obs and take off my shirt and started to pose and check out myself out a bit and I thought in an exaggerated way ""omg I'm kinda... hot!"". Just being able to type this story out makes me feel so much appreciation for just life and how far I have progressed in my life. I know this sounds very cheesy, but I feel that if I were to meet younger self, my younger self would be very proud of us. I still feel random surges of sadness every now and then, but I usually break free from those episodes within the week. I can now confidently and proudly say that I'm happier now than I ever been in my ongoing life, and I know now that I'm not alone and I wont ever be. So as I go to end this embarrassingly long post, I want you, the reader to know you're loved and cared about. Sorry if this is hard to understand or if the grammar is a horror show to yall, I've been contemplating typing and posting this for a stupid amount of time and plus its almost 7 am. "
happy,"Backstory: my grandfather played for Ike & Tina Turner in the 60’s. He “retired” from playing about 12 years ago, but tonight I convinced him to play one last time to end 2023. 
The sax he’s playing is a Buescher Aristocrat built in 1949 that was purchased for him by his father. He gifted me the saxophone for my 26th birthday & I start lessons next week. 
I’m infinitely proud of him & have some big shoes to fill. Happy New Year! 🎉"
happy,"I was a mess for two decades, booze, coke, just whatever. I have now made it two years without a drink or any coke. I'm so happy right now. I was able to go back to school and I went from a 36 waist to a 30. I later gave up sodas and energy drinks, but alcohol was the tough one. Two years!!!"
happy,This works good if I'm sad about stuff that isn't a huge deal which is a lot of the time haha
happy,"It’s actually not fair how hot, smart and good at League of legends I am. Even this ugly yeeyeeass sir Isaac newton haircut isn’t enough to nerf me. I need to give my parents a trophy for best chefs of 2002 CAUSE THEY WERE COOKING 
"
happy,"And I rigged it up to open with a fake book. This is something I've always, always wanted, and it makes me ridiculously happy to have finished the project. Downstairs is my game room, with old consoles, my gaming PC, and tons of nerd stuff like Lego sets and Star Wars and Star Trek paraphernalia."
happy,"I’ve been dealing with a manager who likes to pick on me and make me feel inadequate …. And this only my first few weeks at this job. 🤬
I went from 3 meals to just about having breakfast, to not showering, to being numb and then switching to shaking and anxious. 😥😖😣
My husband was there for me so much but  bless him he had his own work issues so I turned to Reddit. 💬
I didn’t expect this but a couple redditors really pulled me out from this rut; they gave me bursts of confidence through their advice and eventually I mustered the courage to hand in my resignation. 💪🏼
I haven’t had the exit talk yet so yeah I am a bit nervous but I managed to get up and shower today, changed into clothes that made me feel nice oh and actually ate a full breakfast. 👖🍳🫂

So thanks guys and thanks to everyone else who are nice and helpful on these communities; I have seen similar posts to mine regarding anxiety and job stress but people have shown sense of community, courage and morale to help those in need. 
🏡🤗

Thank you 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰

happy,I almost overslept on my last test but I made it and now I’m done with my third semester and how close I am to Graduation.. it’s crazy how fast.. life goes by when you do something you love!
happy,"Since the beginning of the month. I've started strength training and running. Now at the end of the month I can do 40 sit ups, 40 push ups, can jog a quarter mile, I can now lift heavier weight. And I've dropped 5 pounds. "
happy,"* I've been consistently going to the gym for a year and three months, and I'm muscular now.
* Also, I've been going for my master's degree in IT with a specialization in Software Engineering, and I have a 4.0 GPA so far.
* Plus, I've got a good clean conscience.
* Furthermore, I've been helping others in need.

I finally feel strong physically, emotionally, and intellectually now. I am confident in myself now. I have changed from weak to strong."
happy,"hi- new-ish to reddit but just wanted to say that i’m happy with where i am in life right now. from last august-the end of the year i had no job and bills were draining my savings. 
after spending so much during the holidays, i NEEDED to get a job after the new year. it became my unspoken resolution. so after my guests left, i started applying. 
now, here I am, a SOLID paycheck in. PLUS i’m supporting a super cool small business!
i can’t wait to start saving up again. last year was rough. 
cheers! stay happy!"
happy,"Two years ago I was in the darkest place I’ve ever reached and I’m sure it wasn’t that bad but for my young brain at the time, I thought I’d never get to be happy.I posted in TW depression pages/ suicide daily.  Being happy was a foreign concept to me my whole teenage hood and child hood I often had depression Until I worked on it hard very hard. 

Fast forward to today, I am currently laying in bed so content next to my husband and my cats are cuddled up between us purring and I often find myself crying since getting pregnant that I’m happy and grateful I am to be here, but !! I was smiling  and happy crying at life before I got flooded with pregnancy hormones. 

Long story short I think I’m finally happy I am confidently able to say it. 

"
happy,"Around November of last year I (26F) matched with this guy(26M), he's honestly one of the sweetest guys I've met on a dating app. We were talking for a whole, but had to go out seprate ways, because he was unemployed then and looking for a job and had other things going on in his life. He felt like he couldn't give me time. Which was totally ok and understable. 

Anyway in one of our conversation where he was stressed about not getting a job, I remember giving him a pep talk, and he told me then that when he gets a job I'll be one of the first few people he'll tell. 

It's been around two months since we stopped talking and he texted me today that he got a hired! I'm also suprised that he remembered and texted me about his job. I'm so happy for him. In suprising turn off events in currently unemployed after leaving a toxic workspace and seeing him get a job, made me feel not so bad about my own unemployment. So to whoever is in the same boat. We got this! We'll get a good job that will make us happy."
happy,Recently I've been looking for a new drill and I went to a hardware store and saw all of the drills where 100-200 bucks! So I decided to travel to (generic value store) and got a hammer drill for 25 dollars! it works amazing and has 2 modes and I'm really happy about it! ( I left the store name out of this because I don't want this to sound like a promoting a company )
happy,"I lived with my best friend when I was twenty, and then when I went back to school she got her own place. Then I moved back in with my parents for a while, then I moved into my boyfriend and then husband now ex's house for two years. And now at 29, I'm out of the marriage, and for the first time I'm gonna be living my dream of my very own apartment! I've wanted this for so long it's like a dream come true 🥰🥰🥰 I can't wait to move in on the first!!!!"
happy,"I spent all of February in rehab for alcohol. I spent 6 months in a homeless shelter, got my CDL, picked out a company of my choosing, bout to be an uncle 3 times over, and recently celebrated 7 months sober! This is the first time in 6 years I’ve been truly happy. If you’re having a hard time feel free to contact me, I’d love to chat!"
happy,"A few days ago my co worker complimented me on my hair. She said that it's in perfect condition and that she loves it.
Yesterday I met up with my dearest friends, and my friend's girlfriend told me how she was chatting with her friend some time ago, and they both agreed on how I looked like I came straight out of a movie last time we met.
Ngl, lately I didn't feel good about my appearance, so this really lifted my spirit. I thought I was going to melt both of these times lol.
"
happy,"I didn’t even interview, she said she knew she wanted to hire me for the position which shocked me as it was not the position I originally applied for. I know I won’t get paid right away but it’s something my landlord (hopefully) will work with. I haven’t had any money coming into this home for the last 3 months and to start working in a field I have been wanting to be in, brings tears to my eyes. 

I hope this is long enough and fleshed out more so it won’t get flagged. I NEVER post things that are private but with this win I feel like maybe I should start sharing with the world a bit more. Thank you for taking the time to read this message. "
happy,"I’m traveling in Korea at the moment.  Japan last week.  Life is good despite all the info to the contrary.  Find time to enjoy and reflect on how far you’ve come.  We are living in the best of times, believe it or not.  Hugs to all. "
happy,"Today's been a really lovely. I felt so at peace handwashing antique quilts in textile cleaner to remove the yellow age stains so they become like new again, just a couple spots need to be patched up and already have some choice fabrics in mind (got some really nice cotton calico prints at a free sale a couple years ago and a few nice quilt squares at a church sale). Save that project for a rainy day. Went out to some yard sales today and got some nice antique furniture for really cheap and some work clothes. I love looking at how they joined wood furniture back then, no nails or screws, just complex wood joinery and yet it's so unbelievably sturdy. The solid cedar wardrobe needs to be stripped, sanded and stained with a wood oil but it's lovely and has a cute little mirror and hanger and everything. I really loved how helpful the gentleman selling it was too. He helped carry the furniture into my vehicle and he just seemed really kind and gentle. His mum raised him right. Something about this being his mum's furniture is bittersweet. That's the wonderful thing about these older pieces, they're loved and I hope whoever takes on these pieces after me, loves them equally as much. I do wonder sometimes who the craftsman is behind all of this. It's kind of paying tribute to his art and how it carries on after death. 😊🥰"
happy,"Told myself on Halloween night of 2022 it was time for a change. 12/1/2022 318 lbs, 5/28/2023 285 lbs, 5/28/2024 163 lbs."
happy,"This morning I was going to work and it was dark but I saw my bf pass me on the highway on our way to work, I instantly got butterflies. Then when I got to the Dunkin drive thru who do I see in front of me….. it’s him. Lol I didn’t think he would notice but then when I got to the window to pay for my coffee the cashier said “here you go. The gentleman in front of you already paid” it’s the little things. y’all I’m so in love 🥰 "
happy,it’s all..we are happy and it’s beautiful 
happy," I am so happy. Today I was able to get my own room after having been homeless for a few months. Lost my job and previous home and this last two years have been rough, but definitely back on track now. What a blessing!

 Edit: Can't really believe this got so much attention. Your messages feel amazing to me and I would love to post more of it as I save up and can start upgrading some things and making the room more 'mine'.

Much love to everyone!"
happy,"I'm big into the local music scene as a local musician, amateur gig photographer, and just general lover of grassroots music. For my birthday, my boyfriend secretly set-up a non-profit music promoter enterprise, booked four of my favourite local bands to play at a local grassroots venues on my birthday weekend, and arranged for all ticket sales to go to one of my favourite local charities! 

It's without a doubt the most thoughtful thing anyone has ever done for me, and I'm totally blown away by it! 

"
happy,Had to get lab work today and found this on the way out! I DO feel lucky! 
happy,"I almost always owe something so I typically wait until the last few days to file. I was pleasantly surprised a moment ago. Not only did I not owe for 2023 BUT I got a small refund 🙏🏼 I’m happy dancing right now ☺️ 
"
happy,"I was being intimate with a white guy and I’m an awkward person so I said I had “hair extensions” and he didn’t mind. He didn’t care at all. He treated me like a normal person… he even touched my head gently a couple of times which made my hairstyle a bit messy but nothing bad happened.

I’m young and the reason I wear wigs is I don’t want to hear damage my real hair :3"
happy,"i've so many years hating my voice, i never like recording my voice or send voice messages, until a few days ago i recorded a video, when i was playing it that i noticesd that my voice changed since last time i recording my voice (maybe 4 yrs ago), my voice used to soud like the cracky puberty nerd voice... now i feel good about my voice and love how thad sounds. could sound sptupid but i feel good about that change, sounds more like an adult (i'm about 30yrs old), idk if my voice change or my perception changed but i feel more comfortable."
happy,"Told myself on Halloween night of 2022 it was time for a change. 12/1/2022 318 lbs, 5/28/2023 285 lbs, 5/28/2024 163 lbs."
happy,Got boba and a sandwich from my favorite Vietnamese fusion place to celebrate!
happy,"I work by myself in animal rescue in a place where abandoned animals is pretty common. After my money goes into them and my own groceries, I often have next to nothing to spend on myself. For the last year and a half, I was sleeping on an old donated sofa bed in the main room. But my birthday was last month, and some friends chipped in to buy me the mattress, bed frame, and even new pillows and bedsheets! I did end up building it myself, which took the whole month because I had to find time between running around doing animal stuff, so it feels like my accomplishment too. I just feel so proud of myself and so happy and lucky to have great friends.
"
happy,We finally found some second hand ones given away for free! And they're so nice looking too!
happy,"Are they enough?

I moved away from family and friends to another state over 1000 miles away. It’s just my husband, two dogs and me. I work from home. I’m 52 years old and it’s hard to make friends at this age. Is it wrong that I feel content and dare I say happy with the limited companionship? Social media tells me I should have friends to hang out with on a weekly basis. 

I like hanging out at home with my pups and husband. I read and garden. We have fires and cocktails. 

Am I missing out? Should I be trying harder? I do go back “home” twice a year to see family and one or two friends."
happy,"This admittedly isn't a giant achievement, but it made me happy. Ever since I was a little kid, I've wanted to have Minecraft on the computer, I idolized a lot of MC youtubers back then ( such as Amylee33, StacyPlays, GamingwithJen, dantdm and stampylongnose) and wanted to do what they did. And now I finally have it on my own pc! I luckily managed to save enough for my mom to let me get a card to buy it with. I plan to make a bunch of builds soon!"
happy,"I'll get my certification in the mail soon. I was so nervous as the desktop was loading to give me my grade. I'm just happy to be done and over with it all. Thank god. 🙏🏼 I can't wait to get it in the mail. 

Please pray for me (if you pray) because I have a 100question exam that I'll be taking on my own time this weekend for Lean Six Sigma / project management. 🤞🏼 It's a 2hr test, 100 questions. "
happy,I felt so happy to see nature and these ducks. 
happy,Just wanted to share. 
happy,My husband is on the path to the airlines which means we get to spend lots of Sunday afternoons flying around to get hours. Sedona is always spectacular 
happy,Change is a bitch. 
happy,"my boyfriend and i are both 16. were immature, sometimes a little petty, but undoubtedly in love. my mother died before i met him, but since he’s known me he’s supported me through the grief of losing her and even has visited her grave by himself on his own time. he helps me talk about her, and says that he wishes he could have known her. it means more than he knows.

i come from a drug addict mother and angry father, so my model for a relationship wasn’t the best. i’ve messed up with him, i’ve said things i didn’t mean when i was upset, but he’s been nothing but patient with me. he’s taught me how to talk things out and admit when i’m upset about something, and to not harbor my emotions.

he’s making me a better person, and i love him unconditionally. he’s the first person i’ve been comfortable enough to let him see every single side of me, mentally and behaviorally. anyways, just wanted to say there are still good people out there, and everyone deserves someone who treats them the way my boyfriend treats me!! "
happy,"
I have been bullied for a lot of my childhood for various reasons and one of them was me being a little chubby (I was not even overweight) so it naturally destroyed my self confidence and caused me to develop anxiety and even depression at one point. I also struggle with binge eating while stressed. 

Now growing up my parents might have made a few mistakes here there that I could not handle but lately they seem to talk to me in a more positive and mature manner and it warms my heart. I know for a fact that they had to unlearn certain behaviours and ideas to have this outlook.


For example the other day I noticed that my favourite pair of jeans started ripping apart near the thigh area and I was beating myself up for it getting torn because I have put on weight since I bought them two years back. My parents casually reassured me that it was just a piece of clothing and I can always get a new pair that fits me perfectly. They also said clothes are meant to fit you and not the other way around . It might not sound much to them but for me it was a huge deal. 

Also I love dressing masculine and wearing clothes from men’s section all the time, even though I personally think clothes are genderless but corporate world doesn’t really think the same right, so we happen to have a lot of stores that exclusively sell menswear. When I first started to ask my mom to take me the store she immediately took me there no questions asked, she never says anything to me when getting clothes from the men’s section. I know this is how it should be but I know a lot of friends who aren’t allowed to do the same.  I mentioned this to her and she casually went clothes are for comfort and people can wear whatever they want as long as they feel good wearing them 😭❤️

These things may not look like a big deal to everyone but I know little me would be jumping with joy right now."
happy,"I love reddit podcasts, but they can be so saddening, especially the stories about pulling ""pranks"" like lying about tragedies or physical harm. I love to do the complete opposite with my boyfriend, and last night was my favorite. He woke up yesterday and the first thing he said to me was ""I am craving white birthday cake."" so I figured, what's a birthday cake without a birthday party? Here's the prank... his birthday is in July. We gave him the ultimate surprise birthday party when he got off his mother's day restaurant shift."
happy,"Today my mom called me and asked if I wanted some framed photographs my grandfather made. Immediately I said yes. My grandpa is going on 84 however growing up him and my grandma had a huge hand in raising me, my brother and two of my younger cousins one of which I actually got an invite to his wedding in the summer. I looked at the photography and it's absolutely beautiful and he took in one of my favorite vacation spots. tawas Michigan. So double meaningful. I'm very happy to have this in my home. Honored really. And when he does eventually go I'll have something very nice to remember him with."
happy,Back from a deployment and finally got to take my mom out for a birthday celebration. Long overdue.
happy,"Today marks 1 year of not experiencing a panic attack. 🥹 Mine were severe - included vomiting, heart irregularities, tremors, sweating, a fleeting feeling, and occasionally paralysis. I felt as though I would never be free of these, until I moved and surrounded myself with lovely, caring individuals. I have not had one since and I want to jump around in happiness. My mental health was declining a few years back and now I feel like it might be at its positive peak which I’m eternally grateful for. This past week especially I’ve felt an overwhelming sense of peace. Just wanted to post in case anyone else is suffering, I still get anxiety but from all the work ive done and being in the right place has helped so much and the anxiety is very minor. 🙌🏼💕"
happy,"I haven't seen him in 3 years.. but a today was my lucky day! I needed to go at court for personal reasons and was already crying about him,I thought he forgot about me! ( I even thought he died even he texted my auntie!) But as soon I saw him I started to ball my eyes out! It been years since I cried happy tears,but we was able to talk and catch up but then he told me his life was terrible and that this was the best day in years! I'm still crying... because this was my best day in years to! Before me and him needed to go are own ways again,he gave me a card for my birthday with 60 dollars! But at this point I don't care about the cash I just care about the moment.. but that's all now! Have the best day folks!"
happy,"He moved around to get comfy and he laid his head on my hand like a pillow and he always comes to comfort me whenever I don’t feel well, I love him"
happy,"For me, the first thing I used to do was check my emails but it was super stressful, and also my whole day would be bad if the email was crucial and msg was bad but when I stumbled across this quote from Sadhguru life isn't the same. 'When you wake up in the morning, the first thing you should do is Smile. You are Alive! Is that not the greatest blessing and reason enough to Smile?'  
  
So every day when I wake up I smile not towards anybody, I just smile. This very small act has changed my attitude to look toward life :)  
  
What's your tip?"
happy,"I know I know; every community has it's toxic weeds that grow.

But so far my experience on Reddit has been like a walk in the park, and I'm just happy to read so many well written, sad, happy, funny, thought provoking, and interesting  posts/stories!

I always heard Reddit getting made fun of for the most part (and for good reason at times well deserved ofc) and even heavily bashed or told it was a ""cesspool of nasty to absolutely stay away from"".

 I stayed away for a long time, like the plague indeed, but I thought, ""Why not personally give it a shot,"" and see what happens, eh?

Never been a big social media person anyway since I'm not the best at being social, writing, taking pics, or navigating around strangers, so I'm beyond impressed so far with the community and am just happy my experience thus far has been good. :) 

And I'm just giddy to see what great, terrible, hilarious, irksome, and strange posts are yet to come.
Not to be sappy, I'm just happy to enjoy something new and am trying to find happy things to experience, especially with how lucky I am to be alive now.

Simple pleasures are my go to and I'm just getting older and more years are silently passing by. 
And I'm learning how to be a better writer thanks to y'all! I haven't written since high school, and am falling in love all over again with this hobby. 

I haven't seen such good writing, interesting stories, or funny jokes in ages. Impressed and can't wait to be more impressed and, somehow, even let down someday 😅if that even is something to look forward to."
happy,Been slightly over 2 and a half years sober but my third birthday sober...working towards my third year this August and this pupper means the world to me. Hes my little buddy and I owe him so much.
happy,"Just remember guys there are good things and people in the world, you just gotta find them :) thank you couple wherever you are now!"
happy,"Even tho it’s quite embarrassing I wanted to share this. This is Caesar my poodle puppy who is ready to greet me early every morning. This means I have to get up and out to walk him first thing, something that I COULD NOT and WOULD NOT ever do before I had him because of my agoraphobia. He has given me more independence and has made me progress so much faster. He even helps with my panic attacks. But most importantly I love him and he makes me happy!"
happy,"We've only been dating for a few weeks now, but she is incredibly thoughtful--she made soup and dropped it off for me when I got covid over the holidays, we've made each other playlists and I am enthralled by the one she made me, she sends me really sweet voice messages when she wakes up and before she goes to bed, she says incredibly sweet, silly, and romantic things that make me blush for days at a time. I have never felt so safe and held and seen and attracted to someone all at once so quickly before. She is really forthright and curious and has a lot of integrity. I admire her a great deal and feel so lucky to be able to see who she is becoming (she is trans and has been honoring herself in some pretty big ways lately and witnessing that from the sidelines has been really beautiful and touching). I am not sure how long we'll be together but for now I am very grateful she is in my life. "
happy,"I know it might be nothing special for you but for me - a person who feels like doesn't make significant progress in English it's quite special. It's more important for me as I didn't attend any special classes to prepare myself for this exam and tbh I didn't prepare at all so it makes me proud of myself that I could pass it relying just on my overall English skills. As a student of applied linguistics that includes studying English in my course, I often feel that I am not even close to the English level of the most of my fellow students and that's true for sure but this exam has shown me that I'm not that bad at English."
happy,"A few years ago when I was in Year 13 (last year of high school in the UK) my form tutor didn't show up one day and it turned out she was having a family bereavement. She was very well liked and her family was all the way in New Zealand so it felt like we could hardly just do nothing.

I stepped up to the plate and bought a card, and somehow got it around the whole form class, plus a few people in the media class she took in our year as I recall, over the course of a few days without her knowing. The message I wrote in the card was ""don't be sad it's over, be glad it happened"", which was what I lived by when my Grandma died a couple of years later in 2022. 

The day comes to give it to her, and it turns out a few girls in the class have also bought her a box of chocolates, even better right? They hand her the chocolates, and I make my friend hand her the card because of my social anxiety. We thought she'd appreciate it, but we got more than we bargained for. She's clearly holding back tears and starts talking about how loved she felt and how lucky she was to be our form tutor.

This was during the few months of COVID where schools were open in the UK, so things were obviously really grim at the time. She was a really sweet, positive, glass half full person to be around and so form class with her was really the only thing keeping a lot of us going. Not only did the gifts have a good impact on her, but it felt like we'd paid her back a little as well."
happy,"I didn’t want cats. But these two little guys are here now and I’m so glad they are. 

My older one was a bony 6-month-old stray last winter that begged my mom for help, he demanded attention. He wanted love so much that the thought of sending him to a shelter where he’d be alone in a cage broke my heart, so I took him in. My younger one was a 1-2-month-old kitten who went on an adventure. She climbed into my roommate’s fiancée’s car while she was delivering food in a trailer park and wouldn’t leave. She took the kitten home, but her dog didn’t get along with it. Based on how she described the kitten, I again couldn’t send it to the shelter, so I took her in. 

Both live with me in my college apartment. It took some adjusting for them, but it was worth it. They’re best friends now, I love seeing them together. They play fight constantly, I can tell my older one is holding back and my younger one is learning how to catch him off guard. They love to eat at the same time as well. The older one always sleeps right by me and the younger tends to sleep on the ground or in the cat tree. When I wake up in the morning, they’ll both wake up too, and and younger one will always hop up on my bed purring and immediately go touch noses with my older one. 

We had to travel back home for Christmas, my older one has bad separation anxiety and he would’ve been alone for a couple days so I took both of them. They were stressed in their new environment. So when we went to bed, they cuddled with each other, paws on one another for comfort and support. 

I’m so glad I’ve been able to provide them a good home. Watching them grow up has been an honor. From putting their first collars on them to seeing my kitten see snow for the first time, there’s so much to smile about. They’ve got so much time to spend with each other, I’m looking forward to it. I’m glad I’ve not only been able to give them a home, but that I’ve given them siblings and best friends, another cat that they can trust and play with."
happy,I went to the dentist and I’m scared of them but they let me listen to music so I listened to stuff from Bob’s Burgers (my special interest) and I wore my pink slippers and Bob’s Burgers shirt! I found my Phoebe Bridgers shirt again and I got candy since I couldn’t eat it before! My cavities on my front teeth are filled well the one is but I’m so happy I never thought I’d do it !!! I can’t stop smiling when I see a mirror just to look at my teeth!
happy,"I gave birth ten months ago and it's been a struggle to have the discipline to get into a bedtime routine but now that I have, I have time to do some yoga before going to sleep. It feels like a huge accomplishment and I feel so much happier now that I'm getting back into physical exercise"
happy,"I love him so very, very much."
happy,"Growing up I was very thin, but in 2020 I got diagnosed with PCOS I went from 64kgs to 87 kgs over night making all my clothes tight and impossible to wear. I developed and still have body dysmorphia. 
I would always have to buy multiple shein clothes to find something that would fit me. 
Yes plus size exists but I’m one size too small for plus size and one size too big for XL.

Yesterday I went to a shop and found 3 dresses in the style I love 
Which fit me perfectly and had every colour and pattern I wanted I bought 3. But I might god back and get some more. 

I might not be so exciting for others but for me, it made me feel so beautiful and accepted and just happy. "
happy,Change is a bitch. 
happy,"Hi everyone!

So my girlfriend and I (both women <3 if that's an issue for you, please just don't interact with this post) started dating at the end of January this year. This was after my ex-boyfriend and I broke up a few weeks before (we were together 4 years but it had been over a year that it wasn't working out. I don't want comments on this, you'll understand why later).

I have a lot of anxiety around relationships. My ex verbally abused me for the first part of our relationship, and then he was never physically there because he had to stay back home for understandable reasons. I was unhappy. I did things that hurt him too, and I've looked into why I did what I did and am learning to overcome what happened between us (the things he used to say to me in anger outbursts).

Now I've been friends with my girlfriend for 3 ish years now. I always thought she was so gorgeous and funny. I got to spending more time with her and next thing I knew, I was falling in love. I don't know what I did to get so lucky. Whenever I come forward about my feelings about something, she NEVER gets mad at me. She's so calm, so chill. She reassures me gently, and listens to me while explaining to me why this is okay, that I am valid. When I'm down for whatever reason, she makes me laugh without a problem. I can do anything with her and we can make it fun! I laugh harder with her than anyone else. She engages in things that I like and genuinely enjoys them, and vice versa.

The other day, we were snuggling and chatting in bed. I don't remember what she said, but it really hit home and I just felt my eyes start to water. She asked me what was wrong, and I just looked at her and said ""I just realized how unsafe I felt in the world before you"". She smiled and pulled me in, she let me cry on her for a few seconds.

She lets me talk about my ex and what happened. She knows I'm far from romantically or sexually interested in him anymore. She's so kind about the fact that I do miss him sometimes as a friend (I mean, 4 years with someone and talking almost every day is hard to let go of). I don't think about it often, really. She lets me talk about the things he did/said to me that hurt me deeply. I mean even yesterday we were talking about some of the horrible things he said and she looked at me and said ""I want to show you what a soft love looks like."" I just stared at her in awe and shock. I was frozen in place, just...speechless. She makes it safe for me to express excitement about things I love, she doesn't judge me for the things I enjoy, and SHE DOESN'T GET MAD AT ME!!! She doesn't insult me beyond what we both agree are jokes, she gently redirects me towards healthier behaviors for my mental health and for the relationship, we're both working together to be healthy and I just...wow....She's even coming home with me for Easter weekend (we don't celebrate but hey, why not).

I'm beyond happy with her. Maybe it's too soon to tell, I don't know, but I want to marry her someday. I really think this is it, that she's my future wife. She's currently asleep in my bed. I want her to be my love for the rest of our lives. She is truly and unequivocally the most beautiful person I've ever met (inside and out). I can't see a day where I don't find her funny anymore, where I don't find her attractive anymore, where I don't want to run to her to tell her about my day. I want to share my world with her. She's my best friend and more. I've never been happier, and I've never felt more like me.

If you read this whole thing, thank you so much :) I know it's a lot, it's messy, and honestly I can't even say everything I feel about this woman because I just don't have the words to express the deep, honest love I have for her. I wish you all the most WONDERFUL day!"
happy,"Hit my lowest point ever a few months ago. Went out to the train tracks to end it all, not gonna lie. The cause was the ending of a five year relationship, naively thinking that they were the 'one' and all that junk. 

What saved me, and is keeping me going, is... the various friends I made along my healing journey (seriously, both new and old friends really stepped up to help), discovering awesome new hobbies (photography, boxing, fishing, etc), rediscovering the joy in old hobbies (cycling, foraging, language learning, etc), learning to love myself, helping others (got stuck focusing all my love on one person), becoming more involved in my community, and just letting go of my frustrations and anxieties and just living in the moment! 

And... the cherry on top is that I ended up meeting this pretty awesome friend who I'm, honestly, relating to and vibing with. Life is like ""hey, you're doing great with self love and healing, here's your reward: a friend who is almost identical to you, enjoy!"" Hahahaha so awesome! 

Looking forward to being done with university next year and being able to live a happy and fulfilling life :) and so many other dreams and goals to look forward to!"
happy,"I spent all of February in rehab for alcohol. I spent 6 months in a homeless shelter, got my CDL, picked out a company of my choosing, bout to be an uncle 3 times over, and recently celebrated 7 months sober! This is the first time in 6 years I’ve been truly happy. If you’re having a hard time feel free to contact me, I’d love to chat!"
happy,"Today I've been feeling stressed due to personal family issues, and I've been mentally ruminating on these issues for 1-2 hours. When I got to the gym (thankfully by myself) I was still ruminating. That changed when I got to my last exercise, sumo deadlifts (I like to save the best exercises for last). I hit a 5 RM sumo deadlift today, and my mood was uplifted. 

Now I'm happy AND proud I hit a milestone!! :)"
happy,"I know this sounds silly. 

But my friend is going through a bad divorce. He's been abused for 30 years by a wack job. He got kicked out of his place, and I offered my couch. 

We're sitting on my bed, watching a movie, and high. He has had a terrible day, so I'm trying to make it better. I noticed he took a picture of a gift I got him and posted it to a Reddit sub. 

I asked what he was doing, and he got so excited. He told me he was in this nice sub and everyone is so welcoming, that his post got 700 karma. He is very, very new to this app and is older, so he's not up to snuff with everything. 

But he just lit up when he showed me how excited he was that people were talking to him and that they liked his post so much that he got ""a little karma"" 

This man has cried his eyes out for hours tonight; seeing him beam about something so small just filled my heart. I'm overjoyed to see him this excited! 

Anyway, I just, really want this man to be happy, so for this small thing to really bring him joy just makes my chest burn.

Edit: 

If you all want to give him some love I'll link his art post. It'll make him very excited that people enjoy his art. He only ever shares it within his work space. Not sure why but I think it'll get him excited.

happy,"The first woman I ever fell in love with was simply a victim of circumstances at the time.  Despite my maturity and the intensity of our bond, we were four years apart during a time that just wouldn't have been fair for us to continue.

A failed marriage and one child each later, she called me out of the blue.  I'm barely 6 months removed from the end of an 8 year marriage.  I thought about calling this woman weeks after it ended, but it wouldn't have been fair.  She and I deserve the time and space to explore our relationship without the cloud of my divorce hanging over it.

Last monday when I was out of town, she called me on a whim.  The universe told her to so loudly that she stopped what she was doing to reach out.  She had no idea of my circumstance (unless she's lying, which is way out of her character).  When her name popped up on my phone, my belly fell straight through my ass and every hair and goosebump on my body sprang to attention.

We've texted and talked every day since.  Like teenagers.  It's amazing.  Each of our kids got sick the day I got back from my business trip.  Twice our plans to reconnect physically have been delayed by the universe.  I am still on cloud 9.  I don't know where it's heading, aside from unbelievable sex. I do know that the connection that her and I have maintained through the years, despite the distance and separation, is unlike anything I've shared with anyone before.  

I'm terrified of how quickly our energy reconnected. Having had a week and two cancelled meetings to build the tension and bond through words and phone calls has been insanely hot.  I haven't been this happy, though, since a year before my marriage ended, at least.  

In the end I just needed to put this into the world.  Of the thousands of emotions I'm dealing with through this, happiness and hope are the two strongest.  I hope that whatever the next days and weeks bring, that I can maintain the feeling of positivity that she's brought into my heart."
happy,"and also wanted to ask the you, the users of internet if I am the only one who thinks that she looks like soe kind of a fairy."
happy,"Over 2 years ago, a friend of ours passed away leaving 3 kids orphaned and a half sibling without a support system. My wife and I took in all 4 kids, as we were quite close with the kids. We got legal guardianship of the 2 youngest about 6 months after they moved in. The youngest is now 10. She started calling my wife ""Mommy"" about a year ago. This took some getting used to as all of our other kids call her ""Mom"". 

I however, remained Mr. MyFirstName. She has never had a dad before, and she had always called me that before she moved in. She gives me hugs everyday (now) and tells me she loves me frequently (yes, I know this won't last). So I was not worried about what she calls me. We went on a trip with my brother and his family, and sometime during the week, she just started calling me ""Daddy"". I'm not sure if it was because her cousin (my niece - 6F) calls my brother Daddy (a lot) or what caused it. At one point, we were at a theme park, and she was calling me Daddy over and over again, and I completely missed it, because I wasn't used to it and her voice is similar to my niece. My SIL grabs my arm and says ""Daddy!!!  Someone is calling you"". I felt awful, and so overjoyed at the same time. We've been home several days and I'm still Daddy (and getting used to it), but also Mr. MyFirstName sometimes too, but it still makes me smile.

  
We are hoping the adoption will be finalized this year. "
happy,"Sorry for the late post, I was busy today so I didn't get my walk in until 7pm. But I made up for it with a picture of something else other than a view! I walked about 2 miles, mostly because I was given permission to walk around the properties on the hill. 

I've also decided to switch to weekly updates, as I don't want to clog r/happy with just my posts. It's just not fair to other posters. 

I love y'all and if you need anything, a pep talk, walking advice, or just wanna talk please feel free to DM me, as I'm alwaysore than happy to talk. Cheers!"
happy,"my online friend from a different country visited for her birthday and invited me to disneyland! i have never gone before in my life! i was really taken aback by her offer too. she bought my ticket, for her bday celebration trip? 😭😭😭

she made it possible that me and my partner could actually afford to go and meet her there. 🥺🥺🥺

i brought her a gift related to her one of her special interest, it was something she said she wanted too, so it was perfect and she was so happy. she also gifted me a plush, which is my special interest! i will cherish this plush forever. 

my partner and i spent the whole day with her and it was amazing. i have no irl friends, only online as it is what i prefer. i find like-minded individuals with the same interests! we are also both diagnosed with ASD, and we really clicked as friends in real life as we do online! ☺️ it was just the same! 

she is going back to her home country tomorrow and that’s bittersweet, but the memories we made today were priceless!

this is the first online friend i’ve ever met in person before too. she is such a sweet friend! my partner really enjoyed hanging out with her too! 

had to gush about my day, as it’s the best i’ve had in a very long time. maybe ever."
happy,"I’m nervous but also really proud of myself because I made a doctors appointment and I haven’t been in five or six years because we don’t have public transpertation in my town, I can’t drive and people that could drive me always had something going on, also I have some pretty bad phone anxiety. I have no idea what I’ll need to do, because its been so long, and even before than it had been another five or so years, so I’m at a lost, but super excited that I’m finally getting things done."

happy,"I learned a new word the other day and am practicing it now.

Hurkle-durkle originates from the Scottish language which means to lounge in bed longer than when you should have gotten up.

I think I can be an Olympic class or professional hurkle-durkler.  I've been practicing so long without knowing it that I'm actually a professional my first time trying!!!!   

May everyone have at least one hurkle-durkle day a week."

happy,Been slightly over 2 and a half years sober but my third birthday sober...working towards my third year this August and this pupper means the world to me. Hes my little buddy and I owe him so much.
happy,"Basically what the title says. I don't really have anyone else to share this with, but I feel quite accomplished. My story is basically growing up poor, a bunch of federal and private loans to get a degree (out of state, had to escape the crabs in that barrel), loan to get a decent vehicle, and then I got a job as far away as I could manage. Now, just shy of my 27th birthday, all of my loans are paid off right as my employer is paying to send me back to get a master's degree in my field (I start next term). It feels like I'm free, truly free, for the first time in my life. "
happy,"I think I’ve done really well. I’ve been with my beautiful wife for 30 years, my two children are loved, well adjusted, educated and emotionally whole. I am financially stable, in love, calm and have the family of my dreams. I have burnt a lot of bridges removing myself from narcissistic parents and siblings, doing everything I can to break the cycle of toxicity and destruction. Both my wife and I are true survivors and are each other’s best friends."
happy,"Poor thing was almost dried up. I put it in my houseplant, watered it, and stuck some dead leaves in the pot. Looking a little more closely at the pictures, I could’ve nursed it a little longer (was worried the pot was too small for it), but I tried my best. I didn’t see it at the time. Nonetheless, I am so glad it’s alive and better!
Wanted to share our little victory with someone🪱"
happy,I can’t even describe this. I feel so light and nice and light and my head is spinning 
happy,"If any of yall remember, a few weeks ago i had discovered a nest of blue eggs in my easter themed wreath. Since then we have caution taped the door and all four eggs have hatched!!! They seem to be House finch eggs as some of you correctly predicted!!! Happy late easter everyone and have an awesome week!!!"
happy,Edit: Guys I’m blown away from the feedback. I wasn’t expecting this to get as much love as it did. I think it just goes to show that happiness can be simple and doesn’t require any extravagant justifications for sharing your feelings. r/happy is such a great community. 
happy," I am so happy. Today I was able to get my own room after having been homeless for a few months. Lost my job and previous home and this last two years have been rough, but definitely back on track now. What a blessing!

 Edit: Can't really believe this got so much attention. Your messages feel amazing to me and I would love to post more of it as I save up and can start upgrading some things and making the room more 'mine'.

Much love to everyone!"

Started a new job in February and became fast friends with Amanda. Her friendship means the world to me. Even though she is 18 years younger than me. We just love being friends. Yesterday we got our nails done and had dinner and drinks.

We even got drinks that look like us 😂🤣"
happy,"I was being intimate with a white guy and I’m an awkward person so I said I had “hair extensions” and he didn’t mind. He didn’t care at all. He treated me like a normal person… he even touched my head gently a couple of times which made my hairstyle a bit messy but nothing bad happened.

I’m young and the reason I wear wigs is I don’t want to hear damage my real hair :3"
happy,Was starting to feel worthless. I could cry I’m so stoked.
happy,"Update

I was going through a bad state well was about to but I got through it because of one special girl that I have been with for 3 months yes we are long distance but I got to see her for 2 days and that was the happiest I have been since my popow I feel amzing right now I really love her thank you for all the kind comments last time 😁"
happy,"I came out to my parents about being non binary (AFAB) when I was 16, I've known it since I was 15 and rn I'm 20. So it's been a long time and I'm quite sure of myself about who I am and how I feel.
A few years ago my mom kept telling me that it was a phase and my dad even told me that I was just following a trend that that if I ever did anything to make my body appear less feminine then he wonnt consider me his child anymore... Other than that everything was great in my life.

But now my parents are suddenly trying to accept me!
I have no idea what changed but today my mom came to my room to give me some of my dad's old clothes, we're going to attend a wedding soon so I needed good clothes for that, and she gave me my dad's old suit!
I was so happy that for the first time she didn't ask me to wear a dress, and my dad accepted to lend me his old clothes for a formal event without trying to convince me to wear something else first😁😁😁
And when I tried everything on my mom looked at me and I could see all the love in her eyes and she just said ''you're becoming a beautiful person''
I almost cried, I'm french so we have a very binary language and she used the word joli/jolie which means beautiful but it sounds the same way no matter if it's masculine or feminine (unlike beau/belle), and she said person and not young woman as she usually did

I'M SO HAPPY 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
They're both 50+ and they're actually trying to change how they acted and how they were raised (like considering anything LGBT+ just a young people trend) to accept me as me 🥰 I love them so much and I just want to share that joy with everyone and anyone right now 🥳❤️"

So i am 18m a okay looking guy i would say. I have been going to the gym for about 2 years. Last sommer i start going 5 times a week. This other guy i have no idea what has name is and i think hes 15. Wanted a spot and we talked a bit. We talk a bit every time. Today he asked me if he could join my work out. You dont undstand how happy i was about to cry. He looks op to me and it makes me so happy. 

A bit about me i am a stupid guy never been smart was fat as a kid. I work in connection. And this guy looks op to me!

Just want to say it told my mom she didn't care

happy,"So I just impulsively bought train tickets to visit my boyfriend tomorrow! I had a few off days in work but the plane ticket was too expensive, so instead I bought the train tickets which will take around 10 hours to his city, nevertheless I bought it and by the time he’ll be finished with his job, he will see me waiting in front of his office which he has no idea about ! I can’t sleep thinking I’ll get to see him tomorrow and what kind of reaction he’ll be having ! Just today he was complaining that I came for only 4 days previous month & it’s not enough, we should be together more often and stuff!

I've been severely depressed since I was young, a lot of people told me to ""die"", or that ""I definitely wouldn't make it to adulthood"" (guess what, bitches). Eighteen years old is like a baby that can vote, I have a lot to figure out. I'm just beginning life. 

I'll treat myself tomorrow, I'll order in a LOT of food, and binge watch my favorite movie saga. I'm so proud of myself!!! 😎"

He drove all the way to get me from the tow shop, drove to my hotel and stayed with me so I wouldn't be suffering alone because lawd I was some pain from being jarred so hard! Despite the dramatic start, our second date weekend was amazing!

As my puppy was one of those 5%, would I allow her to become a tester for their company? Heck yes, I'll let her do that.

Imaging my future

  
A future where I’m with my future daughter and I’m pushing her on a swing

  
She’s smiling so much and laughing and calling me daddy.

  
\-you can make it weird, but honestly it was super cute

  
I could clearly see her face so happy

  
Then another time

  
We’re at the beach and she’s older, a teenager

  
And the next scene I’m on my death bed with 5-7 kids around me

  
I’m smiling and they’re crying

  
In the present, the me who is sitting at my work desk is also smiling befause I’ve realised

  
There is no reason to be stressed

  
Thjngs can’t be bad forever, they never are, the only way to make it out of a stressful situation is to keep going and having hope.

  
Key lesson: start doing positive future visualisations when you’re lost.

  
They’ll change your life

happy,"Where I live, there’s practically nothing on this road, other than apartment complexes, a school, a few house (all neighbors in the houses get along really well-) and a little corner store ran by an older Asian woman.

I am the type of girl who wears that ‘emo aesthetic’ as my mom calls it, but really I wear skater/street wear and it drives her insane. Today I am meant to go to a meeting and dress nice, so I put on a cute little dress and a cardigan matched with black heels my sister let me borrow.

My mom asked me to go get some coffee from the store, and I accepted happily so I can see the Asian lady since I actually enjoy the small talk we have when I’m checking out. When walking there however, my heel had broken outside her store, and I went in any ways with a hop, and went to get the coffee, but she had stopped me.

She took a look at what happend, and the grabbed green string and told to kneel down, and I did. She started wrapping the heel in string, and fixed it temporarily. I thanked her Atleast 20 times before I had checked out and joked about it with her for a bit.

She really made my day so much better and I can’t thank her enough, even if the trying didn’t hold all the way there and back, it still was a nice feeling and made me really happy."
happy,"At 9:56 am today my boyfriend (m23) of 4 years and I (f21) both randomly  texted each other ""I love you ❤️"" while we were apart and it just made me smile. I was in my social work course watching a mock therapy group and one of the girls said her partner is her comfort person and I thought of him because he's mine. He told me that ""dreams"" by the cranberries was playing at his work (🥺) and it reminded him of me (omfg I'm winning). Life is funny and this just really reminded me that there are people who love you and think about you even when you're not around. "
happy,"I (25m) have been going out with a coworker of mine (23f) for about a month now after flirting for a few weeks before that. I've been pretty gushy the whole time, but she has some baggage from a past relationship ship that's made it hard for her to fully commit to relationship. 

Well last week, one of our other coworkers told me that she actually refered to me as her boyfriend for the first time while complaining that our manager didn't give us more shifts together, and a couple days ago she called me for the first time instead of the texting we've been doing to tell me she loves me. 

This is my first relationship since a meaningless highschool situationship, and I am just over the moon and need to get this off my chest"
happy,"Yesterdays workout turned into a slightly longer session than planned. I bought myself a luxurious licorice pipe (not the usual (Swedes knows which one I mean) , but an unknown, more expensive fancy variant!) and planned to treat myself after the session if I did well. The session felt... meh. I go to the reception to return a belly belt I borrowed for maxing out on the leg press, and then I see a guy yelling and causing a scene because his gym card is canceled for some reason. He's loud and creating an aggressive atmosphere. The receptionist is young and thin (less than 50kg), looking very uncomfortable. She has called the police. I try to talk to him.

- If you can't get in, and she only sees that it's blocked, and asks you to contact customer service, then there's nothing more to do. It's not her fault that your gym card is blocked.

But he talks about how badly he's being treated and tries to turn it into a racist thing.

- Call the police, do it! I'm not leaving this place!

And that I'm on the wrong side of what's right and wrong in the world.

- I swear to God! Jalla!

He gets up on a chair and starts waving and screaming even more. I tell him that when he's threatening and aggressive, it's not okay. It's still not her fault. If she asks you to leave, you have to leave. She's the one in charge here.

But he refuses to listen and just keeps rambling about... I don't really know what. That if it were the other way around, he wouldn't be treated this way, and blah blah blah. I wasn't on the HUMAN side, but on the INHUMAN side!

Mkay. Sure, but now she's asking you to leave. She can't do anything about it. He tries to call customer service, but as they don't answer at this time, he gets upset about how unfair it is. Gets up on the chair again, screaming and waving, hitting the lights above him, causing them to flicker. After maybe twenty long minutes of meaningless ranting, three police officers finally come and remove him, and talks to the receptionist.

I go back and stretch a bit. After a while, she comes by, and I see that she is upset and close to tears. First, she apologizes for what happened; it's not something I should have to endure. But she was glad that I was there and handled the situation. I say no worries, it was obvious I had to do something. And SHE shouldn't have to endure this at work. 

I go shower and sauna, and when I'm done and on my way going through the gym to the entrance, I see her again, and ask if she likes licorice. 

-Yes, she answers curiously. I offer her my luxury licorice pipe. She is surprised and wonders if I don't want it for myself. I say it would have been my reward if I had a good session, but it was meh. And, I think she should have something good happening today. She thanked me and said it made her very happy! And that made me happy too, despite the bad session. Win-win! "
happy,"My parents and grandparents gave me a surprise party for my birthday (not too far from now) and almost all my friends were there, including one that is like an older sister to me. They got me the best gifts I could ever ask for. I'm over the  moon and so grateful for them, and, honestly, I forgot the party was technically about me because I was busy thinking about them and how happy they've made me.

So, although this comes from a total stranger, you always have somebody who will come through for you. And if you don't yet, you will. There's always somebody."
happy,"Hi, just posting here because I like the vibe and everyone sub talking about jobs is depressing and bleh. I have a question, I was recently hired into the bank 6 months ago with no prior experience and I am loving it. I recently got a promotion and I'm starting to stress because I don't know where I want this to take me. I'm very excited, as I know I will do very well but I want to try to refine what I want to do so I have more of a direction but have no idea how to find out what I wanna do. Also, how do I relax and enjoy my life, instead of always thinking about work and where I could do better, Thanks!!"
happy,"Made lunch clearly not fancy lol. But lovely to feel mentallyand physically okay to and wanted to after a awful time and physical pain and as he always makes me gorgeous food, proud of him and its a sunny day ❤️"
happy,"When we were kids, our immediate family was pretty low-income. So when we were visiting, our grandpa would often take a few of the grandkids to “grab coffee” from a well known donut shop. We’d get there and he’d say to the employees, “A black coffee and a whatever these guys want.” 

My brother and I would have mere seconds to select a single donut from the wall of deliciousness, and I often would feel overwhelmed with choice in the moment. We loved going to “grab coffee” with grandpa. 

Fast-forward about 25 years or so, and my brother and I live far from our hometown in different states. I text him and he absolutely remembered getting donuts with Grandpa, so with a bit of planning, we roped a friend of mine in who still lives in the old stomping grounds. 

This morning, I called my grandpa, then added my brother to the call. Grandpa is 87, and had to put us on speakerphone because one of his hearing aids needed to be charged. We chat to him for a moment, then my friend (and his mom, who used to go to church with my grandpa) rolls up with a box of donuts and a black coffee. 

Grandpa was surprised and a little confused at first, but was delighted that we remembered his coffee after all these years. Then he hung up on us (most of his phone calls don’t last more than 60 seconds) so he could chat to my friend and his mom. 

Honestly, it was such a delight to organize something unexpected for such a generous and caring gentleman who had such an impact on me and my brother. 

TL/DR grandpa used to take us to get donuts so we had donuts delivered to him even though we live far away."
happy,"I gave birth ten months ago and it's been a struggle to have the discipline to get into a bedtime routine but now that I have, I have time to do some yoga before going to sleep. It feels like a huge accomplishment and I feel so much happier now that I'm getting back into physical exercise"
happy,"2 years ago, when I told my family and friends I wanted to release all original music as a fully independent artist, and try to turn it into a full time living, almost everyone I knew didn’t believe I’d get very far… I know realistically the vast majority of people that try don’t get far, so I could understand where they were coming from (the music industry is insanely hard to make a living in). But I would never know if I didn’t try…So I did. And I worked so hard, and so many times I asked myself why I was doing this…So many times I wanted to give up. But looking at this milestone, I feel very happy and proud that I didn’t give up. I’m also earning a decent part time income from my music too! The next goal is full time! Just thought I’d share this, and to not give up on your dreams if you truly love doing them! :)
"
happy,"A few days ago my co worker complimented me on my hair. She said that it's in perfect condition and that she loves it.
Yesterday I met up with my dearest friends, and my friend's girlfriend told me how she was chatting with her friend some time ago, and they both agreed on how I looked like I came straight out of a movie last time we met.
Ngl, lately I didn't feel good about my appearance, so this really lifted my spirit. I thought I was going to melt both of these times lol.
"
happy,"my friend tara is going to study marine conservation in Cape Town, South Africa in the summer! i went to study there last summer and i rly enjoyed it. we are not very close but i always see her outfits and they look rlly intricate. i wish her all the best. i struggle sometimes, but seeing her happy helps me have hope."
happy,"For context there's this one character that I absolutely adore from an old book series I love, we'll call him H. I've known H for just a year and he has been the biggest comfort character out there. I relate to his character and his upbringing, and his own character has managed to actually make me realize more things of myself and grow as a person. I also even write fanfiction of him, which I feel like is average for a girl my age so I am not that embarrassed. I also of course have a deep crush on him which I joke of with my friends, calling H my boyfriend and such (secretly I actually love these jokes, though I'm too shy to admit that, haha). In other words, H is an amazing character and I am surprised he is not anywhere near mainstream! Though I am glad as I can keep him all to myself now, haha.

I was having a rough day that day, my period had started, my dad was pestering about me going to high school (for health reasons I'll never be able to attend one which upset me a lot), and I was stressing over a theme coding project I had been working on for two days as a gift for a friend. I finished the code early this day and was too scared of sending it to my friend because I deemed it 'aesthetically unpleasing'. In the end I did send it, and then immediately deleted it. But then I realized that I deleted it too late, as now my friend had the code file. The absolute panic I felt in that moment before he revealed to me that he actually liked it! But what I didn't expect was for him to send something back for me. The squeal I let out when I saw it one would think I had won a million dollars! :) It was a drawing of H and me! Let me tell you that my friend is probably one of the best artists I've ever known or seen, so to get a drawing was a blessing itself. But a personal one of my ultimate teen girl fantasy no matter how cringe it was? My heart clenched and I swear I started to feel tears bubbling up inside of me. I am still continuing on expressing my gratefulness to him hours later lol.

He didn't even have to do that for me, yet he did. I am so grateful of my best friend and I absolutely love him with all my heart. It's things like these that make me grateful of meeting him and also of other people in my life, and that I am not truly alone. I wish I realized sooner how much he has done for me. Each time I think about it my eyes brim up with emotional and absolute happy tears. I've been so used to gifts and presents that never truly fit my interests or were considerate enough, but he? He knows me too well to know how to make me the happiest girl in the world. We both jokingly call each other brothers from another mothers, but I realize that I genuinely see him as one, which is making me far too emotional too living as an only child and being the only teen in my family and relatives, so I never had a close relationship like that with someone around my age.

Lesson of the day (for me at least) is that you are never truly alone, and that there are people out there who will embrace any part of you, even your embarrassing fictional crushes. And to also tell my friends more that I love them. :)"
happy,"This was filmed at their album release party this past January. I think it rocks and wanted to share. They’re on Spotify and are already ready for a second album this summer. Really happy for him, he’s the guitarist in the cowboy hat and wrote this instrumental!"
happy,"I love him so very, very much."
happy,"my friend tara is going to study marine conservation in Cape Town, South Africa in the summer! i went to study there last summer and i rly enjoyed it. we are not very close but i always see her outfits and they look rlly intricate. i wish her all the best. i struggle sometimes, but seeing her happy helps me have hope."
happy,I still feel happy to be a part of this country 😊 flaws of course but how else would I be able to help if not becoming a citizen. 
happy,"I can't believe I know how to play chess now. I always shunned it because I thought it required way too much thinking for it to be any kind of fun game, but now that I know how the pieces move, I feel like I can do a lot more intellectual things. Really, I learned how to play for two reasons: I quit two of my greatest addictions and really needed something new to occupy my mind. The other reason is because someone once asked me if I knew how to play chess, and it came off as them questioning my intelligence, and I didn't like that at all. So, now I finally know how to play and have so much more I can learn, which is great because I have so much time on my hands.

I'm having a blast! I can't believe I never took the time to learn this very great game. I'm so happy!"
happy,"my boyfriend and i are both 16. were immature, sometimes a little petty, but undoubtedly in love. my mother died before i met him, but since he’s known me he’s supported me through the grief of losing her and even has visited her grave by himself on his own time. he helps me talk about her, and says that he wishes he could have known her. it means more than he knows.

i come from a drug addict mother and angry father, so my model for a relationship wasn’t the best. i’ve messed up with him, i’ve said things i didn’t mean when i was upset, but he’s been nothing but patient with me. he’s taught me how to talk things out and admit when i’m upset about something, and to not harbor my emotions.

he’s making me a better person, and i love him unconditionally. he’s the first person i’ve been comfortable enough to let him see every single side of me, mentally and behaviorally. anyways, just wanted to say there are still good people out there, and everyone deserves someone who treats them the way my boyfriend treats me!! "
happy,I’m living proof that we *DO* recover!
happy,GRAD SCHOOL HERE I COME WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
happy,"I'm celebrating today!
I found out a lot about myself during this year because of reddit and people here.

thank you all, folks!"
happy,"I (19M) turned 19 on Tuesday last week and my girlfriend (19F) made it so special for me. She bought me a huge bunch of flowers and I legit cried so hard in her arms. Ive never been given flowers before and it meant so so much to me. For anyone reading this, buy someone you care about a bunch of flowers it will make their entire year!!!!"
happy,"This is so weird , but a few days ago my boyfriend and I went into a little no-contact stage after a small argument we had over something petty . 

It wasn’t specific or anything but we both just stopped reaching out and got busy . 


Well yesterday after like 2 days of no contact , I go to message him on instagram and the second my message delivered, I received a message from him on text message 😂 

We literally messaged each other at the exact same moment after 2 days and were thinking of each other exactly at the same moment 

So adorable haha "
happy,Today is day 1 of no contact after being married to a narcissist for 8 years this is the hardest thing I have ever done in my life I’ve lived through the abuse the torture the cheating the lies and yet I miss them but today I started making a list every time I want to call them I add to that list a reminder of all the things my brain made me forget all these years I am hoping this is day 1 of a life without being controlled 
happy,"As an artist, I’ve never been as prolific as I have been this year and even though I beat myself up about it, it’s amazing to think back on the year about ALL the paintings I have done. I’ve probably done over twenty or thirty paintings this year of varying sizes and this was after YEARS of doing maybe just less than a handful. I think last year I did two or three. Prior to this year I was making friends who didn’t even know I was a painter or went to school for art. I’m proud to say that narrative has vastly shifted! I’m so proud of myself for painting more even though it’s really hard to get started some days."
happy,Not to Jinx myself and I'm knocking on wood. But next week I've been at my job eleven years. It makes me happy because growing up I had learning issues and was in special Ed. And the teachers were not nice. I was told I would never go to college and ide never hold a job. I have so far done both. And I feel..well proud of myself in a way I've beaten odds and expectations. I was told i would be nothing but a failure.
happy,"Feeling so good and carefree, almost unreal rn and wanted to share it just somewhere hehe"
happy,"There was this local Mexican joint housed inside a run-down, little-used gas station. Classic ""hole in the wall"" type setup, which should have been this community's first clue that the food would be stupendous. They had these chorizo burritos with spicy sauce that just spoke to me on some metaphysical level.

Unfortunately, last summer they announced they were shutting down. They just weren't making enough money. I was despondent -- nothing else in this two-horse town even came close to approximating the culinary excellence this place provided.

They reopened yesterday. I was finally able to get in there today, and I swear to you that the clouds parted and angels sang as I took my first bite. It's every bit as good as I remembered.

I'm recommending them to everybody I know and hoping they manage to hold on this time."
happy,Today I found out that I passed my Calc II exam with an 88%! I’m happy that I got that high of a score!
happy,I've never experienced love like this before. I'm actually happy now ☺️
happy,"Just needed to get off my chest how happy I’m feeling rn in my relationship. We’re definitely not perfect but my fiancé tries really hard to make me happy and really listens and takes on board anything I have to say. It helps that he’s a complete lefty and the biggest feminist I know, we share all the same values and have the same morals. We’ve been together 3 and a half years now, I have a child with my ex husband and a child with my fiancé. He treats both kids and loves both kids the same, he’s a brilliant dad and I feel so lucky. 

My heart feels happy ♥️"
happy,"Is it girl math when you're on your weight loss journey and you're down 2-3 dress sizes so you have to buy new clothes but it's okay cos smaller clothes are cheaper than plus size anyway?

Oh who cares! I'm down almost 3 dress sizes!! I'm doing AMAZING!

THE ONLY WAY IS DOWN!! 🥳"
happy,"I started a music project with two of my best friends a couple of years ago.  After releasing our first album I reached out to an author / reviewer to get feedback on what we'd put together.  I didn't get any feedback the first time around: this person was super busy so I didn't take any offence.  After releasing our second album I reached out again, still hopeful we'd get a listen.  It turns out this person liked our work quite a bit!  We got some very kind compliments.  I'm still smiling a day later. "
happy,"Man oh MAN!!! First off, im absolutely fucking ZOOTED off a 5mg candy. 2nd today was so freakin FUN! Long story short, i have been sober but a 5 year streak of Alcoholism. I slowed down to only on special occasions starting on my birthday (July 31) of last year, only drank christmas, thanksgiving, and once a week before christmas because i had found out my dad needed heart bypass surgery, last try out drink was a shot in February of this year and i have not drank SHIT since. Anyways, today i took my brother to the dispensary. It was his first time and i said it was on me. I got home and i felt so good i just wanted to share. 

Ive always wanted to cross of my bucket list have a first experience with one of my siblings. I know thats a odd experience but the way my brother was excited to go with me was so filling. It was just the fact that we got to enjoy a shared interest. although i do not condone drug use if it is illegal in your state, like i said, sharing a similar interest together was great. He even said “Next time i get paid, it’s on me.” 

Today was great. I feel so whole again. My heart feels so light for the first time in years and im just so excited to enjoy more things in life after feeling so low for such a long time. 
"
happy,"I know I know; every community has it's toxic weeds that grow.

But so far my experience on Reddit has been like a walk in the park, and I'm just happy to read so many well written, sad, happy, funny, thought provoking, and interesting  posts/stories!

I always heard Reddit getting made fun of for the most part (and for good reason at times well deserved ofc) and even heavily bashed or told it was a ""cesspool of nasty to absolutely stay away from"".

 I stayed away for a long time, like the plague indeed, but I thought, ""Why not personally give it a shot,"" and see what happens, eh?

Never been a big social media person anyway since I'm not the best at being social, writing, taking pics, or navigating around strangers, so I'm beyond impressed so far with the community and am just happy my experience thus far has been good. :) 

And I'm just giddy to see what great, terrible, hilarious, irksome, and strange posts are yet to come.
Not to be sappy, I'm just happy to enjoy something new and am trying to find happy things to experience, especially with how lucky I am to be alive now.

Simple pleasures are my go to and I'm just getting older and more years are silently passing by. 
And I'm learning how to be a better writer thanks to y'all! I haven't written since high school, and am falling in love all over again with this hobby. 

I haven't seen such good writing, interesting stories, or funny jokes in ages. Impressed and can't wait to be more impressed and, somehow, even let down someday 😅if that even is something to look forward to."
happy,"A close encounter of the saintly kind…

…At the grocery store with my daughter. She’s little, so tends to have the “Please, buy me everything!” anytime we’re in the store. Most of the time she’s fine with a “Not today, sweetie.” but today, she was in her feels because ALLLLLLLL of the day-after Valentine’s Day items were smack dab in front of the door when we walked in. She wanted a balloon. Mommy said “Not today, sweetie.” and today, that “not today” didn’t go over very well. She proceeded to be very pouty. Meh, it happens. 

Well, we’re in an aisle looking for artichoke hearts and there stood a kindly, bespectacled, affable looking gentleman. I asked his pardon as we passed. We started making small talk after he tried to engage my daughter and she made it very clear that she wanted a balloon and wasn’t allowed to have one. He laughed and looked at me chuckling. “It doesn’t get easier as they get older!” to which I replied “She’s six… pray for me!” 

The kindly gentleman (before we learned his name) knelt down and said to my daughter “You know… balloons are wonderful, but they are often the best when they’re surprises, so maybe you can look forward to getting one when you least expect it.” This seemed to go over well with my daughter. 

The kindly gentleman (Mr. Myles, I came to know) and I continued chatting about kids, life, and random musings, eventually parting with a genuine sense of happiness over the entire interaction. He proceeded to the front of the store and my daughter and I continued our shopping. 

A few moments later, he found us at the back of the store with a heart shaped balloon. With the biggest smile ever, he handed it to my daughter and said “See? Isn’t it so much better when it’s a surprise?” I was dumbfounded, more tickled pink than I’d been in a while and said “You’re an absolute angel! No wait- a Saint! Thank you Saint Myles!” 

Random acts of kindness are the best. In a world full of curmudgeonly behavior- be like Myles."
happy,"It feels like I’m dreaming. Two of the hardest years of my life are finally over. I also got a job offer yesterday. Everything always works out in the end, I just never thought that it would work out this good."
happy,I remember just a few months ago I couldn't even do 10! Let alone get down and do some more afterwards!
happy,I’m 44. Never thought I’d have kids. Today that changed. Say hi to Annie.
happy,"So it started in 2020, We met while playing roblox i
approached her, (yes she was a girl im not gonna namedrop) we played roblox day and night enjoying games, we
chatted in the roblox chat feature whenever we weren't playing some chats lasted 3 hours, it was enjoyable until she stopped chatting, everytimee then we could
only communicate every 1 month and so with such
short messages, Thats when she told me she had a
new account, there is when it started we stopped talking completely- Skip to 2022- she told me her new account
and i understood why we couldnt talk much, and then after a few conversations and games, She disappeared completely i was really worried - Skip to 2023-2024-in 2023 i kept chatting her updating new stuff that happened in my life, i missed her completey even if we are just online friends, shes gone.. One last message in 2024 on january

wont repeat again i dont want to lose her, Im going to do everything i can. (I want you guys advice on this, pls tell me your thoughts..)"
happy,Yum!!
happy,"Basically what the title says. I don't really have anyone else to share this with, but I feel quite accomplished. My story is basically growing up poor, a bunch of federal and private loans to get a degree (out of state, had to escape the crabs in that barrel), loan to get a decent vehicle, and then I got a job as far away as I could manage. Now, just shy of my 27th birthday, all of my loans are paid off right as my employer is paying to send me back to get a master's degree in my field (I start next term). It feels like I'm free, truly free, for the first time in my life. "
happy,Just wanted to share. 
happy,"I actually have a small business based on that. I sell home baked goodies around the holidays. I know my baking, it's good since I get so many customers I have to refuse the newer ones. It can't be otherwise, I use high quality ingredients and respect de recipe religiously. 

I've got compliments before but never from my friends. Not from my past friends or boyfriend. At least nothing more than ""yeah it's fine"" or ""it's good"" and that after insisting to take a bite. I remember I'd be so discouraged when my ex would prefer a burnt brownie over at least trying something I made. 

So yesterday we were at the canteen talking about small businesses. I never mentioned I had one. My friend sujested I should start one since my baking is so good. She said I'd make her so happy when I invited her over for dinner. She even has some pictures marked as favorite in her phone. She then said she never tried something like it till then. I can't remember all of it but she continued praising it to my other friend. 

I am so lucky having around people that genuinely love me! It really felt sincere. For the first time from a friend and not a customer."
happy,"I know it's not a huge deal but after a lot of research and taking my time I successful did a full brake job on my vehicle. I've been driving it for a week now and it's been a smooth ride, great braking and just overall really happy that I was able to complete it. In a way it really built some significant confidence for myself. I usually just do my own oil changes so this was a big step forward."
happy,Mum has been helping me orchestrate so she knows I'm coming back- I haven't seen my family since Christmas and I've especially missed my little sister so I decided instead of staying at uni for reading week I'm gonna go home and surprise her!
happy,So today I went for a run. Now when I starred I was doing interval training which I still do but today I made through half my route without getting winded or slowing down to walk. I feel amazing. I'm so happy when I make progress. 
happy,"I was tired of my life. I woke up one day and realized I have been “winging” it and “half-assing” through life. I’m not in a terrible place. I have a decent paying management job in infrastructure. But this wasn’t the life young me wanted.

I got accepted in college and I’m about to start classes. I scored insanely well on the accuplacer (after countless hours studying). And the end goal is to finally pursue my dream and become a lawyer. It was my dream all as a child. But I spent too much time in high school skipping class and hitting the reefer. I graduated high school with a 2.0 GPA. I didn’t even understand math at all. I had Fs in every math class. But I self taught my self advance algebra and statistics in a matter of weeks before my test. And I’m so proud of that. (I was proud when I was doing 7th grade math test and passing lol) 

I’m sharing on here because I’m divorced and kinda alone. No one is by my side to share the joy with me. And all my coworkers laughed at me and one of my coworkers (who dropped out in 7th grade) keeps telling me how dumb I am for doing it. I just wanted to get it off my chest in a safe area because I’m genuinely stoked. 

This is a massive vent and humble brag. "
happy,Edit: Guys I’m blown away from the feedback. I wasn’t expecting this to get as much love as it did. I think it just goes to show that happiness can be simple and doesn’t require any extravagant justifications for sharing your feelings. r/happy is such a great community. 
happy,"Dropped out of college in 2013, became a licensed cosmetologist in my state… worked hair full time for 9 years. Went back to school. 

Graduated, passed exams. I am a certified nurse aide. "
happy,"i've so many years hating my voice, i never like recording my voice or send voice messages, until a few days ago i recorded a video, when i was playing it that i noticesd that my voice changed since last time i recording my voice (maybe 4 yrs ago), my voice used to soud like the cracky puberty nerd voice... now i feel good about my voice and love how thad sounds. could sound sptupid but i feel good about that change, sounds more like an adult (i'm about 30yrs old), idk if my voice change or my perception changed but i feel more comfortable."
happy,I (F18) talked to the army three months ago about joining just for the fun of it. I had no idea that I could get trained as an LPN. (I want to be a doctor one day so this will get me started in building my career) I signed my contract at MEPs yesterday. I'm really excited to be able to go to college and be able to move out of my parent's house!! 
happy,"Today I've been feeling stressed due to personal family issues, and I've been mentally ruminating on these issues for 1-2 hours. When I got to the gym (thankfully by myself) I was still ruminating. That changed when I got to my last exercise, sumo deadlifts (I like to save the best exercises for last). I hit a 5 RM sumo deadlift today, and my mood was uplifted. 

Now I'm happy AND proud I hit a milestone!! :)"
happy,I wish I was this good at waiting 
happy,"So, this was my first year applying to physical therapy school and I managed to get accepted everywhere I applied. I even have a soft offer for a paid research assistant position for work similar to what I did in undergrad!

I understand that PT school isn't the best financial decision for most people, but I did accept my offer at a relatively cheap school. Beyond that, I grew up with a single mom and my first paycheck will be more than she has ever made! It just feels like all the work is paying off and I am making progress towards my goals."
happy,"Backstory: my grandfather played for Ike & Tina Turner in the 60’s. He “retired” from playing about 12 years ago, but tonight I convinced him to play one last time to end 2023. 
The sax he’s playing is a Buescher Aristocrat built in 1949 that was purchased for him by his father. He gifted me the saxophone for my 26th birthday & I start lessons next week. 
I’m infinitely proud of him & have some big shoes to fill. Happy New Year! 🎉"
happy,"My boyfriend and I almost always play pool during our lunch break, more often than not betting something per game. Well, the bet we're cashing in this weekend is something I'm really looking forward to! We're gonna lay out blankets and pillows galore in the living room, introduce him to Star Wars for May 4th, order some ramen, snuggle puddle with my bunny (he loves my bf), and add pictures to our lovey dovey scrapbook.   
  
This man is so sweet, I'm truly able to let out my hopeless romantic side with him and get it right back without hesitation. Not to mention I just renewed my lease and we added his name to it! Having a safe and healthy love is one of the greatest feelings in the world. I love and adore him, and feel so giddy knowing he's just as crazy about me, too. :)"
happy,"Over 2 years ago, a friend of ours passed away leaving 3 kids orphaned and a half sibling without a support system. My wife and I took in all 4 kids, as we were quite close with the kids. We got legal guardianship of the 2 youngest about 6 months after they moved in. The youngest is now 10. She started calling my wife ""Mommy"" about a year ago. This took some getting used to as all of our other kids call her ""Mom"". 

I however, remained Mr. MyFirstName. She has never had a dad before, and she had always called me that before she moved in. She gives me hugs everyday (now) and tells me she loves me frequently (yes, I know this won't last). So I was not worried about what she calls me. We went on a trip with my brother and his family, and sometime during the week, she just started calling me ""Daddy"". I'm not sure if it was because her cousin (my niece - 6F) calls my brother Daddy (a lot) or what caused it. At one point, we were at a theme park, and she was calling me Daddy over and over again, and I completely missed it, because I wasn't used to it and her voice is similar to my niece. My SIL grabs my arm and says ""Daddy!!!  Someone is calling you"". I felt awful, and so overjoyed at the same time. We've been home several days and I'm still Daddy (and getting used to it), but also Mr. MyFirstName sometimes too, but it still makes me smile.

  
We are hoping the adoption will be finalized this year. "
happy,"I'm celebrating today!
I found out a lot about myself during this year because of reddit and people here.

thank you all, folks!"
happy,"I'm genderfluid and used to be FTM but decided to stop taking testosterone at the end of last year so my periods have been incredibly painful. 

In fact one of the many reasons I started to take it to begin with when I was 18 was years old and prior to that my period cramps were unbearable to the point I went to the hospital (probably due to low iron). 

My lover is an accomplished music producer and has a Dragon Ball cover song he's trying to wrap up for his audience on YouTube as soon as possible and while he's more than happy to have my company, he has to fully focus on his projecting order to meet his deadline. 

My time of month came in a few days ago and my cramps have been pretty intense, and he did have to experience having to see / hear me deal with all of the pain. 

So last night while he was focused and I was watching and episode of My Hero Academia he was letting his project play in the back ground, snuck behind me and started to give me the most amazing back rub in the universe. 

We already have such a wonderful and wholesome relationship but this made me feel so nice and relieved I wanted to post about it. His older brother is an RMT so his family definitely had some some of gene of being good with their hands when it comes to massages 🤤"
happy,"Posted my cat cause I didn't wanna out a picture of my new niece but I'm so happy! Things are truly looking up right now! 😁 Don't be afraid of job interviews like I am and push through it! It's so worth it and I have ppl around me cheering me on, feels amazing!"
happy,"This is very small, but I haven't stopped thinking about it since it happened and it makes me happy! Sorry, this might get long.

I have a weird role at my job and it was created when I was hired so there were no processes or procedures in place. It's listed as a Customer Experience Specialist role, but I am involved in every aspect of the company. One thing that's evolved, that definitely wasn't part of the job, is that coworkers confide in me knowing I have a ""loose lips sink ships"" mentality. I never reveal details or gossip, but if I'm concerned about something/someone I'll roundabout bring it up to management. 

On Friday one of my direct teammates was venting pretty hard and I went to my manager to say I was concerned this person may be experiencing burnout and I'm not sure how long they'll be with the company.  My boss said he noticed it too and if they need to leave for their mental wellbeing it's understandable and there are contingency plans in place. Then he said, all except you, there's no contingency plan if we lose you. 

Folks, I know everyone is replaceable, but this made me feel so valued and seen. I already love my job, but this was icing on the cake. 

Thank you for reading. "
happy,"i (f19) am in a long distance relationship with my gf (f22). things are really tight so i thought that maybe i wouldn’t be able to afford to get my gf much for valentine’s day. she calls me goose a lot and i ended up finding a stuffed goose that’s about my height! i also found some of her favorite candies and some face masks that she enjoys for a relatively affordable price.  i’m just super happy i got to get her some meaningful things, even if it’s not much. I included a picture of the goose (i got the largest one) :))"
happy,"She told me, ""I know what it's like to not be able to leave home, so now you can."""

happy,You’re very lovely people. I wish you happiness and peace. I pray you are blessed and have a wonderful Christmas! May it be full of laughs and good food. I wish joy on all of you. Have a great Christmas Day!
happy,"This is gonna start off sad, but I swear it gets better. 

August 2021 I graduated college. October 2021 I was given a job offer for a career I was incredibly excited about. The job offer payed decently, and was a stepping stone for my ex-gf and I at the time to be able to start moving our relationship into a more adult-relationship; ie, moving out, buying a house, etc. 

January 2022 I started at my job and loved it. March 2022 came around, and my ex at the time had blind-sided me and left without a word. I was devastated at the time. Fast forward a few months to October, I’m at the gym and I feel a tendon in the back of my leg snap. I can’t walk. I eventually go to the doctor who just diagnoses me with a strain and tells me to go to PT. 

Long story short, I visited 2 different doctors. Both of whom could not give me a proper diagnosis which caused the PT I received to only make things worse. I was on disability from my job to take care of my leg which just wouldn’t get better, as well as therapy for depression. Eventually, I was forced to leave my job, lost my health insurance, and didn’t know if I’d ever be able to walk again. I was alone, depressed, disabled, unemployed, and had no idea about the future and what was going to happen to me. 

Eventually, I found a physio who I was able to see via Zoom (about $20/visit, so I could afford it without insurance) who was able to diagnose me and we started a PT program that I was able to do by myself. It took a long time, but she got me back on my feet, back in the gym, back to running and everything. It took me about a year to walk again. It was an extremely long process. 

Near the end of my PT, I met this woman. Smart, funny, gorgeous, kind, driven and hard working, incredibly emotionally intelligent, and… well I could go on for hours talking about this woman. We hit it off, and started dating. She’s introduced me to so many new hobbies, many of which are active activities. Some team sports, and some individual sports. I’ve started some new sports of my own, and have began to introduce her to them as well. Not only has meeting her changed my life romantically, but I’ve also gotten very close to all of her friends of which she has many. When my leg didn’t work and I lost my job, I was alone almost 24/7. I had very little help with anything from family and friends. It was the darkest time of my life. Now, I feel like it’s one of the most social and happiest times of my life. It’s been a complete 180 from where I was before. 

When my leg got better, I also applied for a federal job. I’d always wanted to work for the federal government, not just for the benefits but also for the job security. It was a very long and stressful process, but just last week I received the email with a firm job offer and I am due to begin working with them next week. 

My life has completely changed. I was in the darkest time of my life, not knowing what was going to happen to me and not knowing if I’d ever be able to walk again, hold a job, etc. I’ve now picked up a handful of new hobbies, I’m exercising and running frequently, I have a new career which I’m beyond ecstatic to begin, and a wonderful girlfriend of which I can see an actual future with. 

Words cannot begin to describe how absolutely ecstatic I am for what my future holds. "
happy,Edit: Guys I’m blown away from the feedback. I wasn’t expecting this to get as much love as it did. I think it just goes to show that happiness can be simple and doesn’t require any extravagant justifications for sharing your feelings. r/happy is such a great community. 
happy,"Undergraduate Completion

This story is about my journey as a college student and the joy I have at its completion.

I started my 5-year undergraduate degree in accounting during the fall of 2018. The first year was pure bliss; I gained so many friends, lost my virginity, felt heartbreak, expanded my understanding of the world and came to love diversity. I had earned a position as an RA for my sophomore year with one of my new, and still, great friends. 

Fall of 2019 started as the Residential Department put it, ""Gaining 60 new contracted friends"". I put my life into creating the best experience for both my residents and myself. Come March of 2020, this was shattered. COVID-19 officially shut down my campus and everyone was sent home. Uncertainty of the next year lasted until summer when our accepted return was announced. With many new rules and being shipped off into a different housing area, I was apprehensive to say the least. 

Fall of 2020 was the beginning of my hidden, yet sharp, mental decline. It is here my met my most sincere and closest friends beyond my home as well. The seclusion was otherwise agonizing and I had turned to drinking on the weekends with a small group of friends for the majority of the college year.  By summer of 2021, I had landed an internship in my field of study, entered a relationship, and received a promotion from RA to CA. The internship was phenomenal and the relationship amazing, though I found myself constantly crying and was put on am anti-depressant as depression runs in my family.

Fall of 2021, I was now entering the depths of my studies, additional responsibilities from my position, and my s/o was now 2 hours away. The anti-depressants dramatically worsened my mentality and became secluded from my studies, relationship, and job all at once. I dropped 2 classes in an attempt to reduce the load, to no avail. By winter of 2022, the relationship had ended in pain from depression+guilt and my education and job faltered further. I stepped down from my role as a CA to RA and took fewer classes to start the next year. Summer of 2022 was jobless in an attempt to regain my mental fortitude. 

Fall of 2022 did not last long. Immediately I was shunted into the same routine of depressive behavior, this time accompanied by suicidal ideation. As I was failing every class and effectively not working as is, I dropped out of college just before Thanksgiving to live at home and continue online next semester. Spring of 2023 I had begun seeing a psychiatrist as well as therapist weekly. My class load was very light as I was surely going to need an extra year to graduate. I tried new medications bi-monthly and my therapist was unhelpful for myself. I completed some summer courses but sank deeper and deeper in depression. 

Fall of 2023 was the worst time of my 24 years of existence thus far. Although my course load was still light, I had no point in living. I was divising painless ways to commit suicide and preserve my body for my family. I was ready to die when I started a new medication (Cymbalta) and started seeing a new therapist.

My life changed.

This medication with a dedicated therapist who cared about me and my wellbeing rocketed me out of the 6-foot hole. Within 3 months of dedicated medication rigorous therapy, I had finally stopped my suicidal ideation. Winter of 2024 was the first time I felt alive in almost 3 years. I felt pure happiness again for the first time 1 month ago. I am alive again.

As of May 11, 2024, I have walked across the stage, accepted my diploma for accounting, and am *effectively* depression free. I breathe as this chapter is completed. I felt the sun of my skin today, felt what it is like to be human. What it is like to be alive. 

I wanted to share this joy with others in hopes to encourage growth and foster hope. I am alive and far beyond well as I work to create the best me I can for the world.

happy,"I have two beautiful kids that I love dearly and they are both my bonus children. My husband made an appointment for tomorrow to start the ball rolling on reversing his vasectomy. 

When we met he told me he didn’t really believe in marriage and he already had his children. I said I was fine with that, and I was. But time has passed and we’ve moved together and grown together. He tells me I’m the best mother he’s ever seen, that I deserve my own and that he desperately wants it too. Our kids ask us constantly when we’re going to have a baby. Hopefully we can answer that soon. 

Send us some baby dust on this Valentine’s Day. 🫶🏼"
happy,"I start my first job tomorrow!

I’m a new grad nurse currently in the Philippines, and after passing the board exam, I contacted my review center and expressed my interest in lecturing to help teach others how to pass their licensure exam.

I’m starting tomorrow and it feels like a dream came true that I didn’t even know I had. I love helping people, it’s part of why I got into nursing in the first place, and the knowledge that I can have even a small part in helping others getting to that point makes me truly happy.

The company is very easy to communicate with, I respect the hell out of my seniors, I’ll travel around the country to lecture at the other centers, and I’ll be able to use this opportunity to also help prepare myself for eventually taking the US NCLEX as well.

This year hasn’t started out great, but this is a giant W to get my mood up, and I am so greatful for the opportunity and experience."
happy,"I’m so excited. This is a job I’ve wanted for ages and I feel like people take me seriously and respect me professionally, which I’ve never really experienced as I’m still 20 and in college. 

I get to go to a new city I’ve never seen before, go to fancy dinners every night and get paid for it!! Also I feel like I’ve made my dad proud of me so that’s an added bonus. "
happy,"Howdy y'all,

A little background: so I'm autistic with a few special interests, e.g. history, aviation, and hot dogs (that one's not important, but still hot dogs are awesome, fight me lol)

Today is not my birthday, but as I'm in the middle of a grueling job search, my friends thought it important to take me out early to both cheer me up and ensure I had a day off.

That is what I assumed, at least!

Turns out these absolute a-holes tricked me and treated me to a lovely day around the city enjoying my favorite things. We went and had a fabulous breakfast before jumping ship to an aviation museum, then enjoying a day by the beach in a more touristy spot of my city before finally going to an art museum styled after a Roman Villa (the Getty Villa in Los Angeles, I highly recommend if you're ever out this way)

Now, I had a blast, but as it turns out, they had one more surprise for me.

A plane ticket to Rome with complete reservations for accommodations!

I'm having a panic attack. I don't know how to respond. I don't know how to pay them back. I'm so incredibly lucky! What could I have possibly done to deserve any of this?!"
happy,Cancer free
happy,Yum!!
happy,It's Spring! I am so happy when I hear the birds and frogs on my walk to work.
happy,Me and my wife have been together 20 years in October and married 16 in November. As long as I've known her she's been a smoker. I was a smoker myself. I finally kicked the habit three years ago. Bur my wife has been incredibly stubborn on the subject. Today we talked for a while and she decided to take steps to quit. I couldn't be happier with this decision. I'm aware that this will not he easy but she's at least willing. And I'm gonna stand by her and take all the crap that comes with quitting. If it means she can improve her health and I can have her longer I am more than willing to be her punching bag for a few weeks. I'm very proud because she really didn't want to do this. 
happy,"I love people. I find it so fascinating how incredibly intricate every single person is, and there’s billions of us! I genuinely love seeing people walking outside or at school. I’m excited to see my friends, yes, but I also love the fact that I get to see everyone else’s faces every day. I’ve never really empathized with those that say they hate the majority of people. I get being hurt and losing the ability to trust, I can understand it, but I don’t think I could really just hate people in general. I love people’s faces, not just the eyes, but the noses and the smiles and the way skin crinkles. I get so excited at the prospect of meeting new people, because that’s one more entire life I get to interact with! That person an entire world of inner thought and experiences that is allowing me to take part in their experience of the world. Idk I just really love people a whole lot."
happy,"I've been so depressed the last few months because of an incident I don't want to go into. Its been a long time since I've felt genuine happiness but today is just the perfect day. I feel so relaxed, as if all my problems just went away. There's a really nice sunset out (if only there was a few extra degrees so I could sit out on my balcony), and I'm listening to my favorite tracks on my phone. Usually those things are more of a treatment, but today its a cure. 








I feel free for the first time in so long. I wish this feeling on everyone"
happy,"“How is her brother doing?”

Weird, right? Ill make it make sense!

My best friend passed away 2 years ago, we have guardianship of her 17f daughter, and are active in her 18transM’s son’s life. We’ll call him K.

I have boomer parents. I would gently correct them when they referred to the kids as “the girls,” or used the incorrect pronouns for K. I was understanding that they were going to mess up here and there because of the generational gap, but figured after consistent gentle corrections, they would get there sooner than later.

I was wrong. After nearly 2 years, I felt I gave them more than enough grace to get it right. My mom has been the main culprit of the two because she always wants to talk about the kids, while my dad never really asked/talked about them as often (man of few words type). I started getting more aggravated and upset every time my mom would ask “how are the girls doing?” After 2 years, I just felt like my parents just didn’t care enough to even try to understand. I stopped bringing the kids around my family because I felt like it was always a negative experience for them, and refused to subject them to that kind of environment.

Fast forward to last week: I was talking to my dad on the phone. He was asking about 17f because I had mentioned she was starting school again soon and she just had a birthday. After we were done talking about her, he said the sentence:

“How is her brother doing?”

0 coaching. No correcting. Just him using his own words. 

I couldn’t believe it and actually stuttered a bit after that one sentence. That was the first time I heard one of my parents affirm his gender identity. 

My dad does care and has been listening. My heart exploded. I had hella tears.

I love my dad and am happy."
happy,"I’m kinda lonely in college I didn’t find many good friends here throughout the years, I got good friends back home though but kinda sad I can’t spend it with them bc I feel like 21 is kinda special? Maybe? But here’s to another trip around the sun of life 😄"
happy,"JNJDSB I know this might not sound like a big deal, but I've been so stressed about my storage because of how much I need for the software I want to install and because I can't convince my parents I need an additional drive because I own a lot of usbs already. But my usb with the largest storage...IT WAS NOT WORKING. *FOR YEARS.*

And so just few minutes ago, I found out...*I can reformat it, even though all the data would be erased, it would hopefully work*....

That doesn't sound that great, ***right?*** SO I PLUGGED IN MY USB TO REFORMAT IT AND IT'S PERFECTLY FINE??????????????

My guess is that a while I ago I was troubleshooting drives, transferring files, running security software and whatnot, and around that time I repaired the drive, but just didn't notice it or forgot about it. 😭

BUT I AM SO HAPPY. LIKE SO GODDAMN HAPPY. It's 1:43 am, I'm so happy I considered waking up my parents and my siblings to tell them that it works. I am so so so so so incredibly happy.

Like, there's so much things that were being held back because of this stress, and now it's like ***FREEDOM.*** **And like things are finally looking forward. AND THERE'S SO MUCH MORE I CAN DO NOW!!! SO MUCH MORE TO TEST!!!! I AM SO EXCITED.**   


AND I'M SO HAPPY THAT ALL MY FILES ARE THERE. I've been missing so many stories I've written and worked on, along with programs I've written, now I can finally get them back!!!!!!! 😁💖"
happy,"A day ago I posted about how happy and excited I was that I made a plan to visit my boyfriend suddenly! And he was surprised a lot! But today he surprised me back by proposing me 😅🥺 So apparently he had plans to propose me before but the ring wasn’t delivered on time , so he was planning to propose me later this month. But since I visited him suddenly, he took this opportunity to surprise me back by taking out the ring at this magical hike we had today. This is probably the best thing ever happened to me, the uno reverse we all need in life ! 😭🤍✌️"
happy,"We've been dating for a little over a month now and she just called me babe. No other petnames were used prior to this. I thought I honestly hate the word, and you know, maybe I still do, but it made me so insanely happy. She did use it in a joke so it might've been ironic but I do not care. I'm giggling and kicking my feet and even after sending a string of keyboard smashes and I love you's I'm giddy and need to tell somebody. Thanks for listening. I love her very much.
edit: I'm very disappointed in this community my replies explaining I'm in a poly relationship were downvoted for no reason. This sub is meant to be happy. And accepting. I changed the last sentence. Hope that makes your day better."
happy,"So I have a lazy right eye and I'm right handed for everything.  When I look through the scope I don't  have an easy time lining up the scope because my left eye is dominate and tries to take focus. When I close my left eye, my already squinty eye gets worse. So I haven't shot in years because its so hard. 

I decided I needed a new hobby that got me outside so I started practicing left handed. After an hour or so I had the gun sited in. The tree is 75 freedom units away. I taped it so I could see if the pellet hit or just took the bark away. 

The second pic is me trying to hit the ribbon, then trying to hit the same hole. Didn't work.  You can see the 2nd small nick. That was from 30 fu's free hand.  The hits on the  post were my next two shots from 100fu's leaning against the outhouse. Trying to hit the stick, then hit the same pellet spot. I can't see the pellets but I was just aiming for what i think is the same spot."
happy,"I'm a minor, just fyi

For the past half of a year I have been in love with my friend. Their kind, and funny, and really sweet, not to mention cute. And I though it was not mutual, I even started telling myself that I just had to get over them, but recently another friend of ours cracked a joke about how they liked me so much, and when said friend left, leaving me alone with them, I asked about it, to which they responded they didn't know. I told them I liked them, and they got so excited, asking me over and over again if I was being for real. They told me so many cute things, like ""you make me feel like I'm so cared about"" and ""you're face- it just makes sense to me."" And we started dating and they tell me how they spend waiting in lines fantasizing about spending time with me. I genuinely didn't know I could be so happy."
happy,"Ill try to be short and sweet, but basically I mentioned to my boyfriend, close friend of two years boyfriend for almost one year, that I'd really love a prom-posal for our senior year since I've never experienced one and it's a once in a lifetime kinda thing for us.

It was a while ago and I assumed her forgot because his schedule with school, sports, gym, etc has him running around. I wasn't even upset and chose to keep it to myself since I know his life is already hectic and didn't want to feel like I was pressuring him.

Well today we were in my room relaxing, I bought some small Lego sets to do, before we started building them he told me if I wanted to see a card trick he just learned.

He dabbles in card tricks and magic, when we first met he did a lot of magic for me, I love watching these tricks to this day. He sat me down next to him and started going on about Royal flush being the best hand in poker while doing the trick for me. I was confused but going along with it and before I knew it he said ""You know what else would be the best, you going to prom with me"" and in front of me the royal flush hand with heart cards with will you go to prom with me on the cards.

I'm heavily emotional and started bawling my eyes like a baby cause he caught me off guard and I didn't know what to say but he reminded me I had to say Yes while hugging me lol.

Regardless, I'm still tearing up over it still cause I can't believe how great of a guy he is and I adore every nerdy, geeky ounce of him.

I just wanted to share this because even though I know it's probably some silly high school romance I still feel like the luckiest person in the world.

Hope you're all having a good day or night and I wish the best for all of you who took time to read this sappy stuff :)"
happy,"Ever since my divorce my life has been soooo much better! I had no idea how much he was dragging me down financially, physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

I’ve paid off all my credit cards and have finally started saving — saving! I’m at my goal weight and I look and feel amazing. I have a gorgeous apartment that I get to decorate however I want; and since my tax return was huge then I actually have the money to do it!

For the first time in my life I only have ONE job, and it’s remote! 

The weather is glorious, my dog is the best ever, I have great friends, my plants are thriving, I love spending time with myself, and I’m even drinking less! 

Thanks for listening Internet strangers, it always feel like too much to brag to friends and family when you’re feeling this good! "
happy,"They’re both just one year old and my first two puppies.  

I’ve been in a totally dark place for the last two months from losing my girl, my bestfriend, but I’m so thankful that my other dog has saved me. Although I’d forever miss and think about my girl, I will look at this birthday as a start of a new life for me and this wonderful boy. That there is hope for me. 

Happy New Year everyone!"
happy,"Poor thing was almost dried up. I put it in my houseplant, watered it, and stuck some dead leaves in the pot. Looking a little more closely at the pictures, I could’ve nursed it a little longer (was worried the pot was too small for it), but I tried my best. I didn’t see it at the time. Nonetheless, I am so glad it’s alive and better!
Wanted to share our little victory with someone🪱"
happy,I remember just a few months ago I couldn't even do 10! Let alone get down and do some more afterwards!
happy,"So, I’m 21 and have gone through a lot of hardship over the last few years. This has made me change my general plan for life a couple of times. But, after switching my major a few times, I decided I want to get a BS in IT. When I’m done with school, I want to move to Las Vegas. I was born in Las Vegas and lived there for the first 10 years of my life. Besides, IT does much better in Vegas than the state I live in. 

I also figured out, after soul searching the last month, that I really am trans (I had a period where I questioned if transitioning was the right choice for me and I figured out it was and I want to continue it!), I don’t want kids, I’m a stoner, and I’d be content being single. However, if someone comes along that’s fine too. I’m very eccentric (very neurodivergent and crazy life), so if I’m gonna find someone romantically, they’re gonna be in a place like Las Vegas. Basically, what I thought I wanted in life is very different then what I “wanted” in life at 19. I put quotations as I used to think, “I should live this way” instead of thinking of what I wanted.  

I fell into a deep depression after a break up around thanksgiving as I questioned what my true purpose in life was. I asked, “In spite of all of my challenges (like my 4 diagnosed mental illnesses which are all severe), why do I choose to continue to live?” Realizing all of this tonight was like answering that question which has been plaguing me for a while now. 

I’m much more happy and content with this plan. I hope I end up happy with it and the ways reality differs from my plan."
happy,"First of all, English isn't my first language so please understand. 

I come from a country and a community where dating culture isn't very big. Me and my brother have a 8 year age gap (he's younger). As a result, we don't relate to the same stuff, share similar likes/dislikes or even talk a lot about our personal lives or choices. Although I find a friend in him and he's been protective, caring; he barely talks about his friends, or problems, etc. 

But today! Oh boy, I'm still smiling ear to ear!
Today he called me out of the blue( lives in a different city) and asked me for an outfit suggestion because he was going to go meet this girl he has had a crush on. That alone, made me so happy! In that moment, I knew he found me helpful, I knew he trusted me with that as probably my parents would not approve of him skipping classes to go meet her, and I was happy that he came to me when he felt like he was stuck.
I gave him a suggestion, appropriate for a first date (of his life) and he left. I was fine, happy that he was happy. It was just a little meet at a cafe at evening, they decided to have some snacks, talk etc and head back their own ways.

Fast forward three hours, HE CALLED me.. n he told me how great the date was!! I NEVER expected he'd call and share that with me! N he was so giggly (I don't know if that's even a word, sorry) and chirpy and happy and nervous and so much more lol! He told me, that she looked so beautiful this evening, that he couldn't utter a word. So he scrolled through Instagram, luckily came across a picture of  beautifully arranged flowers and he sent that post to her with a message that said - ""you look this beautiful today"". My little brother, ladies and gentlemen!! He's 19. 19!!! We never have seen anyone go on a date except in movies and stuff ig. And this guy was like 5yo just a couple years ago 🥺🥺When did he grow up so fast! 

N to top all that, he thanked me - he THANKED ME for helping him know how to treat a girl right! He thinks I'm nice. He trusts me. He ACTUALLY looks up to me!!🥺
I. Am. Melting! 
I'm happy a ton! Sorry if this is too long. To the ones who stuck till the end, you people are my angels. I just wanted to share this. ❤️

happy,"Recovery has been really rough, but I'm so proud of myself for driving and going out today, even just for a few minutes!"
happy,"There wasn't anything special about it really. I just got back from helping my partner move a 9 hour drive away to school. I was driving back feeling very lonely, thinking about a lot of things, life in general. Called various family members and caught up with them. I finally made it home, got settled and took inventory of the food situation. Lots of ancient leftovers in the fridge. I made the ground turkey into taco meat, got the standard fixings together on the tortillas...

My God it was magical. Sometimes you feel like you need a good cry but then you have a good taco and everything is okay and you realize you don't need to cry. The universe put you right where you belong. You are strong. Things are pretty damn good and you get to live a very nice life.

I hope you all have a great night!

happy,"My mom has been a green thumb enthusiasts. Her garden is a beautiful mess with half edibles and flowers and it's a little slice of her happy place.


But she has always been strictly a roses, carnations and dahlias only gardener with the odd daisy, marigold or iris thrown in. Wildflowers to her were the equivalent of weeds (lol).


A few weeks ago, I had been feeling down and I saw a video of a wildflower meadow that looked stunning. I mentioned to my mum about how happy they made me due to the bright colors, the bees and butterflies it attracted. That's it, that's all I said. She nodded and didn't say much. 


Well this morning I saw the tall grassy patch she had left to 'recover and compost' before she planted veg in had wildflowers. 


She seeded the bare patch for me without asking. Just because it made me happy. It made me feel so loved in that moment. Mom cares. She heard and saw what I was feeling and decided to build me a small wildflower patch so I could sit outside and escape my depression.


After years of a rocky relationship, we are finally building a solid foundation with wildflowers."
happy,"I've been really down the last couple of days. Just sad, crying, hopelessness. But the smallest dumbest thing made me burst out laughing. I was giving someone my work email and they kept getting the letters wrong and I had to correct them and something about them typing BBC instead of VVC made me LOL for real. And I'm feeling a lot better. Nothing like a good laugh to remind you that everything will be okay"
happy,"I have a fear of needles, but I wanted to donate blood to save someone's life. A few days ago I finally managed to do so 😁"
happy,"A few weeks ago I won sole custody of my 3 kids from an abusive drug addicted ex. Today she signed the final modification of custody with a notary and everything. Looking forward to moving on and giving my kids the loving home they deserve. It’s taken 3 years, tons of heartbreak and emotions, multiple court appearances and tens of thousands of dollars to get to this point. It’s worth it and you can’t give up! "
happy,"I (M25) remember deploying to the Middle East and staying up until 2-3am in the middle of the desert sleeping on a litter (the medical kind) watching the Matthew Stafford led Lions beat the Matt Ryan led Atlanta Falcons. I was also there when we traded for Jared Goff. My Marines (I was their corpsman “medic”) were from Southern California so I got a lot of grief, but nothing could tear me apart from my home team.

Years later, I remember my girlfriend breaking up with me. I got drunk and sad while I watched the Jared Goff led Lions beat the Matthew Stafford led Rams, winning their first playoff game for the first time in 32 years.

It sounds dumb how much a sports team could effect your mental health. But fuck man, I needed that shit so fuckin badly both times. I often think about the happiness that team gave me when I was at my lowest, shit gets me every time. 

I lived all across the country and had plenty of people just chirp in my ear about how I should just give up being a Lions fan and just join their fan base and I never did. There’s something special about facing adversity or how ____ and ____ isn’t good enough and coming back on the other side better, showing them they were wrong. I think we can all relate to that in some level. You can say it’s dumb, it is a little… but that made me happy and that’s all I need.

Hi, i just got in high school last week and I didn't know anyone except for a friend of mine that ended up on the same school as me. A friend of her  also ended up there (wich i didn't know until yesterday). I just think it's worth to say that my social skills are terrible (expected from a reddit user lol), and i just find so difficult to start conversations, meeting people and stuff like that. On the first week i was dead silent, didn't talk to anyone, i was too shy and embarrassed, and felt like i would be a inconvenience to anyone just trying to stay in peace. Then yesterday (second week already), that friend of mine and her friend were talking to each other and they came to my desk to say something, and just stayed there for the rest of the lunch break, and we talked for a while until the class resumed. But today was even cooler, some of the teachers didn't show up on class, and we just talked the entire time about our lives. And believe it or not, it gets even cooler: we live in the same region, so we get the same buses on our way to home, and guess what: we talked the entire way lol. It just feels so nice to have someone to talk with that isn't on the internet, i was really missing that in-person social interactions haha.
Anyway, i think I've never typed so much in english, I hope only the best for y'all, cya ;P"
happy," Last summer, there was a fat bumblebee hanging around in my neighbor's yard. My mom and I would talk to it whenever we went outside and he/she was there. The bumblebee would buzz towards us in a non-threatening way, back and forth, back and forth, almost dancing in a happy manner. This spring, another bumbly-bee is doing the same actions! This can't be the same bee (unless it's a queen?), but maybe said bumble passed the knowledge of me and mom being friendly.

I'm always happy to see the bumbly-bee when I go outside!"
happy,"Workplace moment

I had a mentally bad morning after my birthday and was having a moment thinking about how certain people in my life would react if I wasn’t in this world (for context this doesn’t happen often and I am ok now).

When I came to work I turned the corner and my colleagues sang happy birthday and had a cake out for me. 

Fair to say my day went from 0-100 after that. It’s the little things that matters, even if you don’t ask if someone’s okay."
happy,"This was filmed at their album release party this past January. I think it rocks and wanted to share. They’re on Spotify and are already ready for a second album this summer. Really happy for him, he’s the guitarist in the cowboy hat and wrote this instrumental!"
happy,"
He is the strongest man I have ever met, I admire and look up to him more than he knows. We passed our one year recently and my love for him still grows day by day. The world seems so colorful with meaning falling out of every single fold and crevice. Everything has meaning. Every little bug exists at the same time as we do. As incoherent as it is, I even find joy in realizing we both have eyes to look at the same things together. We are under the same sky. Somehow these axioms of the human experience feel much more meaningful because he’s alive with me. If I had killed myself when I was 17 I would have never known he was out there in this very world that I am in. Living his little 17 year old life, experiencing things that would make him the man he is today. I sometimes wish we would have met as babies. I would’ve loved him when we were 10, 15, 20, just as much as I love him at 24. I think that’s what love is.

happy," I am so happy. Today I was able to get my own room after having been homeless for a few months. Lost my job and previous home and this last two years have been rough, but definitely back on track now. What a blessing!

approached her, (yes she was a girl im not gonna namedrop) we played roblox day and night enjoying games, we
chatted in the roblox chat feature whenever we weren't playing some chats lasted 3 hours, it was enjoyable until she stopped chatting, everytimee then we could
only communicate every 1 month and so with such
short messages, Thats when she told me she had a
new account, there is when it started we stopped talking completely- Skip to 2022- she told me her new account
and i understood why we couldnt talk much, and then after a few conversations and games, She disappeared completely i was really worried - Skip to 2023-2024-in 2023 i kept chatting her updating new stuff that happened in my life, i missed her completey even if we are just online friends, shes gone.. One last message in 2024 on january

wont repeat again i dont want to lose her, Im going to do everything i can. (I want you guys advice on this, pls tell me your thoughts..)"
happy,"I can't believe I know how to play chess now. I always shunned it because I thought it required way too much thinking for it to be any kind of fun game, but now that I know how the pieces move, I feel like I can do a lot more intellectual things. Really, I learned how to play for two reasons: I quit two of my greatest addictions and really needed something new to occupy my mind. The other reason is because someone once asked me if I knew how to play chess, and it came off as them questioning my intelligence, and I didn't like that at all. So, now I finally know how to play and have so much more I can learn, which is great because I have so much time on my hands.

I'm having a blast! I can't believe I never took the time to learn this very great game. I'm so happy!"

Have a great day everyone, spread the love!"

It's just... ragdoll cats not only are incredibly fluffy and with beautiful eyes but their personality is just so damn awwww :3

This is my second time seeing him in 2024, and we’ll get 2-3 more visits if we’re lucky.

Before I left, I googled concerts in the area, and my favorite band is playing nearby! I found out about the show completely by chance, and I’m so excited!

Currently sitting on his couch, crocheting a blanket for him, and he’ll be home in about 30 minutes (:

happy,💗
happy,"I moved into a small flat when I had my first child, we've lived here for a long time and grown our family and made do with what we had. The area we are in isn't the nicest but we always made the best of it. I started looking for something bigger for us 5 years ago. 
2 years ago we were broken into, (nothing taken, it was a drug addict looking for someone, but refused to believe they didn't live in our house), that same year a new neighbor moved in who vandalised cars on the street, picked fights with passers by, started giving sweets to children in their gardens when the parents weren't looking and he eventually broke into a girl nearbys home. (He didn't harm her just scared her and left)
Last week, I got a call that there is a house available via council housing and I can finally have something more affordable, safer and bigger for my children. When I showed my daughter the keys the first thing she asked was 'is it somewhere safe?' And I can finally say yes. I feel more at peace than I have done in years."

I've been in a really good mood lately. 

I just had a woman hit on me for the first time ever the other day. I was super nervous, but it left me feeling amazing.

And recently I've somehow (through no real effort on my part) managed to become surrounded by very thoughtful, kind, and genuine people.

I've felt more at ease with my life in general.

It almost feels like my world turned around on it's own, and it brought a lot of joy into my life."
happy,I absolutely love pineapple and strawberries! I buy them precut because it’s time consuming but one day I was rambling with my mom complaining about how expensive it is to buy precut fruits so she took it upon herself to buy some pineapples and cut them up and wash the strawberries! ☺️ I’ll finish them in like 2 days lol

I’m a high school teacher, and this morning (after a pretty tough year), I found out that I get to teach my dream class next year!

I don’t have a lot of people to tell, but it was a really good day :) "

My parents don’t love me and haven’t for a long time and I’m happy with that. Recently, my parents have shown their true colors to a lot of people, especially me.

They weaponize my siblings against me, try to financially cripple me, and just try to make me feel as bad as possible.

happy,"The first woman I ever fell in love with was simply a victim of circumstances at the time.  Despite my maturity and the intensity of our bond, we were four years apart during a time that just wouldn't have been fair for us to continue.

A failed marriage and one child each later, she called me out of the blue.  I'm barely 6 months removed from the end of an 8 year marriage.  I thought about calling this woman weeks after it ended, but it wouldn't have been fair.  She and I deserve the time and space to explore our relationship without the cloud of my divorce hanging over it.

Last monday when I was out of town, she called me on a whim.  The universe told her to so loudly that she stopped what she was doing to reach out.  She had no idea of my circumstance (unless she's lying, which is way out of her character).  When her name popped up on my phone, my belly fell straight through my ass and every hair and goosebump on my body sprang to attention.

We've texted and talked every day since.  Like teenagers.  It's amazing.  Each of our kids got sick the day I got back from my business trip.  Twice our plans to reconnect physically have been delayed by the universe.  I am still on cloud 9.  I don't know where it's heading, aside from unbelievable sex. I do know that the connection that her and I have maintained through the years, despite the distance and separation, is unlike anything I've shared with anyone before.  

I'm terrified of how quickly our energy reconnected. Having had a week and two cancelled meetings to build the tension and bond through words and phone calls has been insanely hot.  I haven't been this happy, though, since a year before my marriage ended, at least.  

In the end I just needed to put this into the world.  Of the thousands of emotions I'm dealing with through this, happiness and hope are the two strongest.  I hope that whatever the next days and weeks bring, that I can maintain the feeling of positivity that she's brought into my heart."
happy,"After many failed relationships (they all cheated) I’m finally happy with a guy that is just as happy with me. 

He got me a gift and I can’t stop bawling my eyes out. No one besides family, of course, has ever gotten me a gift before.

I’m so happy!"
happy,"It's been a long journey with a lot of ups and downs, but I've finally found myself a job I can manage with hours that work for me despite my disability - and I thought I was doing ok, but it turns out I've been doing great! I work in health care and it's really important to me that my patients feel cared for and respected, so I'm overjoyed that I've apparently got so much positive feedback from my patients, as well as the other medical staff I work with. I'm not naturally a ""people person"" so it's pretty exhausting putting on my mask for every person who walks through my door, but this makes it feel worthwhile. 

To everyone who worries that they'll never be able to manage in the workplace, don't lose hope! When you're ready, keep searching and the right job could come along when you least expect it. I was struggling so much after years of trying to survive in the workplace that I ended up on a disability pension, deemed unable to work at all. Now I do five mornings a week, which isn't a lot by ""normal people"" standards, but I'm proud that I've made it this far. It's not the job I dreamed of doing and it isn't prestigious or glamorous but it's important work that I'm providing to the community. Everyone has something they can offer to the world, for some of us it just takes longer to find it. "

happy,Me and my wife have been together 20 years in October and married 16 in November. As long as I've known her she's been a smoker. I was a smoker myself. I finally kicked the habit three years ago. Bur my wife has been incredibly stubborn on the subject. Today we talked for a while and she decided to take steps to quit. I couldn't be happier with this decision. I'm aware that this will not he easy but she's at least willing. And I'm gonna stand by her and take all the crap that comes with quitting. If it means she can improve her health and I can have her longer I am more than willing to be her punching bag for a few weeks. I'm very proud because she really didn't want to do this.

happy,"When I finally got up the courage to go to the dentist, I discovered that I needed an old crown replaced, 2 fillings, and, worst of all, 2 root canals. I am terrified of drilling and each time I had to go to an appointment over the past few months, I had to steel myself. However, this entire few years that I have gone without seeing a dentist, I knew that it was just a matter of time before I had a major problem, or even caused myself a serious health problem. It was like I had a shadow of worry always hanging over my shoulder, even in happy moments, and I knew the only way to dismiss it was to finally go to the dentist and let them fix every single problem.  

I had been saving up for a new car, so that money is all gone now, but I don’t need a new car the way I need the blissful peace of mind that comes with finally resolving a serious problem that has followed me for years.  

And actually, it ended up being not the worst case scenario. I didn’t lose a single tooth. I didn’t have to get any implants. If I do better at taking care of my teeth going forward, I hope I can keep all of them. And I hope I don’t ever have to do a root canal again. And my mouth feels so much better.  

edit to add: I just want to describe some things that happened during my first appointment. I was so terrified I was trembling violently. During the part where they were examining my teeth, with various sharp implements, every time it hurt so much, I would flinch violently. Tears began to stream from the corners of my eyes. Until finally the dentist said “Do you need a moment?” and I sat up and the tech fetched my water bottle from my backpack. All of this was in the FIRST appointment, and all they were trying to do was find what was wrong, and what needed to be fixed, and I was so afraid, and my injured teeth hurt SO much. It was, all of it, built upon old childhood trauma, drilling when I wasn’t really numb, an elderly dentist chasing me around the chair and then yelling at my mother not to bring me in again if I was too stupid to let him help me.   

Anyway. I somehow made it through. Perhaps that first appointment _was_ the worst. Worse even than the root canals. "
happy,"I'm an artist in NYC and the last several months have been brutally slow. After a lot of exhausting work, and serious anxiety about what they would say, not 1 but both people who reached out to me said they were going through with their purchases!!! I am soooooo happy and relieved!!! I'll be taking myself out to dinner tomorrow to celebrate 🥳 🎉  The first painting was called ""A Summer Daydream"" and the second was ""Health, Wealth, Prosperity."" Both acrylic on canvas and lots of love! Cheers to a great new year!! ✨️🥰✨️"
happy,"Pretty rainy today but that ain't stopping me! Walked the same distance as yesterday but I'll try another mile in a week or so! I appreciate the support of making this a daily thing and i also appreciate all of you who have ""joined"" me in my walking! Love y'all and I'll see you tomorrow!"
happy,"*Kevin Kelly* is a forward thinker, speaker and author. He founded *Wired* magazine and writes with great insight. Six years ago he turned 68. For each year of his life, he gifted a piece of advice to his children; things he wished he had known at their age. Each year since, on his birthday, he has added to that initial list. Below are ten pieces of advice from *Kevin*’s 74th birthday update, relating to happiness, habits and progress.

# Happiness

1. Where you live (what city, what country) has more impact on your well-being than any other factor. Where you live is one of the few things in your life you can choose and change. In my biased option, *Bath* is a beautiful city. It’s been my home for the last 30 years and brings me great joy.
2. The highest form of wealth is deciding you have enough. My instinct is to believe that if I had more money, I’d be happier. However, those richer and wiser than me have persuaded me otherwise.
3. You’ll never meet a very successful pessimistic person. If you want to be remarkable, get better at being optimistic. I can choose how I interpret the world. I chose to be optimistic with a dose of realism.
4. Asking “what-if?” about your past is a waste of time; asking “what-if?” about your future is tremendously productive. I can’t change the past, but I can influence the future.

# Habits

1. What is important is seldom urgent and what is urgent is seldom important. To get the important stuff done, avoid the demands of the urgent. I try to ensure that activities with longer term benefits are addressed.
2. If you are out of ideas, go for a walk. A good walk empties the mind and then refills it with new stuff. My daily walk gives me space to think and reflect. A life changer for me.
3. You have 5 minutes to act on a new idea before it disappears from your mind. If I have an idea, I note it down in my mobile notes app.

# Progress

1. The best way to criticise something is to make something better. I love building things and seeing others use them.
2. The more persistent you are, the more chances you get to be lucky. I find the concept of increasing one’s *luck surface area* to be an empowering idea. I try to position myself to take advantage of lucky breaks.
3. Decisions like to present themselves as irreversible, like a one-way door. But most deciding points are two-way. Don’t get bogged down by decisions. You can usually back up if needed. Few things in life are permanent. While hard to comprehend, this reality is liberating.

happy,"Hope my cat can brighten your day

My cat always brightens my day every day she brings a smile to my face , every day she brings a smile to my face

I hope this nice picture of her can also brighten your day. She is such a loving cat.

Hope you have all had a great day"
happy,"I've been so depressed the last few months because of an incident I don't want to go into. Its been a long time since I've felt genuine happiness but today is just the perfect day. I feel so relaxed, as if all my problems just went away. There's a really nice sunset out (if only there was a few extra degrees so I could sit out on my balcony), and I'm listening to my favorite tracks on my phone. Usually those things are more of a treatment, but today its a cure. 








I feel free for the first time in so long. I wish this feeling on everyone"
happy,"I know it might be nothing special for you but for me - a person who feels like doesn't make significant progress in English it's quite special. It's more important for me as I didn't attend any special classes to prepare myself for this exam and tbh I didn't prepare at all so it makes me proud of myself that I could pass it relying just on my overall English skills. As a student of applied linguistics that includes studying English in my course, I often feel that I am not even close to the English level of the most of my fellow students and that's true for sure but this exam has shown me that I'm not that bad at English."
happy,"It feels so euphorically good to be in love with my best friend. Have I laughed? Constantly, daily, hourly. Have I cried? Yes, tears of joy. We play video games, sometimes I watch him play, sometimes he watches me, but when we play together we always have each others backs! We go on long walks, at night, with our dog, to the beach, to different cities or exploring shops and attractions. We leave each other love notes, poetry, words of encouragement. We workout and hold each other accountable, cook meals together. We love each other’s families and feel comfortable and accepted. We have spa days together, face masks, bubble bath, scrubs, moisturizer and massages. When either of us feels sad we listen with true understanding and openness, thoughtful advice and write out plans to strengthen our resolve. We dance together, in our home, in the grocery store, with our dog or anywhere we feel like. I’ve never been so in love, at peace, accepted,  empowered and confident. I am finally happy. "
happy,"Not that we are the type of people who stick to a planning but it is showing us that we have something’s that are definitely worth while and got stuff to be excited about! 

Like: we’ll be married for 10 years.

Our kids will each get at least 10 one on one dates  with either parent. 

There will be concerts and date nights 

Birthdays and an unicorn party 

I’m looking forward to a happy 2024"
happy,"Might not seem like a big accomplishment to a lot of people, but as someone who’s been constantly biting their nails until they bleed since like 6 years old (I’m now 16), this is a big accomplishment for me!! 

I used to bite them a lot when I was nervous, after panic attacks or after breakdowns, but for the last two weeks I haven’t had any urges to! My nails are finally long enough that I can paint them and they’re also the longest they’ve been in years! 

They might not be super long but to me they are! I’m hoping to let them grow longer and learn to do more nail art and stuff with them!"
happy,"Is it girl math when you're on your weight loss journey and you're down 2-3 dress sizes so you have to buy new clothes but it's okay cos smaller clothes are cheaper than plus size anyway?

Oh who cares! I'm down almost 3 dress sizes!! I'm doing AMAZING!

THE ONLY WAY IS DOWN!! 🥳"
happy,"Yesterday I received a personal email from a University I applied to that stated how impressed they were with it and how interested they are in my “eclectic interests”. They said they would love to talk to me in person or if I can’t do so via FaceTime! This was a huge confidence boost in my skills as a writer, I’m so happy!"
happy,"Me (16F) and this one guy friend really like to wrestle every once in a while, its super fun and even though he beats me in height, weight, and strength, I’m pretty persistent and am comfortable getting thrown around haha

We had a pretty long talk laying on some grass after an eventful last practice for an extracurricular, as he’s a hs senior leaving in a couple of days. When i brought up how much i appreciated fighting him (it sounds dumb but you know haha), he said he agreed, but no one else really liked to anymore, even his sister. After that, he said something along the lines of “i think I’m kind of like a big brother to you” and that made me really happy because although i wouldnt realistically call him that ive always seen him in a similar light and as a role model

anyone else love wrestling your friends?"
happy,"So I'm 16 and over 300lbs, and yesterday I made a post about me taking my first proper walk in over a year. Y'all made me feel so seen, I felt like I wasn't alone in this journey and I'm appreciative of all of you. I want to make an update everyday to hold myself accountable in a public space. I hope that my posts can inspire just 1 person to start doing the same. Cheers!"
happy,"This morning I was going to work and it was dark but I saw my bf pass me on the highway on our way to work, I instantly got butterflies. Then when I got to the Dunkin drive thru who do I see in front of me….. it’s him. Lol I didn’t think he would notice but then when I got to the window to pay for my coffee the cashier said “here you go. The gentleman in front of you already paid” it’s the little things. y’all I’m so in love 🥰 "
happy,We finally found some second hand ones given away for free! And they're so nice looking too!
happy,"I haven't seen him in 3 years.. but a today was my lucky day! I needed to go at court for personal reasons and was already crying about him,I thought he forgot about me! ( I even thought he died even he texted my auntie!) But as soon I saw him I started to ball my eyes out! It been years since I cried happy tears,but we was able to talk and catch up but then he told me his life was terrible and that this was the best day in years! I'm still crying... because this was my best day in years to! Before me and him needed to go are own ways again,he gave me a card for my birthday with 60 dollars! But at this point I don't care about the cash I just care about the moment.. but that's all now! Have the best day folks!"
happy,Let’s go weekend !!
happy,A small achievement 
happy,"At 9:56 am today my boyfriend (m23) of 4 years and I (f21) both randomly  texted each other ""I love you ❤️"" while we were apart and it just made me smile. I was in my social work course watching a mock therapy group and one of the girls said her partner is her comfort person and I thought of him because he's mine. He told me that ""dreams"" by the cranberries was playing at his work (🥺) and it reminded him of me (omfg I'm winning). Life is funny and this just really reminded me that there are people who love you and think about you even when you're not around. "
happy,"So, basically I had 1€ in my bank account, a d my best friend transfered the remaining 5 to me, because we wanted to play a game together that was on sale. I'm so grateful and happy. I'm definitely going to pay him back though, because I would feel bad if I didn't. Besides, it's the right thing to do. He just deserves the world. Of course, I told him that he didn't have to since it's just a game i could get dor the regular price next month, but he insisted so much, because he knew how much I liked the game from watching him play it during shareplay.

As someone has asked this before in this thread : I'm not comfortable sharing private information with strangers such as sharing my PayPal info."
happy,"Haven't been to a gaming tournament in weeks, because depression hit me hard, to the point I couldn't eat anything sometimes for a couple of days. Pos grad depression hit me hard.

Finally decided I was tired of being a loser, so went to a local gaming tournament and it was amazing.

I talked to some old faces I recognized and even bonded with them even more then usual. I met some new people and I even got some complements on how good I was playing my certain character.

Overall it was so nice to interact with other people even though I was still nervous and self concerned about my appearance and everything, but this experience has convinced me to be more social. I even got invited to play in someone's dorm if I ever wanted to.

I stopped going cause people told me it was lame, and it made me even more depressed and self conscious about it. But I'm glad I'm gonna participate in more."
happy,"I know it’s probably not a crazy good accomplishment; especially because I know I’ve hurt people before, but I’m still proud of myself nonetheless. 

I used to be defensive, snappy, and easy to push into sadness or anger. This was due some previous life experiences. Which doesn’t make it okay. It never does, but I feel like me getting better and being a better friend and person to those around me is a sign that I’m moving on from that. I’m healing. :)

I’ve been in and out of therapy my whole life; which never really worked until I became an adult and was able to truly think for myself and be myself. 
Now; after two years of panic attacks and mental decline, I think I’m finally getting better. I’m kinder, I’m more generous, I’m able to take criticism. I’m still sensitive, but I try to remember the intention of others before reacting in anyway. I’ve also learned to take time for myself incase my emotions get too high. (Something I was INCAPABLE of doing before) 

Okay, sorry for the wall of text; I’m just happy to be doing better. Thank you, if you made it this far. 

Remember to be kind not only to others, but also to yourself. :)"
happy,"I've been sad for nearly 2 years after my best friend completely moved on from me after 13 years. I'm not longer angry or sad about it. 

I can't change it. She's happy now, and that's all I wish for her. I'm at peace with the whole situation at last. I'm happy knowing she's happy, and that we can still be friends, even if we're not as close. 

I think of our memories fondly, and not in sadness. And I feel so much more free, it's always been in the back of my mind since it happened, and when I first thought of her today I just felt alright. Life will do what it will. I absolutely can't wait to make new friends"
happy,"My mom has been a green thumb enthusiasts. Her garden is a beautiful mess with half edibles and flowers and it's a little slice of her happy place.


But she has always been strictly a roses, carnations and dahlias only gardener with the odd daisy, marigold or iris thrown in. Wildflowers to her were the equivalent of weeds (lol).


A few weeks ago, I had been feeling down and I saw a video of a wildflower meadow that looked stunning. I mentioned to my mum about how happy they made me due to the bright colors, the bees and butterflies it attracted. That's it, that's all I said. She nodded and didn't say much. 


Well this morning I saw the tall grassy patch she had left to 'recover and compost' before she planted veg in had wildflowers. 


She seeded the bare patch for me without asking. Just because it made me happy. It made me feel so loved in that moment. Mom cares. She heard and saw what I was feeling and decided to build me a small wildflower patch so I could sit outside and escape my depression.


After years of a rocky relationship, we are finally building a solid foundation with wildflowers."
happy,This is my girlfriend of 7 years and both of our kids 5 year old girl and 3 year old boy. We both worked a long day but wanted to treat our kids to some fun at the park before the sun went down and go to Dairy Queen to end the night! We have been through some hard times but no matter what the light always will shine the next day and I have to keep my light shining!!!
happy,"So I’ve been wanting to be more like my awesome marathon runner Papa. He’s always been a wonderful athlete! Running marathons when he was younger to playing softball now, in his 80’s. He’s the coolest guy, I’m dying to be more like him. Not just physically but emotionally too. He’s always been so chill. 

I set a goal to try to walk five miles every other day just to start, and to my surprise I’ve actually gone and done it! Pokémon GO tracks the duration of my walks and I’ve walked more than thirty miles each week for the past three weeks. I’m over the moon! 🐮 Just wanted to share some happy news. I hope you all have a nice day today!  

"
happy,"I've been really down the last couple of days. Just sad, crying, hopelessness. But the smallest dumbest thing made me burst out laughing. I was giving someone my work email and they kept getting the letters wrong and I had to correct them and something about them typing BBC instead of VVC made me LOL for real. And I'm feeling a lot better. Nothing like a good laugh to remind you that everything will be okay"
happy,She marked her 3rd year sober Friday.
happy,"I’ve been overweight for my entire life, and finally started trying to lose weight in a sustainable way back in December. As of this morning, I have lost 15 pounds! 

I have had trichotillomania (compulsive hair pulling, related to OCD and anxiety) for fifteen years. As of this morning, I have gone THREE DAYS without pulling! 

I’m a high school teacher, and this morning (after a pretty tough year), I found out that I get to teach my dream class next year!

I don’t have a lot of people to tell, but it was a really good day :) "
happy,"This morning I was going to work and it was dark but I saw my bf pass me on the highway on our way to work, I instantly got butterflies. Then when I got to the Dunkin drive thru who do I see in front of me….. it’s him. Lol I didn’t think he would notice but then when I got to the window to pay for my coffee the cashier said “here you go. The gentleman in front of you already paid” it’s the little things. y’all I’m so in love 🥰 "
happy,"In the first picture 140lbs, Second picture 216lbs. 6’4 btw."
happy,"She told me near the end of January of this year that she is gay. Since then she's been a lot more sociable and is flashing that gorgeous, radiant smile of hers a lot more often. She called me this morning (her mom has custody on weekends) and told me all about this girl and their date, and it's the happiest I've ever heard her sound.

I am so unbelievably proud of my little girl. I'm smiling ear to ear thinking about how happy she must be to be living as her true self. She is my world, and her happiness is my happiness."
happy,"Life update: you may remember me from this post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/b5p72v/comment/ejhehp6/](https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/b5p72v/comment/ejhehp6/)

But so many things have happened since then. You guys truly changed my life at that moment and I wouldn't have even gotten started without you guys. I've been picked up by a small but pretty successful publisher, DYB Publishing, for both my seven book fantasy series and science fiction trilogy.  I also went to my first anime convention last week and almost sold out (despite me almost dying from social anxiety). And I just wanted to come by and thank all of you! Also here are some pictures!

happy,"If any of yall remember, a few weeks ago i had discovered a nest of blue eggs in my easter themed wreath. Since then we have caution taped the door and all four eggs have hatched!!! They seem to be House finch eggs as some of you correctly predicted!!! Happy late easter everyone and have an awesome week!!!"
happy,"Happy New Year, this is the best picture of fireworks that I ever took and sorry that the picture looks a bit foggy I took the picture from inside my house"
happy,"this morning, my boyfriend had to get up before i did. our room was kinda cold so he put his blanket on top of me so i had two blankets and i was soooo warm and comfy :’) (we sleep with separate blankets because we both tend to pull it away from each other in our sleep when we share one lol)

he knows i was really anxious about going to work today so he got me a cup of coffee and brought it to me at work before he headed to work himself. i feel so happy i could cry. he takes such good care of me and i really couldn’t ask for anyone better. he’s my whole world :)"
happy,I am in 9th grade and I was just going through so kinda rough times my ex was spreading rumors and her friend (a boy) wanted to jump me with a group of friends and it finally stopped. I had a track meet today and I couldn't run in the meet because I got injured in gym class (sprained knee). So I was taking times for all the running events and this one girl (senior) did a really good job on hurdles. When I got in the car the first thing I did was add her on snap to give her congrats on doing so well and it turned into us getting to know each other and then I asked her if being an adult is hard and she told me it wasent and reassured me it's actually fun because you can drive and get more jobs. We ended up talking about our plans for out of high school. This girl helped my fears of adulthood and actually made me exited for it.
happy,"I'm so happy seeing her cuddled up in her old bunk bed this morning, we did something right huh? She still wants to be around us lol. "
happy,"Update

I was going through a bad state well was about to but I got through it because of one special girl that I have been with for 3 months yes we are long distance but I got to see her for 2 days and that was the happiest I have been since my popow I feel amzing right now I really love her thank you for all the kind comments last time 😁"
happy,"I wanted to share this online to give some hope. We can do this. Love you all, take care ok? ❤️"
happy,"So basically I (20 M) have lost a shit ton of weight from say weighing 120 kilograms to right now weighing 83 kgs. I regularly go to the gym and I have them muscles too. There's just one teeny tiny issue. I was a hell of a glutton when I was chubby, and that habit still persists in the form of my sweet tooth and binge eating, though not often. 
Today, particularly, I'd eaten more than I'm supposed to, on my calorie deficit, by say 200-300 kcals, and all the PTSD came rushing to my head. I know it's not healthy, but this does not happen often. Okay so, my girlfriend rudely cut my video call cause her friend called and the girls had a nice time putting on face masks and stuff (when my girl (19 F) had told me before that she would do that with me on video call, while we talk.) So obviously this made me feel bad, and along with the PTSD, made my emotions avalanche down the fkin mountain. 
Cue me calling my girl a bit later, she goes ""tell me what's the matter"" in the most bored voice ever. I couldn't stop myself, tears started flowing down my eyes. I didn't know how to tell her what the matter was, and that made my emotions plummet even more.
However, after a while, I gathered composure, told my girlfriend the reasons, that I missed my father, and my grandmothers every single day, think about the days they were alive, and that I get motivation from them, to succeed. I told her about the PTSD regarding my body image issues, and what I consider as freedom from this: I want to be able to rip of my shirt and wear shorts without worrying about my physique whatsoever. (Not to mention I want that athletic physique and am working towards it). 
Where I knew that I'd won, with her as my girlfriend, is when she listened through everything, then at the end, told me stuff I exactly wanted to hear. That how she'd shown a pump picture of mine to one of her guy friends and how the guy praised my physique, how she'd storied a picture of me with a beautiful Persian cat (she was absolutely wonderful, the cat) on instagram, and how her friend replied ""Where were such beautiful and wonderful guys when I was searching for them? What kinda black magic did you perform that suddenly you get such a great guy to be your boyfriend?"". I feel absolutely elated right now.
There was this day I wore a semi-transparent shirt out, and my girl said today: listen babe, yk, I know we went to a temple that day but I could not help thinking unholy shit to do to you.
I am so fucking happy right now. i hope I marry this girl someday."
happy,"So I've worked for getting on 6 years now 

Been senior support for about 3-4 years. Which involves working 24 hour shifts 

For the last year or so I've been doing a lot of the manager work without the extra pay, this is because the current deputy was not really able to do the tasks 

Well I was having a bit of a moan over the Easter bank holidays because I had finished three 24 hour shifts when the regional manager started sending me a series of tasks for some reason (my bosses boss) and I did it all promptly while moaning at myself for being a push over 

Turns out the regional manager then asked my boss why I'm not the deputy as I seem better for the role.

This lead to a discussion with the current deputy who said that she is more than happy to step down from the position for me to take over 


So I'm happy to have gotten recognition from someone high up the chain but also I will now only be working one 24 hour shift a week and will have 16 hours office hours throughout the week 

Also I still get a pay rise of course aha "
happy,"It's been a long time coming. I haven't been able get more than a buzz for about four years now on account of how high my tolerance is. My lungs have begun to protest as well. I've had it in my mind for a while now that I need to take a lengthy tolerance break. Whenever my weed is about to run out I tell myself that this is it and that once it's gone I would begin a several month long break.

What always happens is I will smoke my last bowl and then find myself walking over to the dispensary that's literally a two minute walk away and buying another ounce. Last night I finished smoking my supply and I didn't buy more. I didn't buy any today either. The dispensary closes in 13 minutes and that will make it official.

For the first time in probably five years, I chose not to smoke weed. Tiny milestone, but tomorrow I will abstain again, and the next day, and the next, and the next."
happy,Happy family. 🙂
happy,"Throughout my life I have dealt with a series of health problems and that caused me to be very lethargic. Been to hospital and so on many times. Mainly stuff with my ovaries, kidneys, and liver.  

One thing that made me upset a bit was when I was 17 and attempted to donate blood, but was just not able to due to my condition and problems in general.

Today after dealing with going to the doctors pretty much once a month last year I was finally eligible to donate and so I signed up and did so. 

Happened only a few hours ago and I feel great! Before when I used to get blood drawn for example for medical reasons I would get very nauseous and faint just due to how my health was. Feels strange not feeling that way despite the donation being more blood."
happy,"I have sensory issues and I can't drive because I have epilepsy, so I was looking for a work from home job and I found a job for data entry. It's pretty easy so far according to the training assessments I was given and I start tomorrow. I'm so excited! It's been a few years since I've had a job. I have a 2mo old my husband makes good money but I am beyond excited! This is honestly such a blessing"
happy,"I've struggled in the dating arena for years, only managing to get one or two first dates, from the apps. Last year, I realized I was asexual, and tried a dating site for asexuals. I started chatting with someone on there, and just met in person, and we really hit it off. "
happy,"I didn’t think I made enough money but I submitted my documents and they said I make way more than the qualifying amount. This is my first big adult real-life payment, and I’m so excited to move in. It’s an awesome place. "
happy,"[unrelated image]
Hi, i just got in high school last week and I didn't know anyone except for a friend of mine that ended up on the same school as me. A friend of her  also ended up there (wich i didn't know until yesterday). I just think it's worth to say that my social skills are terrible (expected from a reddit user lol), and i just find so difficult to start conversations, meeting people and stuff like that. On the first week i was dead silent, didn't talk to anyone, i was too shy and embarrassed, and felt like i would be a inconvenience to anyone just trying to stay in peace. Then yesterday (second week already), that friend of mine and her friend were talking to each other and they came to my desk to say something, and just stayed there for the rest of the lunch break, and we talked for a while until the class resumed. But today was even cooler, some of the teachers didn't show up on class, and we just talked the entire time about our lives. And believe it or not, it gets even cooler: we live in the same region, so we get the same buses on our way to home, and guess what: we talked the entire way lol. It just feels so nice to have someone to talk with that isn't on the internet, i was really missing that in-person social interactions haha.
Anyway, i think I've never typed so much in english, I hope only the best for y'all, cya ;P"
happy,"It's been impossible for me (66F) to find anybody locally who knows enough about this to treat me, and the Mayo Clinic turned me down as a patient because I don't have the worse, more dangerous level of the disease, just the basic really shitty form of it.

I recently found out about Ketamine being used to treat chronic pain✅ trauma✅ depression✅ anxiety✅ *and this mast cell disease*✅, and five days ago I started on a daily microdose protocol. (The Ketamine works on the trauma *and* makes mast cells **calm TF down**, which helps the depression, anxiety, and pain, which will help calm down my nervous system, which will improve the mast cell symptoms, which include all of the above except the trauma.)

I didn't know what to expect because the disease makes my body think I'm allergic to virtually everything, but I haven't reacted noticeably to the drug at all. I haven't been optimistic at all about my future since my diagnosis, I'm so excited!"
happy,"I recently met someone. Our first date was during the work week, we met for drinks and ended up talking for 6 hours! Our second date was yesterday. It was so nice. We had ice cream and  went to the museum. He’s smart and funny. Artistic and creative. We had great conversation and he was a complete gentleman. He texted today and asked to go on a proper dinner date. 
I’m looking forward to seeing where this could go. ☺️ "
happy,"Howdy y'all,

A little background: so I'm autistic with a few special interests, e.g. history, aviation, and hot dogs (that one's not important, but still hot dogs are awesome, fight me lol)

Today is not my birthday, but as I'm in the middle of a grueling job search, my friends thought it important to take me out early to both cheer me up and ensure I had a day off.

That is what I assumed, at least!

Turns out these absolute a-holes tricked me and treated me to a lovely day around the city enjoying my favorite things. We went and had a fabulous breakfast before jumping ship to an aviation museum, then enjoying a day by the beach in a more touristy spot of my city before finally going to an art museum styled after a Roman Villa (the Getty Villa in Los Angeles, I highly recommend if you're ever out this way)

Now, I had a blast, but as it turns out, they had one more surprise for me.

A plane ticket to Rome with complete reservations for accommodations!

I'm having a panic attack. I don't know how to respond. I don't know how to pay them back. I'm so incredibly lucky! What could I have possibly done to deserve any of this?!"
happy,This works good if I'm sad about stuff that isn't a huge deal which is a lot of the time haha
happy,"Haven't been to a gaming tournament in weeks, because depression hit me hard, to the point I couldn't eat anything sometimes for a couple of days. Pos grad depression hit me hard.

Finally decided I was tired of being a loser, so went to a local gaming tournament and it was amazing.

I talked to some old faces I recognized and even bonded with them even more then usual. I met some new people and I even got some complements on how good I was playing my certain character.

Overall it was so nice to interact with other people even though I was still nervous and self concerned about my appearance and everything, but this experience has convinced me to be more social. I even got invited to play in someone's dorm if I ever wanted to.

I stopped going cause people told me it was lame, and it made me even more depressed and self conscious about it. But I'm glad I'm gonna participate in more."
happy,"So it's been a while... I don't have my own kids to be proud of or excited for on their first day of school but I can be proud of and excited for myself. I have been in school for well over a year, which was a huge transition for me from who I was to begin with. But, today is my first day of classes in person... Over 20 years since I last sat in a classroom. I am excited for this. This is another step towards who I want to be. Here's to the future, and the work we put in to make one."
happy,"I paid off my house today and I am 100% debt free!

For context on this, my finances got really messed up by a combination of the great recession and my husband passing away in 2007-2008.I started with almost nothing except for my kids and my job skills. I slowly rebuilt my life and finances step-by-step.

I had a low interest rate, but I wanted to pay off my home loan since retirement is not too far away. I have a few more years to top off my savings then I can pull the plug on my career.

I set a goal for myself to pay off my house and this morning I called the bank and did it. So happy that this long stretch of frugality finally paid off!"

happy,"Been talking to this girl for a actually not that long just two or thre months, has not been the best start but currently it's been working really well actually. got to hang out and yeah she's starting to text me on her own whenever we didn't text much throughout the day, asking me how my day has been. Seems stupid but it really means alot to me because i have had a really  exhausting  time with relationships and had little to no female friends and never talking to anyone or socializing for days and feeling left alone and it's been a while since my last relationship that was more than just sleeping together. I mean intimicay doesn't do much for me if i don't feel emotionally connected. Nothing made me happier recently than when she texts me and asks how my day was or when we just talk about Mutual interests and shit. Life has been really good recently."
happy,"Quit my job

Recently quit my full time job. Was a good position and good pay but my manager went behind my back and basically just gave my position away and expected me to take the demotion purely because she was struggling at the other location and needed me back there to help. It was nothing to do with me or my work as I was really good at my job (don't mean to be bigheaded) but she allowed this other lady to introduce herself to all my colleagues as the manager of my location when they all know that i was there. 
I was really upset because it made it look like it was because I couldn't do my job and she completely broke any trust I had for her. I loved my job and I'm pretty upset BUT I stood up for myself and didn't stand for the lack of respect and told her where to go. I'm proud of myself for doing so and happy I'm no longer working under her. I'm confident I'll get a good job again that gives me the respect and decency I'm owed.

Just needed a lil rant lol don't mind me"

happy,"I’m going with 2 of my close girl friends. I’ve done cruises with family before but I’ve never traveled as an adult, both in the US and internationally,  without family (parents) or husband. Now I’m 31, divorced, just got out of an awful relationship, and i am SO excited for these next adventures. I’m going to see some BEAUTIFUL places, learn fascinating history, drink, laugh, meet new people, and I can hardly wait. 

I’ve been through a pretty wild ride the last several years and I just feel like I am in a really good place. I have good friends, good family, a job I love that pays the bills, and I am able to do things like get a Disneyland pass and travel to new places. I am so happy and grateful to be where I am in life and I hope everyone finds this level of contentment ❤️"

happy,"I work by myself in animal rescue in a place where abandoned animals is pretty common. After my money goes into them and my own groceries, I often have next to nothing to spend on myself. For the last year and a half, I was sleeping on an old donated sofa bed in the main room. But my birthday was last month, and some friends chipped in to buy me the mattress, bed frame, and even new pillows and bedsheets! I did end up building it myself, which took the whole month because I had to find time between running around doing animal stuff, so it feels like my accomplishment too. I just feel so proud of myself and so happy and lucky to have great friends.

happy,"This admittedly isn't a giant achievement, but it made me happy. Ever since I was a little kid, I've wanted to have Minecraft on the computer, I idolized a lot of MC youtubers back then ( such as Amylee33, StacyPlays, GamingwithJen, dantdm and stampylongnose) and wanted to do what they did. And now I finally have it on my own pc! I luckily managed to save enough for my mom to let me get a card to buy it with. I plan to make a bunch of builds soon!"
happy,"Hello everyone! If you look on my profile I’ve posted once a year about my weight loss. I started originally at 320 (although I was too embarrassed to admit it) and got to I think 250 before I got hurt, gained more weight, lost some. Now for 2023. Over the end of 2022 and into 2023 I let a coworker treat me to lunch every day. Where I ate a ton and really fell back into my old terrible habits and all that.
Since September something in me changed. (Also me and that coworker stopped talking, they were a terrible influence but I’m not go into that here) I have cut out most sugars and in general crappy food out. I usually eat one good meal a day. 
I originally started this just to lose weight out of embarrassment of how bad I had let myself go. Now, I just want to feel better. I’ve seen how much my diet change has improved how I feel and the lost weight helps a ton too. I feel so much better about myself. I just want to change now for the betterment of my health, now for how I look.
So here’s my post this year to keep myself accountable (and also people have said they wanted to see my updates as the years go on)
My end goal right now for this year is to be near 220, but I’d REALLY like to be under 200. So let’s see how 2024 will treat me and you and I hope we can accomplish our goals. If you made it this far reading, I thank you! See you next year!"

happy,"Hey All - Just wanted to tell someone other than since I don’t really have any friends. 

Got the promotion at work I’ve been working towards for the last 11 months. Over 125 interviews (internal postings) and I got selected. Beat out very capable individuals, some with 5-7 years of seniority. 

Pretty damn happy. Giving my all each and every day, without exception, finally paid off for me, for once.

This is my second time seeing him in 2024, and we’ll get 2-3 more visits if we’re lucky.

Before I left, I googled concerts in the area, and my favorite band is playing nearby! I found out about the show completely by chance, and I’m so excited!

Currently sitting on his couch, crocheting a blanket for him, and he’ll be home in about 30 minutes (:

So grateful I get to see my favorite band live with my favorite person!!! Happy Thursday everyone"

I understand that PT school isn't the best financial decision for most people, but I did accept my offer at a relatively cheap school. Beyond that, I grew up with a single mom and my first paycheck will be more than she has ever made! It just feels like all the work is paying off and I am making progress towards my goals."
happy,"Lately I've been into collage thanks to the algorithm making me watch videos of scrapbooking and journaling. I've never been good with handmade stuff and I'm very conscious of it because I've never been ""excellent"" with that type of stuff. But that videos are really nice to watch and I keep thinking I want to do it too.

As soon as I told my husband that I wanted to try it he lent me his account for buying the materials even though we're on a tight budget (I had surgery recently because of a broken bone in my left hand). He never said ""You can't do it"", ""You aren't good with those things"", ""You only do it because of the videos"" or other stupid things I thought when I decided to tell him I wanted to try it. He even said it was nice because I could do it as rehab for my hand... It's been a week since then and he's following our orders and even helping me do my first collages because there's some things I still can't do with my hand.

I was afraid that as I finished my first one he would notice I'm terrible at it and maybe he would be mad for spending that money but quite the contrary he said it looked good and encouraged me to keep going.

He's not only aknowledging my desire to try a new hobby as valid but also he's giving me courage to challenge myself in things I always felt unsuited for.

 I'm really thankful for him..."
happy,"I'm 32, been struggling with depression and anxiety since I was about 13 or 14. Due to reasons, I never tried medication for either, before (even when I definitely should have). Basically, I was conditioned to think that my illnesses were not real and medication was just not an option. 

About a year and a half ago, I started meds for my depression, and they certainly help, but I've still been struggling with overwhelming, constant anxiety that has been truly ruining my life. I *finally* talked to my doctor about it, and she prescribed an additional medication. Within only 5 days, I have noticed a HUGE, incredible improvement. I feel like me, again. I can breathe again (literally, I've have constricted breathing for like a year). 

I want to cry, I'm so relieved and happy to feel like I have my life back, again. I wish I had done this years ago, but I've got it now and that's all that matters!"

So many happy and funny moments and it's just warm feeling to watch people embark on new incredible journeys, even when so much else feels like it's ending.

I love sharing joys and wins with people, and being able to do that with people I'll never meet is really filling a hole in my soul right now."
happy,"A close encounter of the saintly kind…

…At the grocery store with my daughter. She’s little, so tends to have the “Please, buy me everything!” anytime we’re in the store. Most of the time she’s fine with a “Not today, sweetie.” but today, she was in her feels because ALLLLLLLL of the day-after Valentine’s Day items were smack dab in front of the door when we walked in. She wanted a balloon. Mommy said “Not today, sweetie.” and today, that “not today” didn’t go over very well. She proceeded to be very pouty. Meh, it happens. 

Well, we’re in an aisle looking for artichoke hearts and there stood a kindly, bespectacled, affable looking gentleman. I asked his pardon as we passed. We started making small talk after he tried to engage my daughter and she made it very clear that she wanted a balloon and wasn’t allowed to have one. He laughed and looked at me chuckling. “It doesn’t get easier as they get older!” to which I replied “She’s six… pray for me!” 

The kindly gentleman (before we learned his name) knelt down and said to my daughter “You know… balloons are wonderful, but they are often the best when they’re surprises, so maybe you can look forward to getting one when you least expect it.” This seemed to go over well with my daughter. 

The kindly gentleman (Mr. Myles, I came to know) and I continued chatting about kids, life, and random musings, eventually parting with a genuine sense of happiness over the entire interaction. He proceeded to the front of the store and my daughter and I continued our shopping. 

A few moments later, he found us at the back of the store with a heart shaped balloon. With the biggest smile ever, he handed it to my daughter and said “See? Isn’t it so much better when it’s a surprise?” I was dumbfounded, more tickled pink than I’d been in a while and said “You’re an absolute angel! No wait- a Saint! Thank you Saint Myles!” 

Random acts of kindness are the best. In a world full of curmudgeonly behavior- be like Myles."
happy,"Ill try to be short and sweet, but basically I mentioned to my boyfriend, close friend of two years boyfriend for almost one year, that I'd really love a prom-posal for our senior year since I've never experienced one and it's a once in a lifetime kinda thing for us.

It was a while ago and I assumed her forgot because his schedule with school, sports, gym, etc has him running around. I wasn't even upset and chose to keep it to myself since I know his life is already hectic and didn't want to feel like I was pressuring him.

Well today we were in my room relaxing, I bought some small Lego sets to do, before we started building them he told me if I wanted to see a card trick he just learned.

He dabbles in card tricks and magic, when we first met he did a lot of magic for me, I love watching these tricks to this day. He sat me down next to him and started going on about Royal flush being the best hand in poker while doing the trick for me. I was confused but going along with it and before I knew it he said ""You know what else would be the best, you going to prom with me"" and in front of me the royal flush hand with heart cards with will you go to prom with me on the cards.

I'm heavily emotional and started bawling my eyes like a baby cause he caught me off guard and I didn't know what to say but he reminded me I had to say Yes while hugging me lol.

Regardless, I'm still tearing up over it still cause I can't believe how great of a guy he is and I adore every nerdy, geeky ounce of him.

I just wanted to share this because even though I know it's probably some silly high school romance I still feel like the luckiest person in the world.

Hope you're all having a good day or night and I wish the best for all of you who took time to read this sappy stuff :)"

happy,"Hi guys, 

So I’ve been doing some meditations that have really been working for me lately and I have a few things in my life that are going well and am in a couple blessed situations. I’m starting to have moment of real happiness on levels I don’t know if I’ve had before. I think mostly due to the meditations because it’s not externally dependent. 

I still have daily struggles and things I’m working on. A lot more than people know. Even the fact that I’m working on my struggles and am seeing them getting better is making me happy. I’ve had a lot of suffering in my life, especially within myself about myself and to witness imrovement is like witnessing a wonder, a miracle. 

I keep running into the situation where I tell people about the good things in my life, in a super excited way, (it could even be a new positive way I’m perceiving the world), and I feel (or at least perceive (I could be projecting)) it making people uncomfortable or I feel that I am being too much. I notice within me a fear of being unrelatable expressing the goodness in my life. I’m afraid of making people jealous. I feel like I need to then tone down the positive thing I said with something more “down to earth” (though I don’t because I see that urge rising from an anxiety about how others perceive me and to not try to “fix” it) 

I feel like I need to be more tactful than I am and I’m curious if anyone has any advice? One thing I’m trying not to do is tone myself down for others comfort (I’ve often done this when going out to not make other girls jealous) but also I don’t want to come off as chaotic or make people feel bad. 

On some level writing this does make me feel like it’s okay to be unapologetically happy/well. Maybe that’s how relaxed people are and I’m just learning/relearning it. 

Grateful for your input.
Thank you . "
happy,"Recently Ive opened myself up expanded my horizons and gotten with some really cool people, microbiologists, actresses from london, screenwriters from new york, Bob Ross trained painters, wave scientists, hang gliding instructors.

 Who would have thought that there were so many opportunities, experiences, and pretty faces out there.


“My troubles will be few”"
happy,"Cigarette Daydreams

If there is one song that encapsulates my childhood and young adult years, it's ""Cigarette Daydreams"" from Cage the Elephant.  Cage is that band that popped into my life in High school and just stuck with me ever since.  And I'm so grateful for them because they've never really strayed too far from their roots, but definitely changed their sound (for the better), but not their style!

Anyways!

I know that many would say this song hits them for the same reason, and most likely, rightfully so!!!  It's so good and is able to gather and glue our precious memories and feelings together!

I remember when it first came out, I was in a place and time of my life where huge changes were taking place, and I didn't even realize it.
I had moved (not too far) from my home town, and had made a new life and new friends.......but still kept my OG homies close and visited them often. 
At the time, the song had resonated pretty hard with me.  But now when I hear it, it makes me tear up.

There are a lot of songs and music that ""takes me back"" to certain times.  Like a certain scent or image does.  
It takes you back to your childhood or to a place where life felt so meaningful at that moment.

But this song hits so hard that it's hard to listen to it sometimes because it makes me feel like I'm back hitting up random parties with old friends (new and old at the time), hot boxing my car, going on road trips, and just BSing around campfires.

It's such a bittersweet song to me.

Its like this:
It takes me back to only a few years ago, and YEARS beyond those years and makes me feel like I'm back there.....and even today with where I'm at and the friends that I have, it resonates so much because of the memories I'm making now!

he knows i was really anxious about going to work today so he got me a cup of coffee and brought it to me at work before he headed to work himself. i feel so happy i could cry. he takes such good care of me and i really couldn’t ask for anyone better. he’s my whole world :)"
happy,"Hi, Everyone.

I was going to wait a week, but I had to create an account and post this because I’m just too happy to keep it inside anymore.

A few days ago, my wife posted on this board. She was having a tough time sleeping, and in the middle of this rough night, the thought of something I did brought a smile to her face. She shared that moment with everyone here, and in response, the amount of goodwill and kindness that flowed from this community was overwhelming. 

She kept this post secret from me—never expecting it to make other than a few people smile. Little did she know, it would gain a ton of traction. The generosity and support that followed made it tough for her to conceal, and eventually, she showed me the thought that made her so happy this past Monday at 3 A.M..

My wife is amazing. I’m so happy, lucky, and fortunate to be in that group of people who have truly found their soulmate. My heart becomes full just thinking about her, and sometimes I just say her name randomly because it makes me happy to hear. I love her so much, and I can’t stop smiling right now.

I also want to take a moment to thank everyone in this community. What you all did truly shows the amazing types of people you are. From the messages of encouragement, to the acts of support, it’s a been such a joy. I’ll never forget any of it, and when I called my mother to tell her about what everyone here did, it seriously made her day.

Thank you all so much. You made my wife happy. You made my mom happy. For that, I will forever be grateful, and I promise to do my best to spread all the positive energy you gave us back out into the world.

happy,"Just needed to get off my chest how happy I’m feeling rn in my relationship. We’re definitely not perfect but my fiancé tries really hard to make me happy and really listens and takes on board anything I have to say. It helps that he’s a complete lefty and the biggest feminist I know, we share all the same values and have the same morals. We’ve been together 3 and a half years now, I have a child with my ex husband and a child with my fiancé. He treats both kids and loves both kids the same, he’s a brilliant dad and I feel so lucky. 

My heart feels happy ♥️"

And the weight of his arm around her shoulders."
happy,"We had our ups and downs throughout the year, but we secured our place in the roll-off for the League Championship. Started off strong and finished strong beating last year’s chanpions. "
happy,"So today was garbage collection day in my neighborhood and my usual routine is walk out to my backyard, unlock the gate to my backyard, walk out to my front yard and collect the trash can, roll back the trash can back to the gate of my backyard, open the gate to my backyard, roll the trash can through the gate into my backyard, close the gate, but today life had other plans for me. To preface this, the lock on the gate to my backyard is an old fashioned hook where you close the gate and push the hook through it.

I observed the garbage truck collecting my trash at around 01:15 PM today and decided to just collect the trash can now so I don't have to do it later at night. There was heavy gusts of wind and a violent rainpour but I just decided to push through it. I opened the door to my backyard and sprinted through my backyard like an olympian while enjoying the feeling of the wind blowing against my hair and the free shower from the water droplets. I unlocked my backyard gate and sprinted across my front yard to get the trash can and begin rolling the trash can across my front yard to finally get this mundane task over with. I approached the gate to my backyard ready to open it and finish this chore once and for all.

That's when life threw a wrench in my plans. I pushed against the gate to my backyard. It didn't bulge. I pushed again. It didn't bulge. That's when I realized that as I was rolling the trash can across my front yard to the gate of my backyard, the violent gusts of wind of the ongoing storm had blown the gate to my backyard shut and the hook lock to cover it as well. The front door was locked. I had no other way into my house other than the door to my backyard, but that was closed off due the gate being locked. Mind you, I didn't even have my phone, so I couldn't call for help if anything else went awry. That's when a lightbulb shined brightly over my head.

I pushed the trash can in front of the gate to my backyard. I climbed on top of my trash can, it took me 2 tries. Once on top, I looked down and just braced myself for the inevitable, the call of the void. I jumped over the fence and dropped down. It was a 5 foot drop. My legs didn't break fortunately. I unlocked the gate to my backyard and rolled in my trash can. The mundane task was done. I hope none of my neighbors saw me jumping over my own fence and call the cops on me. It looks truly suspicious from an outsider's perspective. Maybe next time I'll put a brick or something in the doorway so it doesn't shut out on me completely. This entire ordeal lasted 8 minutes, and it was the longest 8 minutes of my life.

At least I got my cardio in today. I can't wait to do this chore again in a week and see what happens. I'm coming to an action movie near you. Until then, have a nice day! This is JNORJT, signing off."
happy,"I’m a 20 year old in my last year of college and for a long time I was so confused as to what I wanted to do with my communications degree. I did a few internships which I hated and had no idea how I was going to cope working in a place I hate for the next 50 years. 

Now, by a chance opportunity, I started a new job alongside my studies for a company in an industry that I love to death (it’s a type of sports). 

I love the people I work with, my office is super nice, and the work is really interesting and fulfilling. I’m actually genuinely excited to grow and learn and forge my career and I am so grateful for the opportunity! 

"
happy,"First of all, English isn't my first language so please understand. 

I come from a country and a community where dating culture isn't very big. Me and my brother have a 8 year age gap (he's younger). As a result, we don't relate to the same stuff, share similar likes/dislikes or even talk a lot about our personal lives or choices. Although I find a friend in him and he's been protective, caring; he barely talks about his friends, or problems, etc. 

But today! Oh boy, I'm still smiling ear to ear!
Today he called me out of the blue( lives in a different city) and asked me for an outfit suggestion because he was going to go meet this girl he has had a crush on. That alone, made me so happy! In that moment, I knew he found me helpful, I knew he trusted me with that as probably my parents would not approve of him skipping classes to go meet her, and I was happy that he came to me when he felt like he was stuck.
I gave him a suggestion, appropriate for a first date (of his life) and he left. I was fine, happy that he was happy. It was just a little meet at a cafe at evening, they decided to have some snacks, talk etc and head back their own ways.

Fast forward three hours, HE CALLED me.. n he told me how great the date was!! I NEVER expected he'd call and share that with me! N he was so giggly (I don't know if that's even a word, sorry) and chirpy and happy and nervous and so much more lol! He told me, that she looked so beautiful this evening, that he couldn't utter a word. So he scrolled through Instagram, luckily came across a picture of  beautifully arranged flowers and he sent that post to her with a message that said - ""you look this beautiful today"". My little brother, ladies and gentlemen!! He's 19. 19!!! We never have seen anyone go on a date except in movies and stuff ig. And this guy was like 5yo just a couple years ago 🥺🥺When did he grow up so fast! 

N to top all that, he thanked me - he THANKED ME for helping him know how to treat a girl right! He thinks I'm nice. He trusts me. He ACTUALLY looks up to me!!🥺
I. Am. Melting! 
I'm happy a ton! Sorry if this is too long. To the ones who stuck till the end, you people are my angels. I just wanted to share this. ❤️

happy,"
Background-
So I'm a guy in uni and there's this girl I knew since two years ago. Sorry if this is not organized too well


We didn't really know each other well then, but we were mutual friends in the friend group. Then, there was a uni trip to an amusement park coming up, and since I didn't get to go in my first year I got a ticket. Unfortunately none of my other friends got tickets, but you know who did? Her. And that's where this all began.


Amusement Park Trip-
Despite not knowing each other well, and despite it being me and her alone on the trip, we had great chemistry. I hyped her up to go on the roller coasters, she held onto my sleeve in the haunted house and pretended like she wasn't scared, we got food together, played and lost the claw games together, and we even bought similar sweatshirts as souvenirs.


Dormant Interest-
Unfortunately, after that trip, we didn't keep up individual contact. We had academics and she was actually on dating apps at the time. But fast forward two years later and she wasn't on them anymore after a few bad experiences. We started talking more at friend hangouts and we both like to work out so we'd usually always get into some talk about that.


Finals Season-
Finals season was upon us, and the uni was having a lot of events to wrap up the year. Since her and I's schedules were the most free out of the friend group, a lot of the public meet ups we mentioned to the friend group ended up having only her and I going. We usually met outside in the sun on a picnic blanket, and she would crochet or listen to music and I'd watch or appreciate the weather and relax. Then at other events I noticed myself getting closer to her. We were spending more time together, and eventually, I realized I had feelings for her all along ever since the trip. Unfortunately, she's a year older, so she was graduating soon, and I started to get worried that it wouldn't work out. I had also had no dating experience prior so I was sort of lost. But I tried anyways, and that was the best decision I ever made.


Moment of Truth-
One day she mentioned watching a show as it was her favorite since it dealt with fitness and I then asked her if she would be down to watch it together so she can show me, just her and I. She said yes, and on the day of we couldn't go to our usual spot so we found a space under some white petal trees and set up a blanket. Halfway through I got the courage to ask her ""Can I put my arm around you?"" and I was so nervous but she said yes and I held her for the day, and while she was waiting for her ride home we basically awkwardly confessed to each other. I gave her time to think about her feelings and she came back to me the next day saying she had an interest i me and wanted to see where it went. She had also started to like me from the trip too, we were just dense and it was wrong place/time.


The Label-
Eventually we went on some small dates and we had some firsts- first time holding hands, kissing her forehead, then her lips, then making out. I got her flowers and made a card for a more ""proper"" confession and graduating gift, but we still hadn't said ""I love you"" or ""You're my bf/gf"" yet. I was on a trip for the summer but when I came back we met again, and she gave me a cute crochet plush and her own confession card where she told me she loved me and asked if I wanted to be her boyfriend, with cute boxes for ""yes"" or ""no"". Don't even need to say which one I picked lol.

Present Day-
Right now we're in a sort of distance relationship but we've met at least once a week and we're very communicative and supportive of each other. I think the temporary sadness of seeing others get into relationships except for me was worth it if it meant I could fall in love with her now. We're serious for now, so yeah just really happy with my first ever girlfriend.

happy,"I just want to say something here that maybe you'll scroll away but I wanted to share it. The thing I want to say is, I am so grateful for my boyfriend. It is Valentine's day today and although we are long distance he always makes me feel special and loved. Like today so far we have messaged but just before he started work we video called. However, he actually makes me feel special not just on days like this but every day. The way he looks at me, thinks of me and strives to make me happy throughout my life just makes me truly appreciate him. He is my support
and my joy. I have not yet recieved the gift or thing that he has planned for today but I know it will be from the heart. So I guess I'm just saying thank you to him in advance of this treatment but mostly thank you for being the man that lights up my days and for being who you are.

I hope we all get or have a partner in our life who makes us feel truly loved."
happy,"The last time I had one I was 8, it lasted 2years and I always wanted to try VTT. Always wanted my own bike to move to to work ect I am proud of myself"
happy,"My mum has always been big into sewing and is much better at it than I am, I lost my quilt when I was 19 and we had a flood and it broke my heart because I was planning on passing it onto my daughter. But out of the blue this arrived. My daughter loves it and it's an absolutely gorgeous quilt. It looks like it took an insane amount of time (from all the different patches, edging and lining I'd estimate about 30 hours) and it's got a whole story that my mum wrote out by hand. The nostalgia, happiness at seeing my daughters joy and appreciation for the effort my mum went to for her granddaughter has made me the most proud and happy son/father "
happy,One of my closest friends went to NYC in an au pair exchange and I painted one of my favorite photos of us  with watercolor and then I gave it to her at the airport before she got on the plane! 💗 She loved btw and it's now on her bedside table in her bedroom at her host family house. 
happy,Just wanted to share. 
happy,"Got my dog a toy today at a local ranch supply store. This was supposed to be the be all end all toy for destructive dogs. She managed to tear chunks out of it in 5 minutes flat. I wrote the company and said nice try, but it just didn't hold up. Company wrote back and said that only about 5% of dogs globally could defeat their rubber toys. As my puppy was one of those 5%, would I allow her to become a tester for their company? Heck yes, I'll let her do that. Whether they pay me, or whether they just send free toys, it's still a win for me and my American Bully XL.

ETA, this was an off brand toy, not the well known super duty one."
happy,Met my bestfriends girlfriend and when we were alone for a little bit she told me “he talks about you all the time and it’s really obvious you mean so much to him and he looks up to you. i’m really glad he has you he needs you”. It just felt so damn good man. Usually it’s people talking bad behind your back but he is praising me to his GIRLFRIEND. I feel so loved man.
happy,I have schizophrenia. I was never happy until I had kids. My kid did a play and I thought her role was so cool. They did game of thrones with Disney princess. Called games of tiaras she was snow white mother of dragons every one died and she got the throne. I was so happy. My life suck at her age my got beat up everyday.my sister wanted to be a only child. My uncle beat my aunt my other uncle beat his kids. My sister was raped. My dad held me and family hostage at gun point. I doing better. 
happy,"This is what I came into. My inner child couldn't be happier, and I started happy jumping upon seeing kid you not.

First time I tear up out of excitement and being emotionally touched
The cutest thing someone has ever done for me 🥺❤️"
happy,Just wanted to share pictures from where I started and where I am. I’m so grateful to have friends and family that have helped along the way.
happy,"
At school I hated working, would much rather be playing sports or video games. Throughout uni whilst I found some topics interesting, I hated any hard graft, would much rather be lounging about. I had kind of just accepted that I would forever just do my job to get paid then rush home at the end of the day. 

My first couple jobs were very much like that. I was there for a pay check, would not spend a second more than I needed to there. 

I’ve just had an incredibly busy/tiring/stressful week, and as I sit slumped on the sofa watching a film I find myself somewhat looking forward to Monday and to getting stuck right back into it? This is a completely alien concept for me and I’m not sure how to process it. I’m incredibly thankful and I just kind of wanted to get it off my chest without appearing like bragging to my friends. 

A) what do I do with this good energy? Do I just accept that I’m lucky and crack on?

B) I wanna hear about others that love their job- not the money or how easy it is, who really loves putting in effort and showing up Monday morning? And to those people how do I stay like this? I don’t want to get burned out I want to be happy going to work when I’m 60"
happy,"I'll get my certification in the mail soon. I was so nervous as the desktop was loading to give me my grade. I'm just happy to be done and over with it all. Thank god. 🙏🏼 I can't wait to get it in the mail. 

Please pray for me (if you pray) because I have a 100question exam that I'll be taking on my own time this weekend for Lean Six Sigma / project management. 🤞🏼 It's a 2hr test, 100 questions. "
happy,"I'm working on this AI chatbot app for a college project, and yesterday I encountered some errors causing the whole app to stop functioning and with the submission deadline just days away, I was freaking out. I've spent the last two days trying every fix I could think of but nothing worked. I was honestly starting to lose hope that I'd be able to get this thing running again in time.

This morning, I posted about the issue on a tech forum, desperate for any help I could get. That's when this dude reached out - he'd dealt with a similar error before and offered to walk me through solving it. He spends like 4-5 hours meticulous hours going through my code until we finally isolate and fix the bug. The guy even shared some of his own confidential API keys with me, just to ensure my app could run properly.

A total stranger devoting half his day to helping a random guy on the internet get unstuck. He's got his own shit to worry about, but he still took the time and made the effort, simply out of the goodness of his heart. We're from completely different countries, he doesn't know anything about me , but he came through in the clutch.

It's easy to think the internet is just a cesspool, but then you connect with someone who reminds you that good people are out there. You just have to be lucky enough to find them every once in a while. Somehow I managed to cross paths with this generous soul and now we're internet buddies. It's small acts of kindness like that which restores your faith in humanity. "

happy,"I was born in the early 80's and I have been obsessed with The Gremlins ever since it was released. I told my husband I begged my parents for Spike from the movie for 3 years in a row when I was younger. Of course, that wasn't a possibility, but it didn't quite sink in until I was older. I opened a specialty toy set with a large Spike Gremlin and a little Gizmo yesterday; it arrived a bit late due to the first one getting lost in the mail and major shipping delays for the replacement. It was such a nice surprise during the cold snap here and the first weekend of Dry January."
happy,"Ever since I was a teenager I wanted a pair but they were always too expensive for me. My BF took the plunge and for my birthday (which is in a month, but he wanted me to get the most out of these boots during January lol) him and my best friends split the costs on the gift. They are in the box next to my bed as I'm typing this. I feel like a little child that got a very precious toy and can't sleep without hugging it. I almost ran up the wall when I first tried them on.

I wanted to share this here. I feel bougie and expensive with these Demonia boots lol"
happy," 

On Feb 15th I was 214 pounds . Went on a low calorie diet and eating only once or twice a day of lean chicken and 3 veggies and only drinking water/water with no sugar flavoring. 40 minutes at 3mph daily on the treadmill and 20 minutes daily of benchpresses and curls . Today I'm at 198 !!!!!!! Still got a ways to go my goal is 180 but getting there!!!!

I'm excited."

happy,One day at a time.
happy,"Recently I suffered an accident at a grappling competition. Large fracture on my right leg and 2 smaller ones near the ankle. 

&#x200B;

You would think this is a extremely low point in my life to get such a crippling injury, well you would be quite wrong. Part of is perhaps that in the end I will make a full recovery after a few months so I would be left in the end with just the humbling experience and the attitude that people now have with me.

&#x200B;

I used to think my friends are only friends with me because I am to use of them and because we have similar hobbies where we train together. Used to think I was the after thought of my family as the middle child. My feelings were always less important than my sisters, I was always supposed to support them if something happened but it never felt like it was given back.

&#x200B;

Well not only has my family offered help to even moving in with me to help me out and interrupting their lives to do so, not only have my friends all offered to drive me to the hospital and come to my place to play board games and entertain me, and even offering to do my university work but even random strangers on the street stopping their cars and asking me where am I headed and to drive me home. Old women offering to carry my bag and even the meanest looking face tattoo dudes offering help without even being asked or remotely needed.

&#x200B;

I am a 23 year old dude, used to feel alone in the world where nobody would care if something happened to me to now feel like society actually cares. Ofcourse Ive had a negative experience too but positive experience outweighs easily the one bad experience. To the people that are like the ones that help, thank you, you have no idea how much you help. I certainly would strive to become more like the selfless people that helped me when I fully recover. And dont judge the mean looking people by appearance, maybe thats how people also viewed me before, they turn out to be the most sympathetic of them all."
happy,I've been exercising and training everyday. I reach one goal and improved on another. Every morning I do fourty sit ups. Now I get the fourty in but I have to usually do them I sets of ten or take a break. Today I did a complete set of fourty with no breaks all one set so I'm very happy about that. Also yesterday in my running I went further than usual and was less winded. I run in intervals so I was less winded in intervals. So I'm very happy about those things.
happy,"There used to be a falling down house across the street from me. Some realtor picked it up on a property tax sale and tore it down. Should have been no big deal and just a normal tear down and rebuild, right? Along the way, I noticed it was taking forever to build 2 homes they decided to build on the lot. It's been almost 2 years since construction started, 1 house is complete, the 2nd is about half finished. I'm home with a work injury, so there isn't much else to watch but this build and the boob tube. And of course, my dogs go berserk whenever people show up over there.

Dogs are going off one day and I look to see what set them off. It's a mold abatement company. I didn't really think too much of it, and a year passed before the house was complete. My friend tells me after she has signed the contract that she's moving across the street from me. That's when the alarm bells went off in my head. I let her know to be thorough in her inspection because they'd already treated this brand-new home for mold. Her jaw hits the floor, and she says that the owner/realtor (both are the same person) didn't disclose that.

There are other problems, like none of the dirt from digging in water lines, nor any gravel in preparation for driveways and sidewalks being compacted. None of the cement has rebar to reinforce and strengthen it to stand up to our winters. The un-compacted water line trenches run under both driveways. I guess hauling off piles of dirt wasn't a clue to the builder that it might be a problem later.

Final inspection day comes, and it takes 2 pry bars operated by 2 fairly large men to get the access to the crawl space open because it's so wet in the crawl space it has made the wood swell quite a bit. Not only is the crawlspace infested with mold, but against code, the crawl space wasn't built with any ventilation. So my friend got out of the contract, and the owner/realtor will likely lose her real estate license for not making proper disclosures.

Yes, it sucks that she has to look for another house, but she's so happy she didn't get stuck in a mold infested trap. And funnily enough, you can hear fans running from over there 24/7 in both houses."
happy,"There isn’t much that brings me pleasure anymore but i am so grateful for warm blankets. I just put a blanket in the drier until it was warmed up, i took it out and laid under it for a few seconds and it was one of the most pleasurable things I have ever felt in my life. I just felt so safe, so comforted and loved and even though i was completely alone i didn’t feel like it at all. All of the tension in my body just completely went away and breathing became so easy, my lungs felt so open and every time i breathed i could feel my breath traveling throughout my whole body. The pleasurable sensation that started in my chest began to expand, until it expanded to the blanket itself. I didn’t even feel like a separate entity anymore, nothing was separate, all that exists is warmth, and every aspect of my surroundings including myself is a part of the Great Warmness. I was so affectionate i started smiling so intensely and i felt so happy i started crying in the middle of nowhere. It was beautiful. Why is a heated piece of cloth capable of this?? Even though it only lasts a few seconds, it makes everything around me seem perfect and it makes everything seem okay. It’s the only friend i have. I love the warmth of heated blankets so much and i am so thankful for its sweet embrace, i don’t deserve it at all"
happy,I absolutely love pineapple and strawberries! I buy them precut because it’s time consuming but one day I was rambling with my mom complaining about how expensive it is to buy precut fruits so she took it upon herself to buy some pineapples and cut them up and wash the strawberries! ☺️ I’ll finish them in like 2 days lol

happy,"My parents and grandparents gave me a surprise party for my birthday (not too far from now) and almost all my friends were there, including one that is like an older sister to me. They got me the best gifts I could ever ask for. I'm over the  moon and so grateful for them, and, honestly, I forgot the party was technically about me because I was busy thinking about them and how happy they've made me.

So, although this comes from a total stranger, you always have somebody who will come through for you. And if you don't yet, you will. There's always somebody."
happy,"Hi everyone!

So my girlfriend and I (both women <3 if that's an issue for you, please just don't interact with this post) started dating at the end of January this year. This was after my ex-boyfriend and I broke up a few weeks before (we were together 4 years but it had been over a year that it wasn't working out. I don't want comments on this, you'll understand why later).

I have a lot of anxiety around relationships. My ex verbally abused me for the first part of our relationship, and then he was never physically there because he had to stay back home for understandable reasons. I was unhappy. I did things that hurt him too, and I've looked into why I did what I did and am learning to overcome what happened between us (the things he used to say to me in anger outbursts).

Now I've been friends with my girlfriend for 3 ish years now. I always thought she was so gorgeous and funny. I got to spending more time with her and next thing I knew, I was falling in love. I don't know what I did to get so lucky. Whenever I come forward about my feelings about something, she NEVER gets mad at me. She's so calm, so chill. She reassures me gently, and listens to me while explaining to me why this is okay, that I am valid. When I'm down for whatever reason, she makes me laugh without a problem. I can do anything with her and we can make it fun! I laugh harder with her than anyone else. She engages in things that I like and genuinely enjoys them, and vice versa.

The other day, we were snuggling and chatting in bed. I don't remember what she said, but it really hit home and I just felt my eyes start to water. She asked me what was wrong, and I just looked at her and said ""I just realized how unsafe I felt in the world before you"". She smiled and pulled me in, she let me cry on her for a few seconds.

She lets me talk about my ex and what happened. She knows I'm far from romantically or sexually interested in him anymore. She's so kind about the fact that I do miss him sometimes as a friend (I mean, 4 years with someone and talking almost every day is hard to let go of). I don't think about it often, really. She lets me talk about the things he did/said to me that hurt me deeply. I mean even yesterday we were talking about some of the horrible things he said and she looked at me and said ""I want to show you what a soft love looks like."" I just stared at her in awe and shock. I was frozen in place, just...speechless. She makes it safe for me to express excitement about things I love, she doesn't judge me for the things I enjoy, and SHE DOESN'T GET MAD AT ME!!! She doesn't insult me beyond what we both agree are jokes, she gently redirects me towards healthier behaviors for my mental health and for the relationship, we're both working together to be healthy and I just...wow....She's even coming home with me for Easter weekend (we don't celebrate but hey, why not).

I'm beyond happy with her. Maybe it's too soon to tell, I don't know, but I want to marry her someday. I really think this is it, that she's my future wife. She's currently asleep in my bed. I want her to be my love for the rest of our lives. She is truly and unequivocally the most beautiful person I've ever met (inside and out). I can't see a day where I don't find her funny anymore, where I don't find her attractive anymore, where I don't want to run to her to tell her about my day. I want to share my world with her. She's my best friend and more. I've never been happier, and I've never felt more like me.

If you read this whole thing, thank you so much :) I know it's a lot, it's messy, and honestly I can't even say everything I feel about this woman because I just don't have the words to express the deep, honest love I have for her. I wish you all the most WONDERFUL day!"
happy,"Is it girl math when you're on your weight loss journey and you're down 2-3 dress sizes so you have to buy new clothes but it's okay cos smaller clothes are cheaper than plus size anyway?

THE ONLY WAY IS DOWN!! 🥳"
happy,They have had issues with past pregnancies and I know it weighed heavy on them. I'm just so happy this pregnancy worked out for them. Their daughter is so beautiful and I can't help but share it wherever I can
happy,"I’m nervous but also really proud of myself because I made a doctors appointment and I haven’t been in five or six years because we don’t have public transpertation in my town, I can’t drive and people that could drive me always had something going on, also I have some pretty bad phone anxiety. I have no idea what I’ll need to do, because its been so long, and even before than it had been another five or so years, so I’m at a lost, but super excited that I’m finally getting things done."
happy,"JNJDSB I know this might not sound like a big deal, but I've been so stressed about my storage because of how much I need for the software I want to install and because I can't convince my parents I need an additional drive because I own a lot of usbs already. But my usb with the largest storage...IT WAS NOT WORKING. *FOR YEARS.*

And so just few minutes ago, I found out...*I can reformat it, even though all the data would be erased, it would hopefully work*....

That doesn't sound that great, ***right?*** SO I PLUGGED IN MY USB TO REFORMAT IT AND IT'S PERFECTLY FINE??????????????

My guess is that a while I ago I was troubleshooting drives, transferring files, running security software and whatnot, and around that time I repaired the drive, but just didn't notice it or forgot about it. 😭

BUT I AM SO HAPPY. LIKE SO GODDAMN HAPPY. It's 1:43 am, I'm so happy I considered waking up my parents and my siblings to tell them that it works. I am so so so so so incredibly happy.

Like, there's so much things that were being held back because of this stress, and now it's like ***FREEDOM.*** **And like things are finally looking forward. AND THERE'S SO MUCH MORE I CAN DO NOW!!! SO MUCH MORE TO TEST!!!! I AM SO EXCITED.**   


AND I'M SO HAPPY THAT ALL MY FILES ARE THERE. I've been missing so many stories I've written and worked on, along with programs I've written, now I can finally get them back!!!!!!! 😁💖"
happy,"I never thought giving a gift would make me so happy. I live in India and my best friend always had this big desire to visit a special place for worshipping Krishna. Unfortunately, that place is very far away. But then I found out there is a similar place much closer to where we live, so I decided to take her there as a surprise.

I didn't tell her where I intended to take her. I just asked her when she had her holidays and around christmas we planned the trip. It took 4 hours to reach there and when we were just about to reach I gave her a note saying 'We will visit your favourite place one day soon. Until that time enjoy this little surprise from me'. When we were at front gate and she realized where we were she became so mesmerised. Seeing her so happy I felt very gratified. That was the first time I realized that love is about giving cause the more you give the more blissful you become.

We visited every temple, the people were chanting Hare Krishna and she was enjoying every little thing. She even took some of the soil from there as a memory. Seeing that she loved my surprise there was different level of joy within me and I truly felt what Sadhguru says 'How deeply you touch another life is how rich your life is'."
happy,"Poor thing was almost dried up. I put it in my houseplant, watered it, and stuck some dead leaves in the pot. Looking a little more closely at the pictures, I could’ve nursed it a little longer (was worried the pot was too small for it), but I tried my best. I didn’t see it at the time. Nonetheless, I am so glad it’s alive and better!
Wanted to share our little victory with someone🪱"
happy,"My dad and his girlfriend probaply tought that i needed a younger sibling to get my s*** together lol i visited them every weekend she didn't complain when i said that i wanted to change diapers ""oh yeah? go for it sweetie"" god i can still smell the 💩 lol"
happy,"We found out she had uterine cancer last week, and they scheduled her for a hysterectomy immediately. She had surgery this morning, and it went great. Minimum blood loss, no sign of cancer. I'm so relieved I can't even tell you. Best day of my life."
happy,"when i think about the definition of love, i see him and all he does for me"
happy,Change is a bitch. 
happy,"For context there's this one character that I absolutely adore from an old book series I love, we'll call him H. I've known H for just a year and he has been the biggest comfort character out there. I relate to his character and his upbringing, and his own character has managed to actually make me realize more things of myself and grow as a person. I also even write fanfiction of him, which I feel like is average for a girl my age so I am not that embarrassed. I also of course have a deep crush on him which I joke of with my friends, calling H my boyfriend and such (secretly I actually love these jokes, though I'm too shy to admit that, haha). In other words, H is an amazing character and I am surprised he is not anywhere near mainstream! Though I am glad as I can keep him all to myself now, haha.

I was having a rough day that day, my period had started, my dad was pestering about me going to high school (for health reasons I'll never be able to attend one which upset me a lot), and I was stressing over a theme coding project I had been working on for two days as a gift for a friend. I finished the code early this day and was too scared of sending it to my friend because I deemed it 'aesthetically unpleasing'. In the end I did send it, and then immediately deleted it. But then I realized that I deleted it too late, as now my friend had the code file. The absolute panic I felt in that moment before he revealed to me that he actually liked it! But what I didn't expect was for him to send something back for me. The squeal I let out when I saw it one would think I had won a million dollars! :) It was a drawing of H and me! Let me tell you that my friend is probably one of the best artists I've ever known or seen, so to get a drawing was a blessing itself. But a personal one of my ultimate teen girl fantasy no matter how cringe it was? My heart clenched and I swear I started to feel tears bubbling up inside of me. I am still continuing on expressing my gratefulness to him hours later lol.

He didn't even have to do that for me, yet he did. I am so grateful of my best friend and I absolutely love him with all my heart. It's things like these that make me grateful of meeting him and also of other people in my life, and that I am not truly alone. I wish I realized sooner how much he has done for me. Each time I think about it my eyes brim up with emotional and absolute happy tears. I've been so used to gifts and presents that never truly fit my interests or were considerate enough, but he? He knows me too well to know how to make me the happiest girl in the world. We both jokingly call each other brothers from another mothers, but I realize that I genuinely see him as one, which is making me far too emotional too living as an only child and being the only teen in my family and relatives, so I never had a close relationship like that with someone around my age.

Lesson of the day (for me at least) is that you are never truly alone, and that there are people out there who will embrace any part of you, even your embarrassing fictional crushes. And to also tell my friends more that I love them. :)"
happy,"I love people. I find it so fascinating how incredibly intricate every single person is, and there’s billions of us! I genuinely love seeing people walking outside or at school. I’m excited to see my friends, yes, but I also love the fact that I get to see everyone else’s faces every day. I’ve never really empathized with those that say they hate the majority of people. I get being hurt and losing the ability to trust, I can understand it, but I don’t think I could really just hate people in general. I love people’s faces, not just the eyes, but the noses and the smiles and the way skin crinkles. I get so excited at the prospect of meeting new people, because that’s one more entire life I get to interact with! That person an entire world of inner thought and experiences that is allowing me to take part in their experience of the world. Idk I just really love people a whole lot."
happy,"I’ve done an emotional 180 over the past two years for the better! These books have helped me more than therapy, antidepressants, and sleeping pills. Some of them contain spirituality but can be enjoyed by any religion. I tell everyone I know about them and just wanted to share here!"
happy,"I just feel ecstatic this week full of pride for myself.  I grew up around alot of drugs and awful people, not awful in the sense that they did bad things but awful in the sense they had lost themselves in a pit of drugs and self depreciation.  My mom and my grandma were both addicted to opioid painkillers for like all of my childhood and I never knew my dad so my grandpa raised me and he was a great man he taught me alot of things a dad should like how to shave how to treat people and generally what it means to be a good person.  But nobody lives forever and when he passed things got worse and I was eventually taken by Arkansas CPS when i was 16 in late 2018 and given to my Great Grandma.  Lived with her for a bit then she decided she didn't want me and my oldest sister.  It hurt alot hearing someone just say they didn't want you when you expect them to care for you.  So I was placed in the foster system in January 2019 met lots of good people while I was in the system and I still talk to my foster mom.  I got out of the system in 2022 and left Kansas to come back home to Arkansas and I found myself surrounded by a whole new side of my family my mom had hidden from me my whole life, My Aunt Jamie and her wife Trey helped me get on my feet and my first place.  But me being new to this whole thing after about a year I lost a good job and in turn lost my place.  And then I met my Dad and he's just such a good person who's given me a firm guiding hand in the right direction which I exactly what I needed so now im an Assistant Manager at my local Dominoes and I plan on working here until September or November to say I have a year's worth of Management Experience then looking for a better paying job and this Saturday I'm moving into a new Apartment using all the money I've worked so hard for to save up and I'm just so happy and proud of myself.  And I'm thankful that I got to meet all this family I never knew cared so much about me for so long.  2025 is going to be my year, I hope to finally be able to really worm on myself and keep this winning streak going because this has been the best year or two of my life I'm happier than I've ever been and it's all thanks to my new friends and family. I'm learning to survive and I have to support system I need to finally make myself the person I want to be and I will never take it for granted. "
happy,"So happy right now. 

I made some new friends through work. The three of us clicked immediately on the first day. 

Tonight, we went to dinner at my favorite restaurant (Korean BBQ). We ate so much great food and drank so much delicious soju lol

I dont remember the last time I laughed so hard. My cheeks were flushed and I smiled the entire drive home. 

Feeling so grateful for the good people in my life 🥰☺️"
happy,"Two years ago I was in the darkest place I’ve ever reached and I’m sure it wasn’t that bad but for my young brain at the time, I thought I’d never get to be happy.I posted in TW depression pages/ suicide daily.  Being happy was a foreign concept to me my whole teenage hood and child hood I often had depression Until I worked on it hard very hard. 

Fast forward to today, I am currently laying in bed so content next to my husband and my cats are cuddled up between us purring and I often find myself crying since getting pregnant that I’m happy and grateful I am to be here, but !! I was smiling  and happy crying at life before I got flooded with pregnancy hormones. 

Long story short I think I’m finally happy I am confidently able to say it.

happy,"Figuring out my future

I know this sounds so silly but I F18 and finally had the epiphany of how important school, college and university is.
 
The majority of people in my area aren’t taught this in school therefore others my age drop out of college, do boring 9-5 jobs and don’t see the importance of their education.

Luckily I go to a college closer to the capital city of my country where everyone has a better work ethic, than the locals I’ve been influenced by. 

I used to be so confused as to my my peers would be so motivated to go to class everyday, work hard, revise for exams etc, usually I would skip class, stay home, not revise.
Until I realised the importance of how these few years of education, trial and error and putting in your best actually shape your entire life! 

I was reading up on the entry requirements for the courses I’d want to do in uni and never realised you’d actually need good grades, and a college degree etc.

I know I seem silly for only realising all of this now, but I’m actually feeling very hopeful for my future and I’m looking forward to it.
I haven’t felt like this before and hope this post can help more less educated people like me! Better late than never! 💛💛"
happy,"IM GONNA HAVE A FEAST
"
happy,"I (20f) grew up with an emotionally abusive mother who neglected me and favoured my two older half brothers. I grew up on tv because I was a socially awkward kid and any friends I did have would want to hang with my brothers instead (we have a 6 and 7 year age gap. So when I was 8 they were teens). I saw that on a lot of my favourite shows there would be at least one picnic episode where the family would go to a park with the classic red and white blanket and eat out of a basket. I always wanted that. I would ask my mom if we could do it with her, my brothers and me ( my parents divorced when I was three and my dad had custody on weekends) but my brothers just wanted to go to the skatepark with their junkie friends. My mom chose them over me every time. So when I was 14 I stopped asking cause I knew that the one day I wanted with my family didn’t matter as much as wasting hours watching my brothers do the same old tricks. 
Anyway I haven’t seen my mother since I was 15 when my dad got full custody of me after my mom disappeared with her boyfriend of the week for a couple days. I have a carer cause I was diagnosed with autism at 13. I asked if we could do a picnic one day with just us fully prepared to be rejected but she said yes. So tomorrow we’re buying a basket and food and sitting on a blanket in the park having a picnic. 

Also mom… Fuck you. "
happy,"It looks like no big thing, normal achievements for most people, but 2 years ago I was depressed, no job, no money, no friends, single, my mental health wasn't good at all.

happy,"There was this local Mexican joint housed inside a run-down, little-used gas station. Classic ""hole in the wall"" type setup, which should have been this community's first clue that the food would be stupendous. They had these chorizo burritos with spicy sauce that just spoke to me on some metaphysical level.

Unfortunately, last summer they announced they were shutting down. They just weren't making enough money. I was despondent -- nothing else in this two-horse town even came close to approximating the culinary excellence this place provided.

They reopened yesterday. I was finally able to get in there today, and I swear to you that the clouds parted and angels sang as I took my first bite. It's every bit as good as I remembered.

I'm recommending them to everybody I know and hoping they manage to hold on this time."

happy,"Basically what the title says. I don't really have anyone else to share this with, but I feel quite accomplished. My story is basically growing up poor, a bunch of federal and private loans to get a degree (out of state, had to escape the crabs in that barrel), loan to get a decent vehicle, and then I got a job as far away as I could manage. Now, just shy of my 27th birthday, all of my loans are paid off right as my employer is paying to send me back to get a master's degree in my field (I start next term). It feels like I'm free, truly free, for the first time in my life. "

But today was one of those days that people just make me and my heart smile. At my PM shift today a man and two girls (they looked 4 and 6, I was not very sure) came into the pharmacy and handed me one prescription. The smaller one literally said “doctor, you’re so cute” (im not a doctor but i appreciated the compliment). Thought I heard her wrong so I told her to repeat herself and it made me really happy that I giggled under my mask and couldnt stop smiling. While they were waiting for their prescription filled, the older sister said it was cold and the younger offered her jacket and started taking it off and putting it on her which i thought was extremely sweet. They were sitting and talking, their dad just hugging them. When I finally dispensed her medications, the older one said “thank you, bye, cute doctor”. Their dad just laughed at the whole thing but I feel like I have to credit good parenting. This has to be the most wholesome interaction."

I helped them a lot with their applications and talked through deciding where to apply, etc. I've been getting periodic texts from them over the last few weeks as they've received their admissions (and one rejection so far) and it's been such an honor to share in their excitement. They even said I'm one of the first people they want to tell and that just put me over the moon.

Today they got an acceptance into a BIG school and one that was sort of a ""shoot for the stars"" application and I just shrieked and hollered when I got their message. Tears are streaming down my cheeks, but they are happy happy tears. What a privilege to be able to experience this joy with them. Truly an honor. I'm so lucky."
happy,"My son loves to play outside. The house next to us is being rebuilt so it is unoccupied at the moment. There is a small pond located on the property so every now and then we venture over there to see what sort of wildlife we can spot. Yesterday, disappointment struck when we arrived to the pond and didn’t spot any animals. Normally there’s at least a few ducks, but not today. After about 10 minutes he looked down at the ground, picked up a very high-quality stick, and threw it into the water. The stick struck the water. The splash made him so happy he exclaimed, “I did it dada, I did it.” It took me a second but then I realized, wow he is so happy because of the stick hitting the water! Mind you, I have never thrown anything into this pond before, so this was just his primal instinct telling him “pick up stick, throw stick water, stick make splash, make boy happy”… anyways I thought I’d share this because it was enough to make a grown-man cry. Such simple acts can bring so much joy. We’re such simple creatures haha. Have a great day everyone

happy,"I (30f) have been married to my wonderful husband for 4yrs and we dated for 2 before getting married. My in-laws have been wonderful to me the entire time. My FIL is like a second father and my MIL is like the mother I never had. Through the duration of my relationship with my husband, I have also been helping him heal his relationship with his parents, i.e making sure boundaries are maintained and communication lines remain open and honest whilst still being kind and considerate. 

My father suddenly passed away about a month ago and it's been really difficult as it was very unexpected but my husband, my friends and my inlaws have really rallied around and made sure I am okay. I've spoken to my husband and my inlaws and it has been decided that they will move in with us into my father's house to 1: help us with some bills and maintaining my father's property and 2: help them because they do not own the place they live now and will need some help as they are getting closer to retirement age. 

My FIL is disabled and on SSA benefits. I am also trying to get disability as I have not been able to work in almost 2 years due to a variety of health issues. My FIL has been so understanding and helpful with tips and tricks on how to do things around the house while chronically in pain or what processes are helpful in going through the disability thing. My MIL has been a real trooper through all of this and has helped keep me grounded as well. My husband is actually excited to live with his parents again because while I understand that his relationship with his parents is completely different than what I had with my dad, I don't want him to go through what I'm going through with any regrets and such. 

It just feels like a spotlight in a very dark time and I really love my husband and my in-laws. Even my brother in-law and future sister-in-law have been super amazing and accommodating and kind. I really love the family I married into and l hope they know I love them too."
happy,"To all my fellow singles out there and to those that are missing/can’t be with their significant other today, remember this:

You have the ability to light your own spark.  We all want that sense of completion with someone else by our side.  We all fantasize about being whole.  The over-commercialization of romantic love makes it even worse. The truth is, we are whole just as we are.  Sure we all come with baggage but that doesn’t make us incomplete.  This is your reminder that you don’t have to go through today feeling alone.  This is your chance to pour all of your love into the most important person in your life: you!

Right now, I’m sitting with a glass of my favorite (Verdi) wine, snuggling with Bruno the stuffed red dragon and my two cats.  I bought myself flowers again this year and added the purple rose because they are my favorite.  I lit my favorite Apotheke candle.  There’s salmon broiling in the oven that I’ll be pairing with  broccoli and basmati rice.  Later, I’ll cuddle under the blankets and watch a movie.  It’s all I’d want to do with a partner.  Why should being single change that?

How are you spending today?  I hope it is filled with peace and not a reminder of what could have/should have been.  Seize your happiness.  You deserve it."
happy,"“How is her brother doing?”

Weird, right? Ill make it make sense!

My best friend passed away 2 years ago, we have guardianship of her 17f daughter, and are active in her 18transM’s son’s life. We’ll call him K.

I have boomer parents. I would gently correct them when they referred to the kids as “the girls,” or used the incorrect pronouns for K. I was understanding that they were going to mess up here and there because of the generational gap, but figured after consistent gentle corrections, they would get there sooner than later.

I was wrong. After nearly 2 years, I felt I gave them more than enough grace to get it right. My mom has been the main culprit of the two because she always wants to talk about the kids, while my dad never really asked/talked about them as often (man of few words type). I started getting more aggravated and upset every time my mom would ask “how are the girls doing?” After 2 years, I just felt like my parents just didn’t care enough to even try to understand. I stopped bringing the kids around my family because I felt like it was always a negative experience for them, and refused to subject them to that kind of environment.

Fast forward to last week: I was talking to my dad on the phone. He was asking about 17f because I had mentioned she was starting school again soon and she just had a birthday. After we were done talking about her, he said the sentence:

“How is her brother doing?”

0 coaching. No correcting. Just him using his own words. 

I couldn’t believe it and actually stuttered a bit after that one sentence. That was the first time I heard one of my parents affirm his gender identity. 

My dad does care and has been listening. My heart exploded. I had hella tears.

I love my dad and am happy."

happy,"My mum has always been big into sewing and is much better at it than I am, I lost my quilt when I was 19 and we had a flood and it broke my heart because I was planning on passing it onto my daughter. But out of the blue this arrived. My daughter loves it and it's an absolutely gorgeous quilt. It looks like it took an insane amount of time (from all the different patches, edging and lining I'd estimate about 30 hours) and it's got a whole story that my mum wrote out by hand. The nostalgia, happiness at seeing my daughters joy and appreciation for the effort my mum went to for her granddaughter has made me the most proud and happy son/father "
happy,Got boba and a sandwich from my favorite Vietnamese fusion place to celebrate!
happy,"
Started a new job in February and became fast friends with Amanda. Her friendship means the world to me. Even though she is 18 years younger than me. We just love being friends. Yesterday we got our nails done and had dinner and drinks. 
I laughed so much my cheeks hurt. ☺️😊
We even got drinks that look like us 😂🤣"
happy,"Hey all, today I woke up and stepped on a weight scale and saw it was 158.5lbs :) I was around 202lbs when I started and it's amazing I reached into the 150 range, the last recorded weight of me I can remember was being around 160 a couple years back and it has only gone up since then. The fact I'm lower than that makes me extremely proud of myself and that change really is possible! 

It really helps I also have my boyfriend supporting me and he's one of my main motivators, he helps me feel secure and safe :D

There were times I ""failed"" and felt terrible about myself that I didn't keep myself in check, then I always tell myself, ""it's a marathon, not a race"" and that along the way you will have difficulties snacking, plateaus, and others where you just go beyond your calories for the day. But also, times where you'll do it and be succcessful. In the end they all add up and you will see that no matter what, that you DID lose weight because you didn't give up regardless of all the missteps. The smallest steps are my favorite, esp at the beginning! Because something is working. The scale isn't always accurate and fluctuates, so I take pictures and the differenc is very noticable :)

Super proud of myself, and thankful to my boyfriend in this journey."
happy,"He loves history , spiders , technology , art and America . He’s got the most wonderful blue eyes and he likes to play in the snow like me. 

It’s never been about his appearance or anything material . I love his mind. I love speaking with him. I love every word out of his mouth. I’ve truly never felt such a deep passion for somebody. 

He’s 30 and I’m 25 and I swear I went 25 years of my life searching for a mind and soul like his . 

I love when we passionately flirt with each other and talking about breathing each other in and caressing each other . 

I love staying up late at night messaging him till I fall asleep and hearing him say his praises to me . 

C I love you forever and I want to be with you forever like this 

Give it 2 more years when I’m done with school and I think we’ll get married and by 5 more I think we might be able to have a family .. 

I wanna spend every thanksgiving and Christmas with you for the rest of my life 

C …. Please stay with me forever … you’re a beaming star in my night sky "
happy,"So, as the title says, I started driving today. It was a motorcycle, no less. For some context, I'm 26 and never been in the driver's seat.

I've had Daisy (name of my bike) about as long as I've had a motorcycle license - about a year - but I haven't been able to put her on the road for various reasons, the funniest of which being the government and insurance companies typically don't like it when your 500lb death rocket was purchased with a lawn mower battery installed.

That's not all of it. Daisy needed a lot of work. But she finally met all the requirements to be put on the road just this morning, and I rode all day today. Let me tell you, it was worth every drop of sweat, every frustrated cuss, and of course every penny.

I knew driving would be fun, but I never could've predicted the extent of such. I was so calm just driving around my neighborhood. Everything could go wrong, and I knew it. But I didn't care. If it happens, I'll handle it like I was taught. All I could feel was joy."
happy,"I think I may have perfected my winged liner on slightly hooded eyes! And I tried out a purple liner which makes my brown eyes pop, especially the hazel and green flecks. Just super excited about it and wanted to share!"
happy,"I’m in community college, and I found that for this semester (spring semester) I’d gotten a bad English professor. I received a 25/50 on an assignment due to not formatting it correctly - on ratemyprofessor, many students were complaining about his oddly specific formatting rules (this man expected us to read five pages to adhere to his formatting guidelines… no thanks!) I’d actually started the assignment I received a 25/50 on early and had trouble submitting it in the docx form he really wanted us to submit it in, had to stop my Child Development Zoom meeting to call my college’s tech support at nighttime just to find a way to submit this assignment. This professor said he “wasn’t sure” and that I “still had time to call” when I asked him if I’d receive a 0 if I was unable to get the document submitted by the deadline even though I mentioned I’d started it early and that it was done. 

After much crying yesterday when seeing I had a 25/50 (this lowered my grade to a D+… I’ve never had a D+ in an English class) I simply decided, even though it means I’ll only be taking three courses this semester, to just drop the class. I have a job, I don’t know what I see myself doing in the future, and I felt like I just don’t have time for this, so I chose to drop the class. No extra stress needed. And I have no regrets about dropping it."
happy,"I've been sad for nearly 2 years after my best friend completely moved on from me after 13 years. I'm not longer angry or sad about it. 

I can't change it. She's happy now, and that's all I wish for her. I'm at peace with the whole situation at last. I'm happy knowing she's happy, and that we can still be friends, even if we're not as close. 

I think of our memories fondly, and not in sadness. And I feel so much more free, it's always been in the back of my mind since it happened, and when I first thought of her today I just felt alright. Life will do what it will. I absolutely can't wait to make new friends"

Then when I got to the Dunkin drive thru who do I see in front of me….. it’s him.

The gentleman in front of you already paid” it’s the little things. y’all I’m so in love 🥰 "
happy,"After going through so much school, putting out so many applications, I was offered my dream role right after graduation and I am so excited and happy I can’t even sleep! Really just wanted to share how at peace and grateful I’m feeling in this moment :) "
happy,"She told me near the end of January of this year that she is gay. Since then she's been a lot more sociable and is flashing that gorgeous, radiant smile of hers a lot more often. She called me this morning (her mom has custody on weekends) and told me all about this girl and their date, and it's the happiest I've ever heard her sound.

I am so unbelievably proud of my little girl. I'm smiling ear to ear thinking about how happy she must be to be living as her true self. She is my world, and her happiness is my happiness."

happy,"After 3 years of trying and IVF I'm now in my 28th week of pregnancy. 

My contract at work is ending before I go on maternity leave and I can't wait to have extra time to do all kinds of stuff for baby and the house in general. 

My husband is amazing and supportive in every way imaginable. 

My relationship with my parents have strengthened over the last couple of years and especially now that I'm pregnant. 

My friends write to me often even if we don't have as much time to see each other as we would like. 

I'm so happy I could burst with joy and gratitude. 

I wish everyone could feel this feeling but I'm scared if I talk too much about all the good things in my life it would come of as bragging?

Does anyone else have these thoughts?
How should I deal with it?

Thank you in advance and sorry for formatting I'm on my phone. "

happy,"For me, the first thing I used to do was check my emails but it was super stressful, and also my whole day would be bad if the email was crucial and msg was bad but when I stumbled across this quote from Sadhguru life isn't the same. 'When you wake up in the morning, the first thing you should do is Smile. You are Alive! Is that not the greatest blessing and reason enough to Smile?'  
  
So every day when I wake up I smile not towards anybody, I just smile. This very small act has changed my attitude to look toward life :)

happy,"I saw an FZR400 at a bike show last year and knew that it was my bike. I needed one for when I passed my A2. I was told to try a bike I could ""fit on"", and to get something smaller like my boyfriend's CBR400RR. But I got what I WANTED, not what I felt I had to settle for. And now I've started riding it on the road, I can confidently say that I'm so incredibly happy and proud of myself for getting the bike I wanted 🥰"
happy,"The first woman I ever fell in love with was simply a victim of circumstances at the time.  Despite my maturity and the intensity of our bond, we were four years apart during a time that just wouldn't have been fair for us to continue.

A failed marriage and one child each later, she called me out of the blue.  I'm barely 6 months removed from the end of an 8 year marriage.  I thought about calling this woman weeks after it ended, but it wouldn't have been fair.  She and I deserve the time and space to explore our relationship without the cloud of my divorce hanging over it.

Last monday when I was out of town, she called me on a whim.  The universe told her to so loudly that she stopped what she was doing to reach out.  She had no idea of my circumstance (unless she's lying, which is way out of her character).  When her name popped up on my phone, my belly fell straight through my ass and every hair and goosebump on my body sprang to attention.

We've texted and talked every day since.  Like teenagers.  It's amazing.  Each of our kids got sick the day I got back from my business trip.  Twice our plans to reconnect physically have been delayed by the universe.  I am still on cloud 9.  I don't know where it's heading, aside from unbelievable sex. I do know that the connection that her and I have maintained through the years, despite the distance and separation, is unlike anything I've shared with anyone before.  

I'm terrified of how quickly our energy reconnected. Having had a week and two cancelled meetings to build the tension and bond through words and phone calls has been insanely hot.  I haven't been this happy, though, since a year before my marriage ended, at least.  

In the end I just needed to put this into the world.  Of the thousands of emotions I'm dealing with through this, happiness and hope are the two strongest.  I hope that whatever the next days and weeks bring, that I can maintain the feeling of positivity that she's brought into my heart."
happy,"When I finally got up the courage to go to the dentist, I discovered that I needed an old crown replaced, 2 fillings, and, worst of all, 2 root canals. I am terrified of drilling and each time I had to go to an appointment over the past few months, I had to steel myself. However, this entire few years that I have gone without seeing a dentist, I knew that it was just a matter of time before I had a major problem, or even caused myself a serious health problem. It was like I had a shadow of worry always hanging over my shoulder, even in happy moments, and I knew the only way to dismiss it was to finally go to the dentist and let them fix every single problem.  

I had been saving up for a new car, so that money is all gone now, but I don’t need a new car the way I need the blissful peace of mind that comes with finally resolving a serious problem that has followed me for years.  

And actually, it ended up being not the worst case scenario. I didn’t lose a single tooth. I didn’t have to get any implants. If I do better at taking care of my teeth going forward, I hope I can keep all of them. And I hope I don’t ever have to do a root canal again. And my mouth feels so much better.  

edit to add: I just want to describe some things that happened during my first appointment. I was so terrified I was trembling violently. During the part where they were examining my teeth, with various sharp implements, every time it hurt so much, I would flinch violently. Tears began to stream from the corners of my eyes. Until finally the dentist said “Do you need a moment?” and I sat up and the tech fetched my water bottle from my backpack. All of this was in the FIRST appointment, and all they were trying to do was find what was wrong, and what needed to be fixed, and I was so afraid, and my injured teeth hurt SO much. It was, all of it, built upon old childhood trauma, drilling when I wasn’t really numb, an elderly dentist chasing me around the chair and then yelling at my mother not to bring me in again if I was too stupid to let him help me.   

Anyway. I somehow made it through. Perhaps that first appointment _was_ the worst. Worse even than the root canals. "
happy,I have schizophrenia. I was never happy until I had kids. My kid did a play and I thought her role was so cool. They did game of thrones with Disney princess. Called games of tiaras she was snow white mother of dragons every one died and she got the throne. I was so happy. My life suck at her age my got beat up everyday.my sister wanted to be a only child. My uncle beat my aunt my other uncle beat his kids. My sister was raped. My dad held me and family hostage at gun point. I doing better. 
happy,"So I came back from a long few days at this place and I forgot my phone, when I came back, my mom greeted me and she gave me my iPad. I was going back in all the stuff I had and all the games I was playing, but something I saw in particular made me cry tears of joy. My mom sent me messages in my iPad with pictures of her with my childhood toy with her at work, in the bed while she was sleeping, and sent me some texts wishing me the best, say8ng she loves me, and other stuff. I was crying tears of joy."
happy,Mum has been helping me orchestrate so she knows I'm coming back- I haven't seen my family since Christmas and I've especially missed my little sister so I decided instead of staying at uni for reading week I'm gonna go home and surprise her!
happy,"I am not a phone addict, but I always used to grab my phone and start doom-scrolling whenever I felt bored, which increased my screen time to somewhere around 5 hours. Deep down, I knew what I was doing was wrong and that I needed to quit, but I wasn't able to do so. Earlier this week, I read an article about phone addiction that mentioned a simple method. I decided to give it a shot in the hopes that it might at least aid me, and I am pleased to report that it worked. I won't claim I fully quit using my phone in a few days, but it did help me minimize my screen usage by about 65%.  "
happy,"Even tho it’s quite embarrassing I wanted to share this. This is Caesar my poodle puppy who is ready to greet me early every morning. This means I have to get up and out to walk him first thing, something that I COULD NOT and WOULD NOT ever do before I had him because of my agoraphobia. He has given me more independence and has made me progress so much faster. He even helps with my panic attacks. But most importantly I love him and he makes me happy!"

It went much better than the last times, I didn’t even think I  would start a fire, unlike the other times. I’m so proud of myself!"

happy,"We've been dating for a little over a month now and she just called me babe. No other petnames were used prior to this. I thought I honestly hate the word, and you know, maybe I still do, but it made me so insanely happy. She did use it in a joke so it might've been ironic but I do not care. I'm giggling and kicking my feet and even after sending a string of keyboard smashes and I love you's I'm giddy and need to tell somebody. Thanks for listening. I love her very much.
edit: I'm very disappointed in this community my replies explaining I'm in a poly relationship were downvoted for no reason. This sub is meant to be happy. And accepting. I changed the last sentence. Hope that makes your day better."
happy,"

My professor had embarrassed me in front of the whole class because I did not know one answer. He started asking me my name and throwing comments about how I don't know anything and all. He made me stand in front of everyone. Nevertheless, I, someone who's suffering from anxiety disorder and severe anxiety, someone who gets embarrassed so very easily, for the first time, did not get embarrassed. 

I was pretty chill tbh. I did not have a raised heartbeat, I did not feel extremely sad, I did not panic, I might have had a few tics but that's it. After he left, I just went about doing my job and honestly I was impressed with myself. Idk whether this happended because I have a bigger embarrassing situation/trauma to deal with such that this felt so small or because I was already tired of everyone's sh!t. 

It happened and I'm honestly kinda happy."
happy,"And, on top of that, we are both now throwing hard enough that the ball makes that wonderfully satisfying sound when hitting the glove.  Today is a good day."
happy,"With things as grim as they've been the last few years, I decided I'd get a bit of summer work last year while I was off uni so I could fund a long weekend on the seaside after, as well as a trip to Berlin I'm looking to do with my friends this summer. To cut a long story short, I got a job at uni working in the applicant call centre, where people who were meant to be joining this year could phone up and make enquiries.

A-level results day (I'm from the UK) rolls around and sure enough we get a load of people calling up who've not had the right grades for the course they wanted. Basically, the process is that we ask them for their grades, look up what other relevant courses they'd be eligible for, then forward them on to the department if there's space and they're interested. We have one option called a Foundation Year, where you only need a CDD or something like that to be eligible. You basically do a year of baseline work in your subject area to show that you're competent, then you can go on to do the course you originally wanted.

I took 90-something calls that day, and referred about ten or so people on for foundation years, along with a small handful of other people for other courses. I worked about 12 hours that day, and so I went for a pint afterwards to unwind. I remembered a couple of years prior when a friend of mine didn't get the grades he needed and had to call up the uni, so I've seen how hopeless people can feel when they have to do it. While I was drinking, I had this realisation that, thanks to my intervention, those people were able to still find a way into the uni they wanted to be at. I hadn't had a great past year at uni myself, and so I felt like I'd actually served a purpose that day for the first time in ages"
happy,"Might not seem like a big accomplishment to a lot of people, but as someone who’s been constantly biting their nails until they bleed since like 6 years old (I’m now 16), this is a big accomplishment for me!! 

I used to bite them a lot when I was nervous, after panic attacks or after breakdowns, but for the last two weeks I haven’t had any urges to! My nails are finally long enough that I can paint them and they’re also the longest they’ve been in years! 

They might not be super long but to me they are! I’m hoping to let them grow longer and learn to do more nail art and stuff with them!"

I can't change it. She's happy now, and that's all I wish for her. I'm at peace with the whole situation at last. I'm happy knowing she's happy, and that we can still be friends, even if we're not as close. 

I think of our memories fondly, and not in sadness. And I feel so much more free, it's always been in the back of my mind since it happened, and when I first thought of her today I just felt alright. Life will do what it will. I absolutely can't wait to make new friends"
happy,I've been exercising and training everyday. I reach one goal and improved on another. Every morning I do fourty sit ups. Now I get the fourty in but I have to usually do them I sets of ten or take a break. Today I did a complete set of fourty with no breaks all one set so I'm very happy about that. Also yesterday in my running I went further than usual and was less winded. I run in intervals so I was less winded in intervals. So I'm very happy about those things.
happy,"Basically the title but my mum recently bought us tickets to see Hozier when he comes to Australia and she’s now teaching herself the lyrics to all his songs so she can sing along, what makes this better is that English is not her first language and she keeps asking me what some words mean so she can fully understand what his songs are about."

happy,"After being rejected for an early admission, and direct admission, I still tried to appeal for a third time to get into the college course I wanted. I just got the results that I was SUCCESSFUL!!!!!! I'M SO HAPPY I'M CRYING I MADE IT I MADE IT. I had absolutely no hope for if i didn't get accepted and was considering giving up entirely"
happy,"So for the past 3 months I’ve been managing the little money I had since work stopped paying us but it wasn’t just my office apparently it was the whole country like everyone working under the government wasn’t getting paid or isn’t getting paid let me say it was just a week  ago my sister even said they paid them but other offices not yet. Eventually my money finished and I ended with things I needed to do but had no money and worst of all a few days ago my cousin kept bugging me about a money I owed her this really made me so worried because I hate owing people money and hate people thinking I’m deliberately refusing to pay them but I really didn’t have the money 

I even cried because it’s not like I could borrow from someone else to pay her because no one ever believes me when I say I’m broke they just think I want to get more money or they think she is from a rich family her parents definitely give her money whenever she wants. They don’t, my parents have never believed in giving their kids everything, I mean they give other peoples kids everything but not theirs so I guess everyone would think they treat us the same way but it’s not like that 

Anyways today my mom called and said hey I sent you some money and the first thing I said what do you need me to get for you or pay or who should I send it to because that usually it and she said no it’s for you. For a second I thought she was joking and I was like what did you say I should do with this money, and she said it’s for you. I was so happy I wanted to cry. So I asked can I really use this money and she goes yes. I don’t know how she knew I needed money so badly because I didn’t tell anyone but I guess she could tell since she is my mom and I love her so much. Though it didn’t solve all my problems it solved the one I was most worried about it. My mom didn’t need to send me the money but she did and I’m so grateful for that

Update: I got paid today finally 😊. Thanks for the sweet comments my mom really is a great mom. I feel like her sending me that money had something to do with me finally getting paid after 3 months. Maybe a coincidence or something I don’t know but I just want to believe that. Though I only got paid for one month it’s still better than nothing "
happy,"So, this was my first year applying to physical therapy school and I managed to get accepted everywhere I applied. I even have a soft offer for a paid research assistant position for work similar to what I did in undergrad!

I understand that PT school isn't the best financial decision for most people, but I did accept my offer at a relatively cheap school. Beyond that, I grew up with a single mom and my first paycheck will be more than she has ever made! It just feels like all the work is paying off and I am making progress towards my goals."
happy,"I know it's not a huge deal but after a lot of research and taking my time I successful did a full brake job on my vehicle. I've been driving it for a week now and it's been a smooth ride, great braking and just overall really happy that I was able to complete it. In a way it really built some significant confidence for myself. I usually just do my own oil changes so this was a big step forward."

happy,"2 years ago, my partner worked at Habitat for Humanity as a family coordinator, where she would help families apply, understand the criteria, and screen families for eligibility. There was a lovely immigrant family of 4, a mom, dad, teenage son, and younger daughter who were incredibly sweet and hardworking. The problem was that they applied 4 times, and each time, they either had just the smallest bit over income or they were not selected. My partner saw how hard working they were and how much this would turn their life around. They lived in a small 1 bedroom apartment and spending way too much on rent.  On the 5th application, my partner made sure that everything was correct, they were eligible, and she went to bat for them during committee selections, ensuring they got a house this time. They talked so often throughout the process and the mom called my partner her “daughter”, that is how close they became. Then one day, my partner gets home and tells me that this family got approved to get a new house after 2 years of rejections. I was floored with emotions as I had become so invested in their wellbeing. 

Now, my partner was the one that would be calling and letting the families know that they would be eligible to receive a home. I was so invested in this family that I made sure to listen to the phone call that she made to the mom of the family on speakerphone. As soon as she called, the mom thought something else was wrong and she didn’t get a home this round. Instead, my partner broke the news that they would be getting a house. That was when I immediately started balling my eyes out. I’m crying, my partner is crying, and the mom was crying.  It’s really hard to describe the amount of love the mom had for my partner and the gratitude she had for my partner doing everything she could to get them a home. I cried for a long time, even after they hung up. I’ve never felt so happy for someone else being so happy. To this day, when I think about that phone call, I tear up and could cry just like that day. I’ve never cried from happiness this way for anyone. As I write this, my eyes fill with tears thinking back to that beautiful moment. 

Later, the mom brought my partner a whole cake and other expressions of gratitude. It’s a moment that will stay with me for the rest of my life. Today, this family is thriving more than they ever have and we keep up with them. "
happy,Not to Jinx myself and I'm knocking on wood. But next week I've been at my job eleven years. It makes me happy because growing up I had learning issues and was in special Ed. And the teachers were not nice. I was told I would never go to college and ide never hold a job. I have so far done both. And I feel..well proud of myself in a way I've beaten odds and expectations. I was told i would be nothing but a failure.
happy,biased bur still heheh. I have a romantic partner an a queerplatonic partner and they are both just my entire world i love them so so so so much they make me feel so safe an happy and good i anm a bit looopy rn but i an justbso in loveee
happy,I went to the dentist and I’m scared of them but they let me listen to music so I listened to stuff from Bob’s Burgers (my special interest) and I wore my pink slippers and Bob’s Burgers shirt! I found my Phoebe Bridgers shirt again and I got candy since I couldn’t eat it before! My cavities on my front teeth are filled well the one is but I’m so happy I never thought I’d do it !!! I can’t stop smiling when I see a mirror just to look at my teeth!

happy,"I started an automotive apparel and parts brand back in 2012 as a “hobby”, just wanting to make some cool stuff for friends. A few years in, I took it on full time and I’ve been doing that ever since. It’s a lot of long days and sleepless nights but I finally achieved a goal I’ve been wanting since the beginning.

happy,"I just wanted to share it with somebody who can appreciate it. I am a young aspiring writer and I have never got actual recognition for it before. It's a small contest, but I am still incredibly overjoyed by it. It was a short story, but I mostly specialise in those anyway. It feels so awesome to have someone see my work and like it.
I'm not even excited about whatever my reward will be. I'm just happy someone read that little story and enjoyed it."
happy,"I (M25) remember deploying to the Middle East and staying up until 2-3am in the middle of the desert sleeping on a litter (the medical kind) watching the Matthew Stafford led Lions beat the Matt Ryan led Atlanta Falcons. I was also there when we traded for Jared Goff. My Marines (I was their corpsman “medic”) were from Southern California so I got a lot of grief, but nothing could tear me apart from my home team.

Years later, I remember my girlfriend breaking up with me. I got drunk and sad while I watched the Jared Goff led Lions beat the Matthew Stafford led Rams, winning their first playoff game for the first time in 32 years.

It sounds dumb how much a sports team could effect your mental health. But fuck man, I needed that shit so fuckin badly both times. I often think about the happiness that team gave me when I was at my lowest, shit gets me every time. 

I lived all across the country and had plenty of people just chirp in my ear about how I should just give up being a Lions fan and just join their fan base and I never did. There’s something special about facing adversity or how ____ and ____ isn’t good enough and coming back on the other side better, showing them they were wrong. I think we can all relate to that in some level. You can say it’s dumb, it is a little… but that made me happy and that’s all I need.

I'm definitely going to pay him back though, because I would feel bad if I didn't. Besides, it's the right thing to do. He just deserves the world. Of course, I told him that he didn't have to since it's just a game i could get dor the regular price next month, but he insisted so much, because he knew how much I liked the game from watching him play it during shareplay.

happy,"Today is the day my life will change FOREVER!!!!

Even as a welder, the most I have ever made doing back breaking work was $20.60 an hour. I currently make $18.22 an hour as a lead IT processing technician. Since 2021, I have been going to school for an A.A.S in multimedia/web development. I joined this company in 2022 and worked up to a lead IT processing technician. And today I was just offered a software developer job for $50,000 a year.

I wont lie, yes, I worked INCREDIBLY hard. I am in the honors society as the VP of communications and public relations for our school chapter. I have maintained a 4.0 GPA (I am graduating in May, I have 2 classes left that I am currently taking) and am so close to graduating with highest honors in my community college. I won an award last year in our state that only 55 students out of 200,000+ community college students called the All-State Academic Team and won a scholarship for Women in STEM. I am a very ambitious and have strived so much through this

BUT, I would have not had this job opportunity if I didn't have luck on my side. Working at this company, I found out they have a software developer team, and did my best to network with them and the adjacent IT team since I started. I had people who I made friends with who spoke my name when the software developer team asked about possible internal candidates. Just like it was luck for them that they actually had an internal employee who lives close enough to their facility who just happens to be going to school for web development, I just so happen to be lucky to work at a place where I could even move up like this.

There were 192 candidates, some of them being other internal employees. And I got it. me. I can't believe this.

I WANT TO CELEBRATE AND SCREAM TO THE ROOFTOPS"
happy,"I'm celebrating my 21st at Disney with my momma and we've been many times since I was 6 years old. Because I'm chronically online, I would call her immature, lazy, boot licking capitalist because this is the only place I've been on vacation. She just told me this will probably be our last trip together since I'm getting older and graduating soon. I started crying uncontrollably because I realized this is our happy place. This is OUR special place we make memories. I'm constantly surrounding myself around miserable people because of my mental health conditions alongside me being queer. There is beauty in traditions and my momma loves me so much and more than anything in the world."
happy,"ljust need to let this out to some one but I'm finally happy in a relationship, my last one was exhausting and it was to the point that my new S/0 was confused why was so happy when she came into the store with me. I also almost cried when the first time I was at work and she stayed at my place she had cleaned the entire place just cuz, no one has ever done that and it ment so much to me,It just feels like such a great weight off my shoulders and made me feel something I've never felt before. I can't wait to take her on her first vacay in Sept to show how much she means to me and to spend time with he in Disney. 

Also wanted to let people know that love is out there, if this woman can love a 23 year old autistic guy with 10k in Legos, then there is hope for everyone out there."
happy,"I hope he was talking about post-serum! 

But in all seriousness, made my day. When kids are nice, it just seems so genuine. Same kid also asked me if I was a D1 basketball player while I was shooting around (I’m not even close!)

Anyway, it just made me happy."
happy,So what small things brings you joy or makes you happy? 
happy,"I just got back from a trip to Idaho for my nieces high school graduation. I had casually kept a good relationship over text with my niece ever since she moved from Southern California to Texas to Idaho in less than a few months. I knew she was going through a lot emotionally and with college coming up it was stressful. I remember how I was at that age (I graduated 2003 and also switched high schools my sr year).

Come graduation day we're in the gymnasium and all the families are still kinda getting seated. I can see all the chairs for the seniors to sit on, I see all the administration on stage and the band in the back playing some songs. Then I see some of her family on her moms side get super excited and I look down to my right to see what the commotion's about. It's a sash that said ""Valedictorian"".

What?! Not only was my niece Valedictorian of her class, she absolutely CRUSHED it. She's already a full year ahead into her college coursework, passed every AP exam she took, played Bass Clarinet through school, did Softball and went to State Championships. She's like a superhuman.

I don't have any kids of my own, but the amount of pride I feel for her is immense. To top it all off she got a full ride to the University of Idaho and she plans on studying Neuroscience (you know, easy stuff). And she's still highly critical of herself and self analyses a ton looking for any way to be better in almost anything she does. The coolest thing I ever did was play video games professionally on a stage - this girl's about to solve complex brain problems as a hobby.

As a reward for all her hard work I made her a promise - a thing I never do because I hate making promises as I hate even the idea of not being able to keep one. I promised her if she graduated with a 4 year degree (not even necessarily in neuroscience, I gave her that leeway) that I'd personally pay for and accompany her on a trip to Japan. And since she's worked so hard in high school she's already got a year head start. I now have 3 years to save up for a Japan trip. Worst Best promise ever."
happy,"So after a few more dates she finally kissed me, she said she didn’t want to fall in love with me I do not know how to take it but she kissed me  all yesterday she even held my hand"

happy,I live in Florida so pretty soon it’ll be too hot to spend entire days out here so we enjoy it when we can!!
happy,"I’ve been in for four years, four years since I was seventeen. It’s been an experience and I’m so glad that I can go back home and see my family, my friends, travel more freely, attend university. I’ve never been more satisfied with my position now that this chapter of my life is finally coming to a close."
happy,"In the first picture 140lbs, Second picture 216lbs. 6’4 btw."
happy,"When we were kids, our immediate family was pretty low-income. So when we were visiting, our grandpa would often take a few of the grandkids to “grab coffee” from a well known donut shop. We’d get there and he’d say to the employees, “A black coffee and a whatever these guys want.” 

My brother and I would have mere seconds to select a single donut from the wall of deliciousness, and I often would feel overwhelmed with choice in the moment. We loved going to “grab coffee” with grandpa. 

Fast-forward about 25 years or so, and my brother and I live far from our hometown in different states. I text him and he absolutely remembered getting donuts with Grandpa, so with a bit of planning, we roped a friend of mine in who still lives in the old stomping grounds. 

This morning, I called my grandpa, then added my brother to the call. Grandpa is 87, and had to put us on speakerphone because one of his hearing aids needed to be charged. We chat to him for a moment, then my friend (and his mom, who used to go to church with my grandpa) rolls up with a box of donuts and a black coffee. 

Grandpa was surprised and a little confused at first, but was delighted that we remembered his coffee after all these years. Then he hung up on us (most of his phone calls don’t last more than 60 seconds) so he could chat to my friend and his mom. 

Honestly, it was such a delight to organize something unexpected for such a generous and caring gentleman who had such an impact on me and my brother. 

TL/DR grandpa used to take us to get donuts so we had donuts delivered to him even though we live far away."
happy,"I just got the best news!!!

After months of waiting, many tests, background checks and a fun 4 hour long psych eval with even more tests involved…

I got offered a job as a County Detention Deputy!!!!

It’s almost double the yearly salary I have been getting for the last few years!

This is fantastic news!!!!"
happy,"I know this sounds silly. 

But my friend is going through a bad divorce. He's been abused for 30 years by a wack job. He got kicked out of his place, and I offered my couch. 

We're sitting on my bed, watching a movie, and high. He has had a terrible day, so I'm trying to make it better. I noticed he took a picture of a gift I got him and posted it to a Reddit sub. 

I asked what he was doing, and he got so excited. He told me he was in this nice sub and everyone is so welcoming, that his post got 700 karma. He is very, very new to this app and is older, so he's not up to snuff with everything. 

But he just lit up when he showed me how excited he was that people were talking to him and that they liked his post so much that he got ""a little karma"" 

This man has cried his eyes out for hours tonight; seeing him beam about something so small just filled my heart. I'm overjoyed to see him this excited! 

Anyway, I just, really want this man to be happy, so for this small thing to really bring him joy just makes my chest burn.

Edit: 

If you all want to give him some love I'll link his art post. It'll make him very excited that people enjoy his art. He only ever shares it within his work space. Not sure why but I think it'll get him excited.

happy,"Five years ago I didn't see a future for myself at all. I was sleeping in my rideshare rental car, was in a crappy part time job that I hated, and was living with severe anxiety. Sixteen months ago, I took a chance and decided to give school another try. Thanks to financial aid and scholarships, tuition assistance from my current job, and support from a lot of people around me, I now have an AA in Political Science and graduated Phi Theta Kappa with honors. I have gotten offers from several schools to transfer/finish my BA, including some really good schools (one is an Ivy League school). I've wanted to move to the East Coast (NYC area) since I was 15 and finally have the opportunity at the end of this year, and will be finishing my BA there. My dream is to become a history teacher; history is AWESOME because it helps us to learn about so many facets of society and humanity, and education is a very noble, yet very under-appreciated field that I wish more people would look into. Learning is magical, and as long as we are alive, we have a chance to learn something new."

I’m going to see some BEAUTIFUL places, learn fascinating history, drink, laugh, meet new people, and I can hardly wait. 

I’ve been through a pretty wild ride the last several years and I just feel like I am in a really good place. I have good friends, good family, a job I love that pays the bills, and I am able to do things like get a Disneyland pass and travel to new places.

happy,"Even in the middle of the storm, there are small places to breath"
happy,"When I finally got up the courage to go to the dentist, I discovered that I needed an old crown replaced, 2 fillings, and, worst of all, 2 root canals. I am terrified of drilling and each time I had to go to an appointment over the past few months, I had to steel myself. However, this entire few years that I have gone without seeing a dentist, I knew that it was just a matter of time before I had a major problem, or even caused myself a serious health problem. It was like I had a shadow of worry always hanging over my shoulder, even in happy moments, and I knew the only way to dismiss it was to finally go to the dentist and let them fix every single problem.  

I had been saving up for a new car, so that money is all gone now, but I don’t need a new car the way I need the blissful peace of mind that comes with finally resolving a serious problem that has followed me for years.  

And actually, it ended up being not the worst case scenario. I didn’t lose a single tooth. I didn’t have to get any implants. If I do better at taking care of my teeth going forward, I hope I can keep all of them. And I hope I don’t ever have to do a root canal again. And my mouth feels so much better.  

edit to add: I just want to describe some things that happened during my first appointment. I was so terrified I was trembling violently. During the part where they were examining my teeth, with various sharp implements, every time it hurt so much, I would flinch violently. Tears began to stream from the corners of my eyes. Until finally the dentist said “Do you need a moment?” and I sat up and the tech fetched my water bottle from my backpack. All of this was in the FIRST appointment, and all they were trying to do was find what was wrong, and what needed to be fixed, and I was so afraid, and my injured teeth hurt SO much. It was, all of it, built upon old childhood trauma, drilling when I wasn’t really numb, an elderly dentist chasing me around the chair and then yelling at my mother not to bring me in again if I was too stupid to let him help me.   

Anyway. I somehow made it through. Perhaps that first appointment _was_ the worst. Worse even than the root canals. "
happy,"I'm celebrating today!
I found out a lot about myself during this year because of reddit and people here.

thank you all, folks!"
happy,"For 24 years I've worked to grow my business.  As a single parent it has been tough.  I missed many precious moments with my daughter and I've always regretted it.  My company has been my second greatest accomplishment next to my daughter.  I'm truly happy to sell it today because I'm selling it to the employees who have done so much to make it great.

I never thought this day would come and it's been an emotional rollercoaster for the last four years. I feared what retirement would mean.  I had an identity crisis coming to terms with not being the boss.  I feared boredom but the pandemic has taught me that I don't need my business.  Connection to my family and hobbies are more than enough to provide fulfillment.

I had a hard time with selling, I built this company and it's a reflection of me.  I've had plenty of offers from larger firms but I don't want to think what would have happened to my company, my employees and it's reputation if some huge conglomerate absorbed it.

It's taken years and I am not getting as much as I could if I sold to a competitor but I'm selling to people who I know will continue the company with the same standards I built it with.  I'm selling to the employees who are the ones that made it all possible. I also know I'm the only one who will be out of a job from this.

It took 4 years to let go and today I finally signed. In a few more months I'll walk away, happily. I have many years left to spend with my family, travel, enjoy my farm, and my horses. I'm truly thankful for the last 24 years and everyone who has made this moment possible.
"
happy,"So for the past 3 months I’ve been managing the little money I had since work stopped paying us but it wasn’t just my office apparently it was the whole country like everyone working under the government wasn’t getting paid or isn’t getting paid let me say it was just a week  ago my sister even said they paid them but other offices not yet. Eventually my money finished and I ended with things I needed to do but had no money and worst of all a few days ago my cousin kept bugging me about a money I owed her this really made me so worried because I hate owing people money and hate people thinking I’m deliberately refusing to pay them but I really didn’t have the money 

I even cried because it’s not like I could borrow from someone else to pay her because no one ever believes me when I say I’m broke they just think I want to get more money or they think she is from a rich family her parents definitely give her money whenever she wants. They don’t, my parents have never believed in giving their kids everything, I mean they give other peoples kids everything but not theirs so I guess everyone would think they treat us the same way but it’s not like that 

Anyways today my mom called and said hey I sent you some money and the first thing I said what do you need me to get for you or pay or who should I send it to because that usually it and she said no it’s for you. For a second I thought she was joking and I was like what did you say I should do with this money, and she said it’s for you. I was so happy I wanted to cry. So I asked can I really use this money and she goes yes. I don’t know how she knew I needed money so badly because I didn’t tell anyone but I guess she could tell since she is my mom and I love her so much. Though it didn’t solve all my problems it solved the one I was most worried about it. My mom didn’t need to send me the money but she did and I’m so grateful for that

Update: I got paid today finally 😊. Thanks for the sweet comments my mom really is a great mom. I feel like her sending me that money had something to do with me finally getting paid after 3 months. Maybe a coincidence or something I don’t know but I just want to believe that. Though I only got paid for one month it’s still better than nothing "
happy,She's old enough to follow along and we played a cupcake gathering boardgame. I grew up playing lots of games and I'm just so psyched about more! We followed about 90% of the rules and we had a blast!
happy,"I probably found a friend for life

We know eachother for 6 years, even though we didn't meet irl as he's to far from my city, we trust eachother more than anyone we have. He saved me from un-aliving myself multiple times and he didn't even know about it. Tonight we were just talking, he went into a topic of my mental health and then we both thanked eachother for helping ourselves. I'm glad he exists and if I didn't play that one league game I wouldn't be here right now.


Edit: Did I?
"
happy," I've been the happiest I've been for at least the past five years. No real complaints, no real worries. I mean, little day to day things like in a sitcom, but nothing crazy. I get up not worried about hating my job, don't think I have any real enemies, have a wonderful family and have the means to take care of them. Not religious either, so this is not fueled by my love for a higher being.

I found what makes me happy and don't really need anything else. Delighted to share my positive vibes if anyone needs some."

happy,"I (31F) dropped out of school more times than I can remember I finished undergrad last year and found a master program that was tailored to exactly what I want to a T. I applied to this school twice in undergrad and got rejected. This has been the school of my dreams since I was a child, I grew up around it, supported the teams since I was a kid and always drove by it wanted to go to it. I got the acceptance letter today and started crying. Everything that has happened to me has lead to this point.

I've been in a really good mood lately.

And recently I've somehow (through no real effort on my part) managed to become surrounded by very thoughtful, kind, and genuine people.

I've felt more at ease with my life in general.

It almost feels like my world turned around on it's own, and it brought a lot of joy into my life."

He tells me I’m the best mother he’s ever seen, that I deserve my own and that he desperately wants it too. Our kids ask us constantly when we’re going to have a baby. Hopefully we can answer that soon.

Now, by a chance opportunity, I started a new job alongside my studies for a company in an industry that I love to death (it’s a type of sports).

This time last year I was lower than I've been. I remember having to pull my car over because I was crying so hard I couldn't see. I remember sitting with my loaded gun and the only thing that stopped me is kids often go to the park I was in. I remember trying to wreck into a semi after a particularly bad day. For years I was so depressed and so low I never imagined things could be this good. 

But now I wake up everyday overjoyed. I go to work and even though it's work I love it. I shower and I don't sit and cry. I ride with my windows down and sing along to my music and thank my God that I'm alive to see today. That I didn't opt out before I turned 18 like I thought I would. That I made it to 22 like I didn't believe I could. That I wake up today at 25 happier than I've ever been my entire life. I smile and I laugh and I love and I took control of what made my life so awful and kicked its ass until I had full control. 

I think back on all those years I spent unhappy and hating myself and harming myself and I wish I could talk to old me and tell her that it does get better. It takes a long time and alot of shit but you come out on top. 

25 is so young and my life is so full now and I just wanted someone to know. I'm just happy and that's all I've ever wanted and all I'll ever want. I'm just happy to be happy yall"
happy,"I was just sitting on the couch today doing some work and for the first time, my cat actually jumped up on the coach and sat in my lap. I literally almost cried guys I will not lie 😭

she's usually pretty senile so it was just really surprising. gave her a bunch of treats after that lol she's a choker rn"
happy,I have been wanting to start a landscaping business for awhile now. The weather just started to turn the corner so I am going to go door to door after work today to see if I can get a little lawn care route going! I'm so exci
happy,"I'm a 30yr old woman and I've never really played with Legos before. My husband is an avid Lego lover, both as a kid and as an adult, and has recently wanted to get back into building them. 

I know there have been some really cool sets to come out in the past couple of years (some look like flowers or little zen gardens or insects one might pin, etc) so when he got himself a set today I also looked. I found this darling little bonsai tree and he offered to get it for me so we could build together! 

We both put ours together tonight and it was so much fun! I didn't realize that the cherry blossoms were actually little pink frogs until I got to that section. My little bonsai is chilling with its adorable little pink frogs on my counter and I could not be more pleased!

And for anyone wondering, hubby got himself the Thanos glove and he is pleased as punch! 😊"
happy,"Edgar (the raven) and Wartholomew (the frog) are Halloween decorations that I've had for a long while and dress in different costumes throughout the year (ex. holidays). They sit in our living room window facing the street.

I've had Edgar since 2020 & Wart since Summer 2023. I dress them in pet costumes (usually for cats or smaller pets like rodents/lizards) since they normally fit the best. 😀

Hope you guys like this! 😊"
happy,"We sat and talked for 6 hours yesterday and she said a lot of sweet things to me; like saying I was one of the best things to happen to her (I said that one first; she just said it back). I wish I wrote down the rest of them because I already forgot most of it (my memory is so bad and my life is so dramatically different than it was 3 months ago; new huge things are happening every week; last night I just got the keys to a house on the beach in Venice). There was one thing she said which did stick out, though:

""You're my type: extraordinary.""

No one has ever come close to making me that happy with less than 6 words.

Anyway, I'm about to make one of the biggest pivots of my life. I got an offer to leave the US and move to Switzerland\* and possibly Germany for a bit, so I'm working to change every last piece of me that has been holding me back. I don't know what I will resemble at the end of this, but I know, to at least one person, one of the most amazing people I've ever met, they found me extraordinary at one point in my life.

I honestly don't know that I could ask for a better compliment.

Anyway.

To future me, if you end up reading this, and you're feeling down, you were extraordinary to one of the most amazing people you ever met. That should not ever not matter to you.

\* it was somehow endearing how upset she got over this; I hate hurting her, even if it was inadvertent, but seeing her very upset texts burst through as I'm ""reviving"" my dead phone from an eventful night, was so \*damn\* heart-warming."
happy,"When we were kids, our immediate family was pretty low-income. So when we were visiting, our grandpa would often take a few of the grandkids to “grab coffee” from a well known donut shop. We’d get there and he’d say to the employees, “A black coffee and a whatever these guys want.” 

My brother and I would have mere seconds to select a single donut from the wall of deliciousness, and I often would feel overwhelmed with choice in the moment. We loved going to “grab coffee” with grandpa. 

Fast-forward about 25 years or so, and my brother and I live far from our hometown in different states. I text him and he absolutely remembered getting donuts with Grandpa, so with a bit of planning, we roped a friend of mine in who still lives in the old stomping grounds. 

This morning, I called my grandpa, then added my brother to the call. Grandpa is 87, and had to put us on speakerphone because one of his hearing aids needed to be charged. We chat to him for a moment, then my friend (and his mom, who used to go to church with my grandpa) rolls up with a box of donuts and a black coffee. 

Grandpa was surprised and a little confused at first, but was delighted that we remembered his coffee after all these years. Then he hung up on us (most of his phone calls don’t last more than 60 seconds) so he could chat to my friend and his mom. 

Honestly, it was such a delight to organize something unexpected for such a generous and caring gentleman who had such an impact on me and my brother. 

TL/DR grandpa used to take us to get donuts so we had donuts delivered to him even though we live far away."
happy,"I have always worked construction and trades jobs my whole life but a few years ago I took a leap and decided to do something with my creative side. It has always been my dream to work in a creative field as I’ve always loved art and design. So I’ve been going to university for graphic design for the past two years online. I’ve been working meaningless part time jobs in retail and maintenance to pay my bills while going to school. 

A little while ago my friend gave me a tip that his company was hiring and it’s in the industry. Long story short I beat the other applicants and was hired!!! I am now a layout editor for a media company. I specialize in newspaper page layouts. For the first time in my life I’m actually making a living wage and can afford to live normally. Nothing fancy but I’m doing more than just surviving now. I couldn’t be happier. Follow your dreams kids!!"
happy,"It's been some time since we have time to go out on our own, she realized that the zoo give her a free ticket fkr her b-day, so we said ""why not?"""
happy,"So for the past 3 months I’ve been managing the little money I had since work stopped paying us but it wasn’t just my office apparently it was the whole country like everyone working under the government wasn’t getting paid or isn’t getting paid let me say it was just a week  ago my sister even said they paid them but other offices not yet. Eventually my money finished and I ended with things I needed to do but had no money and worst of all a few days ago my cousin kept bugging me about a money I owed her this really made me so worried because I hate owing people money and hate people thinking I’m deliberately refusing to pay them but I really didn’t have the money 

I even cried because it’s not like I could borrow from someone else to pay her because no one ever believes me when I say I’m broke they just think I want to get more money or they think she is from a rich family her parents definitely give her money whenever she wants. They don’t, my parents have never believed in giving their kids everything, I mean they give other peoples kids everything but not theirs so I guess everyone would think they treat us the same way but it’s not like that 

Anyways today my mom called and said hey I sent you some money and the first thing I said what do you need me to get for you or pay or who should I send it to because that usually it and she said no it’s for you. For a second I thought she was joking and I was like what did you say I should do with this money, and she said it’s for you. I was so happy I wanted to cry. So I asked can I really use this money and she goes yes. I don’t know how she knew I needed money so badly because I didn’t tell anyone but I guess she could tell since she is my mom and I love her so much. Though it didn’t solve all my problems it solved the one I was most worried about it. My mom didn’t need to send me the money but she did and I’m so grateful for that

Update: I got paid today finally 😊. Thanks for the sweet comments my mom really is a great mom. I feel like her sending me that money had something to do with me finally getting paid after 3 months. Maybe a coincidence or something I don’t know but I just want to believe that. Though I only got paid for one month it’s still better than nothing "
happy,"hi- new-ish to reddit but just wanted to say that i’m happy with where i am in life right now. from last august-the end of the year i had no job and bills were draining my savings. 
after spending so much during the holidays, i NEEDED to get a job after the new year. it became my unspoken resolution. so after my guests left, i started applying. 
now, here I am, a SOLID paycheck in. PLUS i’m supporting a super cool small business!
i can’t wait to start saving up again. last year was rough. 
cheers! stay happy!"

happy,Recently I've been looking for a new drill and I went to a hardware store and saw all of the drills where 100-200 bucks! So I decided to travel to (generic value store) and got a hammer drill for 25 dollars! it works amazing and has 2 modes and I'm really happy about it! ( I left the store name out of this because I don't want this to sound like a promoting a company )
happy,"First of all, English isn't my first language so please understand. 

I come from a country and a community where dating culture isn't very big. Me and my brother have a 8 year age gap (he's younger). As a result, we don't relate to the same stuff, share similar likes/dislikes or even talk a lot about our personal lives or choices. Although I find a friend in him and he's been protective, caring; he barely talks about his friends, or problems, etc. 

But today! Oh boy, I'm still smiling ear to ear!
Today he called me out of the blue( lives in a different city) and asked me for an outfit suggestion because he was going to go meet this girl he has had a crush on. That alone, made me so happy! In that moment, I knew he found me helpful, I knew he trusted me with that as probably my parents would not approve of him skipping classes to go meet her, and I was happy that he came to me when he felt like he was stuck.
I gave him a suggestion, appropriate for a first date (of his life) and he left. I was fine, happy that he was happy. It was just a little meet at a cafe at evening, they decided to have some snacks, talk etc and head back their own ways.

Fast forward three hours, HE CALLED me.. n he told me how great the date was!! I NEVER expected he'd call and share that with me! N he was so giggly (I don't know if that's even a word, sorry) and chirpy and happy and nervous and so much more lol! He told me, that she looked so beautiful this evening, that he couldn't utter a word. So he scrolled through Instagram, luckily came across a picture of  beautifully arranged flowers and he sent that post to her with a message that said - ""you look this beautiful today"". My little brother, ladies and gentlemen!! He's 19. 19!!! We never have seen anyone go on a date except in movies and stuff ig. And this guy was like 5yo just a couple years ago 🥺🥺When did he grow up so fast! 

N to top all that, he thanked me - he THANKED ME for helping him know how to treat a girl right! He thinks I'm nice. He trusts me. He ACTUALLY looks up to me!!🥺
I. Am. Melting! 
I'm happy a ton! Sorry if this is too long. To the ones who stuck till the end, you people are my angels. I just wanted to share this. ❤️

happy,"Not only was I drinking out of despair for my unfortunate life, but I was making my life more unfortunate with drinking. I was depressed. Couldn’t hold a job. Was in debt. Unhealthy life habits and terribly unhealthy, both physically and mentally. Had toxic friendships and relationships. Deep down I hated myself and thought it was the life I deserved, and I couldn’t ever live a happy life. 9 months ago I decided to change that. My whole life has turned around! I’ve lost weight, am finally experiencing true happiness, have a wonderful partner and meaningful relationships, am constantly working on making my self and life better, and may even be able to retire before I hit 30.  Oh, and I am nearly 3 months sober of weed as well!!!!

Today is such a good day. "

1.) pray to God
2.) taking my meds as prescribed 
3.) cutting weed and alcohol out of my life

happy,"My mom has been a green thumb enthusiasts. Her garden is a beautiful mess with half edibles and flowers and it's a little slice of her happy place.


But she has always been strictly a roses, carnations and dahlias only gardener with the odd daisy, marigold or iris thrown in. Wildflowers to her were the equivalent of weeds (lol).


A few weeks ago, I had been feeling down and I saw a video of a wildflower meadow that looked stunning. I mentioned to my mum about how happy they made me due to the bright colors, the bees and butterflies it attracted. That's it, that's all I said. She nodded and didn't say much. 


Well this morning I saw the tall grassy patch she had left to 'recover and compost' before she planted veg in had wildflowers. 


She seeded the bare patch for me without asking. Just because it made me happy. It made me feel so loved in that moment. Mom cares. She heard and saw what I was feeling and decided to build me a small wildflower patch so I could sit outside and escape my depression.


After years of a rocky relationship, we are finally building a solid foundation with wildflowers."
happy,"My birthday was the 27th and I received money for letting me buy supplies to try sculpting for the first time. I went to Micheal’s and got everything I needed! The wonderful cashier gave me a discount and I was able to add a few more things I’d been eyeing! 

I drew ideas for figurines ages ago and I finally get to turn one of them into a reality!! This is my progress so far! I’ve never sculpted clay before but I have done some models on ZBrush and watched a few tutorials on working the clay, so I had an idea of how things were going to go. I’m doing piece by piece and then putting them all together at the end. I plan to paint and varnish it as well!! 

I’ve had a lot of fun so far and I’m really excited to finish it!!"
happy,"I never thought giving a gift would make me so happy. I live in India and my best friend always had this big desire to visit a special place for worshipping Krishna. Unfortunately, that place is very far away. But then I found out there is a similar place much closer to where we live, so I decided to take her there as a surprise.

I didn't tell her where I intended to take her. I just asked her when she had her holidays and around christmas we planned the trip. It took 4 hours to reach there and when we were just about to reach I gave her a note saying 'We will visit your favourite place one day soon. Until that time enjoy this little surprise from me'. When we were at front gate and she realized where we were she became so mesmerised. Seeing her so happy I felt very gratified. That was the first time I realized that love is about giving cause the more you give the more blissful you become.

We visited every temple, the people were chanting Hare Krishna and she was enjoying every little thing. She even took some of the soil from there as a memory. Seeing that she loved my surprise there was different level of joy within me and I truly felt what Sadhguru says 'How deeply you touch another life is how rich your life is'."
happy,"I was infantry, and I used to feel a certain amount a guilt having never killed.  Think of it as survivors guilt in a way, of others have to carry that burden what makes me so special?  But the older I get, the more I’m just all around glad and relieved.  We all think we will be fine when we join, but as you mature you realize there’s no telling how you’ll react.  I can finally, at least for today, say I’m perfectly fine having never been in that situation.  Some may look down on this, but kiss my ass after Taco Bell "

happy,"I've been playing as a non-singing guitarist
in rock bands for a long time and finally started taking singing lessons 2 months ago to boost my confidence.

My wife has heard me sing plenty at home in private and has always given that supportive, but vague, ""yah, you sound OK"" response.

My instructor said I really had to own and believe in the lyrics of the songs I sing, so l've been working on singing with more feeling and expression.

We've been together for more than 30 years and I'm still crazy about her.

This morning I was hugging my wife, and while looking in her eyes, I started singing her the Beatles version of ""Til There Was You""...and she got quiet with watery eyes and a beet red face!  Then we burst out laughing.

My voice may not be perfect and I may be an old, but maybe I still got it!😻"

happy,"I am not a phone addict, but I always used to grab my phone and start doom-scrolling whenever I felt bored, which increased my screen time to somewhere around 5 hours. Deep down, I knew what I was doing was wrong and that I needed to quit, but I wasn't able to do so. Earlier this week, I read an article about phone addiction that mentioned a simple method. I decided to give it a shot in the hopes that it might at least aid me, and I am pleased to report that it worked. I won't claim I fully quit using my phone in a few days, but it did help me minimize my screen usage by about 65%.  "

happy,"I paid off my house today and I am 100% debt free!

For context on this, my finances got really messed up by a combination of the great recession and my husband passing away in 2007-2008.I started with almost nothing except for my kids and my job skills. I slowly rebuilt my life and finances step-by-step.

I had a low interest rate, but I wanted to pay off my home loan since retirement is not too far away. I have a few more years to top off my savings then I can pull the plug on my career.

I set a goal for myself to pay off my house and this morning I called the bank and did it. So happy that this long stretch of frugality finally paid off!"

happy,"Yesterdays workout turned into a slightly longer session than planned. I bought myself a luxurious licorice pipe (not the usual (Swedes knows which one I mean) , but an unknown, more expensive fancy variant!) and planned to treat myself after the session if I did well. The session felt... meh. I go to the reception to return a belly belt I borrowed for maxing out on the leg press, and then I see a guy yelling and causing a scene because his gym card is canceled for some reason. He's loud and creating an aggressive atmosphere. The receptionist is young and thin (less than 50kg), looking very uncomfortable. She has called the police. I try to talk to him.

- If you can't get in, and she only sees that it's blocked, and asks you to contact customer service, then there's nothing more to do. It's not her fault that your gym card is blocked.

But he talks about how badly he's being treated and tries to turn it into a racist thing.

- Call the police, do it! I'm not leaving this place!

And that I'm on the wrong side of what's right and wrong in the world.

- I swear to God! Jalla!

He gets up on a chair and starts waving and screaming even more. I tell him that when he's threatening and aggressive, it's not okay. It's still not her fault. If she asks you to leave, you have to leave. She's the one in charge here.

But he refuses to listen and just keeps rambling about... I don't really know what. That if it were the other way around, he wouldn't be treated this way, and blah blah blah. I wasn't on the HUMAN side, but on the INHUMAN side!

Mkay. Sure, but now she's asking you to leave. She can't do anything about it. He tries to call customer service, but as they don't answer at this time, he gets upset about how unfair it is. Gets up on the chair again, screaming and waving, hitting the lights above him, causing them to flicker. After maybe twenty long minutes of meaningless ranting, three police officers finally come and remove him, and talks to the receptionist.

I go back and stretch a bit. After a while, she comes by, and I see that she is upset and close to tears. First, she apologizes for what happened; it's not something I should have to endure. But she was glad that I was there and handled the situation. I say no worries, it was obvious I had to do something. And SHE shouldn't have to endure this at work. 

I go shower and sauna, and when I'm done and on my way going through the gym to the entrance, I see her again, and ask if she likes licorice. 

-Yes, she answers curiously. I offer her my luxury licorice pipe. She is surprised and wonders if I don't want it for myself. I say it would have been my reward if I had a good session, but it was meh. And, I think she should have something good happening today. She thanked me and said it made her very happy! And that made me happy too, despite the bad session. Win-win! "
happy,"A few years ago when I was in Year 13 (last year of high school in the UK) my form tutor didn't show up one day and it turned out she was having a family bereavement. She was very well liked and her family was all the way in New Zealand so it felt like we could hardly just do nothing.

I stepped up to the plate and bought a card, and somehow got it around the whole form class, plus a few people in the media class she took in our year as I recall, over the course of a few days without her knowing. The message I wrote in the card was ""don't be sad it's over, be glad it happened"", which was what I lived by when my Grandma died a couple of years later in 2022. 

The day comes to give it to her, and it turns out a few girls in the class have also bought her a box of chocolates, even better right? They hand her the chocolates, and I make my friend hand her the card because of my social anxiety. We thought she'd appreciate it, but we got more than we bargained for. She's clearly holding back tears and starts talking about how loved she felt and how lucky she was to be our form tutor.

This was during the few months of COVID where schools were open in the UK, so things were obviously really grim at the time. She was a really sweet, positive, glass half full person to be around and so form class with her was really the only thing keeping a lot of us going. Not only did the gifts have a good impact on her, but it felt like we'd paid her back a little as well."
happy,"There isn’t much that brings me pleasure anymore but i am so grateful for warm blankets. I just put a blanket in the drier until it was warmed up, i took it out and laid under it for a few seconds and it was one of the most pleasurable things I have ever felt in my life. I just felt so safe, so comforted and loved and even though i was completely alone i didn’t feel like it at all. All of the tension in my body just completely went away and breathing became so easy, my lungs felt so open and every time i breathed i could feel my breath traveling throughout my whole body. The pleasurable sensation that started in my chest began to expand, until it expanded to the blanket itself. I didn’t even feel like a separate entity anymore, nothing was separate, all that exists is warmth, and every aspect of my surroundings including myself is a part of the Great Warmness. I was so affectionate i started smiling so intensely and i felt so happy i started crying in the middle of nowhere. It was beautiful. Why is a heated piece of cloth capable of this?? Even though it only lasts a few seconds, it makes everything around me seem perfect and it makes everything seem okay. It’s the only friend i have. I love the warmth of heated blankets so much and i am so thankful for its sweet embrace, i don’t deserve it at all"
happy,"I know it’s probably not a crazy good accomplishment; especially because I know I’ve hurt people before, but I’m still proud of myself nonetheless. 

I used to be defensive, snappy, and easy to push into sadness or anger. This was due some previous life experiences. Which doesn’t make it okay. It never does, but I feel like me getting better and being a better friend and person to those around me is a sign that I’m moving on from that. I’m healing. :)

I’ve been in and out of therapy my whole life; which never really worked until I became an adult and was able to truly think for myself and be myself. 
Now; after two years of panic attacks and mental decline, I think I’m finally getting better. I’m kinder, I’m more generous, I’m able to take criticism. I’m still sensitive, but I try to remember the intention of others before reacting in anyway. I’ve also learned to take time for myself incase my emotions get too high. (Something I was INCAPABLE of doing before) 

Okay, sorry for the wall of text; I’m just happy to be doing better. Thank you, if you made it this far. 

Remember to be kind not only to others, but also to yourself. :)"
happy,"I was being intimate with a white guy and I’m an awkward person so I said I had “hair extensions” and he didn’t mind. He didn’t care at all. He treated me like a normal person… he even touched my head gently a couple of times which made my hairstyle a bit messy but nothing bad happened.

I used to struggle very heavily with self harm. It used to be an urge and I would just cut and cut. BUT after a while of work and therapy, along with my friends and working on myself. I have now been clean of ANY form of self harm for 7 MONTHS!!! I know that to most people this doesn't seem like much, but as someone who has attempted in the past this is MASSIVE for me and I cried after just thinking about it.

happy,"

My professor had embarrassed me in front of the whole class because I did not know one answer. He started asking me my name and throwing comments about how I don't know anything and all. He made me stand in front of everyone. Nevertheless, I, someone who's suffering from anxiety disorder and severe anxiety, someone who gets embarrassed so very easily, for the first time, did not get embarrassed. 

I was pretty chill tbh. I did not have a raised heartbeat, I did not feel extremely sad, I did not panic, I might have had a few tics but that's it. After he left, I just went about doing my job and honestly I was impressed with myself. Idk whether this happended because I have a bigger embarrassing situation/trauma to deal with such that this felt so small or because I was already tired of everyone's sh!t. 

It happened and I'm honestly kinda happy."

thank you all, folks!"
happy,"(Just to preface this, it happened yesterday, and I wrote it yesterday, so it’s in present tense, but happened yesterday)

So I have a lot of very noticeable self harm scars on my legs. Especially my right thigh. They’re basically all over, and pretty close to my knees. If I wear shorts, they’re extremely visible. Today, it was 85 degrees, and I also am in track and field.

I was super super nervous about wearing shorts to school today, because it’d really be the first time anyone would have seen my scars, and I was just freaking out. The day had gone pretty good, 2 girls asked me what happened to my leg, I just said “it’s not important” and they left it at that.

Then, at the end of track practice, a guy a couple grades older than me comes up to me, and says “hey, amazing-flute-piano, are those scars?” As he gestures towards his own leg. Internally, I’m dying. Like I’m soooo nervous for what he’s about to say.

I just say “yea, they are”. Then he says “I think you’re so incredibly brave for wearing shorts. That takes a lot of courage.” And I just thanked him.

I also smiled. I did more than smile. I cried. I started crying from the sheer gratefulness and gratitude I felt. I started crying because I never expected those words to come out of anyone’s mouth, let alone another high schoolers. I started crying because that meant so much to me. It made me feel so happy. It truly did. It made me feel like I wasn’t alone, and that not everyone will judge me. It made me feel proud, and not ashamed.

Tomorrow, I have a class with him, and I’m going to make sure that I thank him again, because he deserves it. 🤍"

happy,"This morning I was walking around my apartment and my feet were cold from the tile floor. This was annoying until I realized that this meant my feet’s nerves were working again 🥳🥳🥳🥳. 

This is the first time this year it’s been cold where I live, so I’m not sure how long I have been able to feel the bottom of my feet for. Maybe it came back slowly and I just didn’t notice?

So what happened was several years ago I lost the feeling on the bottom of my feet and toes from wearing high heels for sorority recruitment. I was wearing high heels on concrete for 6 days around 10 hours a day and since I’m tall I had to stand in the back and jump nonstop every time girls were entering or leaving our sorority house.

After a few months the feeling returned to my toes but not the pads of the bottom of my feet. I had seen several specialists and they said pretty much there’s nothing we could do except wait and hope the nerves came back. After a couple of years I didn’t think they would ever come back.

I do not know how it is possible that the nerves could repair themselves years later. But they’re definitely back. I used my finger nail on the bottom of my feet and I can feel it so it isn’t just temperature I can feel 🥳🥳🥳

My feet now feel super tingly from the cold so I think they’re just having to readjust to being able to feel again or something but I’m so excited🥳🥳🥳"
happy,"So for the past 3 months I’ve been managing the little money I had since work stopped paying us but it wasn’t just my office apparently it was the whole country like everyone working under the government wasn’t getting paid or isn’t getting paid let me say it was just a week  ago my sister even said they paid them but other offices not yet. Eventually my money finished and I ended with things I needed to do but had no money and worst of all a few days ago my cousin kept bugging me about a money I owed her this really made me so worried because I hate owing people money and hate people thinking I’m deliberately refusing to pay them but I really didn’t have the money 

I even cried because it’s not like I could borrow from someone else to pay her because no one ever believes me when I say I’m broke they just think I want to get more money or they think she is from a rich family her parents definitely give her money whenever she wants. They don’t, my parents have never believed in giving their kids everything, I mean they give other peoples kids everything but not theirs so I guess everyone would think they treat us the same way but it’s not like that 

Anyways today my mom called and said hey I sent you some money and the first thing I said what do you need me to get for you or pay or who should I send it to because that usually it and she said no it’s for you. For a second I thought she was joking and I was like what did you say I should do with this money, and she said it’s for you. I was so happy I wanted to cry. So I asked can I really use this money and she goes yes. I don’t know how she knew I needed money so badly because I didn’t tell anyone but I guess she could tell since she is my mom and I love her so much. Though it didn’t solve all my problems it solved the one I was most worried about it. My mom didn’t need to send me the money but she did and I’m so grateful for that

Update: I got paid today finally 😊. Thanks for the sweet comments my mom really is a great mom. I feel like her sending me that money had something to do with me finally getting paid after 3 months. Maybe a coincidence or something I don’t know but I just want to believe that. Though I only got paid for one month it’s still better than nothing "
happy,"First time in almost 7 years that I had a date in a arcade, then we went for some Asian street food (kinda expensive on my country but soooo great) 

I'm really hoping the rest of the year will be even better"
happy,Was starting to feel worthless. I could cry I’m so stoked.
happy,One of my closest friends went to NYC in an au pair exchange and I painted one of my favorite photos of us  with watercolor and then I gave it to her at the airport before she got on the plane! 💗 She loved btw and it's now on her bedside table in her bedroom at her host family house. 
happy,"They’re both just one year old and my first two puppies.  

I’ve been in a totally dark place for the last two months from losing my girl, my bestfriend, but I’m so thankful that my other dog has saved me. Although I’d forever miss and think about my girl, I will look at this birthday as a start of a new life for me and this wonderful boy. That there is hope for me. 

Happy New Year everyone!"
happy,"Five years ago I didn't see a future for myself at all. I was sleeping in my rideshare rental car, was in a crappy part time job that I hated, and was living with severe anxiety. Sixteen months ago, I took a chance and decided to give school another try. Thanks to financial aid and scholarships, tuition assistance from my current job, and support from a lot of people around me, I now have an AA in Political Science and graduated Phi Theta Kappa with honors. I have gotten offers from several schools to transfer/finish my BA, including some really good schools (one is an Ivy League school). I've wanted to move to the East Coast (NYC area) since I was 15 and finally have the opportunity at the end of this year, and will be finishing my BA there. My dream is to become a history teacher; history is AWESOME because it helps us to learn about so many facets of society and humanity, and education is a very noble, yet very under-appreciated field that I wish more people would look into. Learning is magical, and as long as we are alive, we have a chance to learn something new."
happy,GRAD SCHOOL HERE I COME WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
happy,"So I have a lazy right eye and I'm right handed for everything.  When I look through the scope I don't  have an easy time lining up the scope because my left eye is dominate and tries to take focus. When I close my left eye, my already squinty eye gets worse. So I haven't shot in years because its so hard. 

I decided I needed a new hobby that got me outside so I started practicing left handed. After an hour or so I had the gun sited in. The tree is 75 freedom units away. I taped it so I could see if the pellet hit or just took the bark away. 

The second pic is me trying to hit the ribbon, then trying to hit the same hole. Didn't work.  You can see the 2nd small nick. That was from 30 fu's free hand.  The hits on the  post were my next two shots from 100fu's leaning against the outhouse. Trying to hit the stick, then hit the same pellet spot. I can't see the pellets but I was just aiming for what i think is the same spot."
happy,"He loves history , spiders , technology , art and America . He’s got the most wonderful blue eyes and he likes to play in the snow like me. 

It’s never been about his appearance or anything material . I love his mind. I love speaking with him. I love every word out of his mouth. I’ve truly never felt such a deep passion for somebody. 

He’s 30 and I’m 25 and I swear I went 25 years of my life searching for a mind and soul like his . 

I love when we passionately flirt with each other and talking about breathing each other in and caressing each other . 

I love staying up late at night messaging him till I fall asleep and hearing him say his praises to me . 

C I love you forever and I want to be with you forever like this 

Give it 2 more years when I’m done with school and I think we’ll get married and by 5 more I think we might be able to have a family .. 

I wanna spend every thanksgiving and Christmas with you for the rest of my life 

C …. Please stay with me forever … you’re a beaming star in my night sky "
happy,I am in 9th grade and I was just going through so kinda rough times my ex was spreading rumors and her friend (a boy) wanted to jump me with a group of friends and it finally stopped. I had a track meet today and I couldn't run in the meet because I got injured in gym class (sprained knee). So I was taking times for all the running events and this one girl (senior) did a really good job on hurdles. When I got in the car the first thing I did was add her on snap to give her congrats on doing so well and it turned into us getting to know each other and then I asked her if being an adult is hard and she told me it wasent and reassured me it's actually fun because you can drive and get more jobs. We ended up talking about our plans for out of high school. This girl helped my fears of adulthood and actually made me exited for it.
happy,"Around November of last year I (26F) matched with this guy(26M), he's honestly one of the sweetest guys I've met on a dating app. We were talking for a whole, but had to go out seprate ways, because he was unemployed then and looking for a job and had other things going on in his life. He felt like he couldn't give me time. Which was totally ok and understable. 

Anyway in one of our conversation where he was stressed about not getting a job, I remember giving him a pep talk, and he told me then that when he gets a job I'll be one of the first few people he'll tell. 

It's been around two months since we stopped talking and he texted me today that he got a hired! I'm also suprised that he remembered and texted me about his job. I'm so happy for him. In suprising turn off events in currently unemployed after leaving a toxic workspace and seeing him get a job, made me feel not so bad about my own unemployment. So to whoever is in the same boat. We got this! We'll get a good job that will make us happy."
happy,Last visit to my cancer center. 5 years free and was released to my family doctor for yearly follow ups.
happy,"This is gonna start off sad, but I swear it gets better. 

August 2021 I graduated college. October 2021 I was given a job offer for a career I was incredibly excited about. The job offer payed decently, and was a stepping stone for my ex-gf and I at the time to be able to start moving our relationship into a more adult-relationship; ie, moving out, buying a house, etc. 

January 2022 I started at my job and loved it. March 2022 came around, and my ex at the time had blind-sided me and left without a word. I was devastated at the time. Fast forward a few months to October, I’m at the gym and I feel a tendon in the back of my leg snap. I can’t walk. I eventually go to the doctor who just diagnoses me with a strain and tells me to go to PT. 

Long story short, I visited 2 different doctors. Both of whom could not give me a proper diagnosis which caused the PT I received to only make things worse. I was on disability from my job to take care of my leg which just wouldn’t get better, as well as therapy for depression. Eventually, I was forced to leave my job, lost my health insurance, and didn’t know if I’d ever be able to walk again. I was alone, depressed, disabled, unemployed, and had no idea about the future and what was going to happen to me. 

Eventually, I found a physio who I was able to see via Zoom (about $20/visit, so I could afford it without insurance) who was able to diagnose me and we started a PT program that I was able to do by myself. It took a long time, but she got me back on my feet, back in the gym, back to running and everything. It took me about a year to walk again. It was an extremely long process. 

Near the end of my PT, I met this woman. Smart, funny, gorgeous, kind, driven and hard working, incredibly emotionally intelligent, and… well I could go on for hours talking about this woman. We hit it off, and started dating. She’s introduced me to so many new hobbies, many of which are active activities. Some team sports, and some individual sports. I’ve started some new sports of my own, and have began to introduce her to them as well. Not only has meeting her changed my life romantically, but I’ve also gotten very close to all of her friends of which she has many. When my leg didn’t work and I lost my job, I was alone almost 24/7. I had very little help with anything from family and friends. It was the darkest time of my life. Now, I feel like it’s one of the most social and happiest times of my life. It’s been a complete 180 from where I was before. 

When my leg got better, I also applied for a federal job. I’d always wanted to work for the federal government, not just for the benefits but also for the job security. It was a very long and stressful process, but just last week I received the email with a firm job offer and I am due to begin working with them next week. 

My life has completely changed. I was in the darkest time of my life, not knowing what was going to happen to me and not knowing if I’d ever be able to walk again, hold a job, etc. I’ve now picked up a handful of new hobbies, I’m exercising and running frequently, I have a new career which I’m beyond ecstatic to begin, and a wonderful girlfriend of which I can see an actual future with. 

Words cannot begin to describe how absolutely ecstatic I am for what my future holds. "
happy,She was on opiates/heroin really hard but i loved her even then and just hoped she could over come it.  She did and we got togethor and have a beautiful 5 month old daughter. Anyone out there using you can beat that *%#!. 
happy,We had a long and semi mild winter but with the freezes and thaws it's taken my garden to bloom any flowers. These daffodils are usually also eaten or picked by my children so this has been so nice to enjoy their beautiful blooms.
happy,"i've so many years hating my voice, i never like recording my voice or send voice messages, until a few days ago i recorded a video, when i was playing it that i noticesd that my voice changed since last time i recording my voice (maybe 4 yrs ago), my voice used to soud like the cracky puberty nerd voice... now i feel good about my voice and love how thad sounds. could sound sptupid but i feel good about that change, sounds more like an adult (i'm about 30yrs old), idk if my voice change or my perception changed but i feel more comfortable."
happy,Not to Jinx myself and I'm knocking on wood. But next week I've been at my job eleven years. It makes me happy because growing up I had learning issues and was in special Ed. And the teachers were not nice. I was told I would never go to college and ide never hold a job. I have so far done both. And I feel..well proud of myself in a way I've beaten odds and expectations. I was told i would be nothing but a failure.
happy,"An undergraduate student I have mentored for the past two-ish years applied to graduate school for the Fall 2024 admissions cycle. I helped them a lot with their applications and talked through deciding where to apply, etc. I've been getting periodic texts from them over the last few weeks as they've received their admissions (and one rejection so far) and it's been such an honor to share in their excitement. They even said I'm one of the first people they want to tell and that just put me over the moon.

Today they got an acceptance into a BIG school and one that was sort of a ""shoot for the stars"" application and I just shrieked and hollered when I got their message. Tears are streaming down my cheeks, but they are happy happy tears. What a privilege to be able to experience this joy with them. Truly an honor. I'm so lucky."
happy,"Hi Reddit! I’ve been trying to use my account as an outlet to manage my feelings and healing. I am so excited to share that I was finally able to mow my lawn, rake my leaves, and plant a few seeds in my yard today! Some backstory (trigger warning: SA), I was sexually assaulted by a man that lived on my street, and for the longest time, I was nervous to work on my yard in my front lawn because I did not want to see him. But, he finally moved out. I was so excited to see the moving truck near his house. I don’t have to hire a lawn crew anymore and I don’t have to take the long route walking to try and avoid this person. I am very excited and happy. I haven’t done my own yard work for a long time and I feel very good. 🥰"
happy,You can do it too!!!
happy,"Hope my cat can brighten your day

My cat always brightens my day every day she brings a smile to my face , every day she brings a smile to my face

I hope this nice picture of her can also brighten your day. She is such a loving cat.

Hope you have all had a great day"
happy,He’s getting out and I’m going to ft Campbell I’m lowkey depressed since I know not a single soul out there and all my friends I had are either somewhere else or gone and I tend to stick to a crowd that doesn’t drink the kookaid 24/7 I’m happy but deeply sad any advice?
happy,"This was filmed at their album release party this past January. I think it rocks and wanted to share. They’re on Spotify and are already ready for a second album this summer. Really happy for him, he’s the guitarist in the cowboy hat and wrote this instrumental!"
happy,I have been wanting to start a landscaping business for awhile now. The weather just started to turn the corner so I am going to go door to door after work today to see if I can get a little lawn care route going! I'm so exci
happy,"I worked all year while doing school (the maximum amount of hours I was allowed to do I did), I worked during all my breaks and I haven't gone on any trips out of state because I wanted to feel financially sane more than wanting to go out. I've been living bill to bill, rent to rent, month to month and sometimes had to borrow to meet the rent (since my pay is bi weekly).

I've been so bitter all year. Initially it hurt that I had to work and do my difficult stem course and worry about feeding myself while all my friends and classmates lived in their lavish apartments close to school as I commuted from far away to save money. But I don't feel bitter anymore!


I know what living month to month feels like so I'm gonna still do max hours of work. But I'm gonna be able to give myself 2 weeks of breaks between semesters now. 


I'm moving in with my boyfriend too which will reduce my rent by so much since we're splitting.

&#x200B;

I'm so happy. I hope no crisis will take away this safety net I have built. I hope that when my parents travel here I can pay for all of their needs. I'm just happy man. Fingers crossed!!

happy,I felt so happy to see nature and these ducks. 
happy,He’s so cute!!! I love him cause we both love dumplings and we’re both fun dumplings cause I think that’s way cute to say plus I got lots of candy it’s so much I love it! I usually have trouble deciding candy so I got Tootsie Rolls (my favorite) and a lot of the cute ones like gummy bears and gummy hearts and roses plus some gummy diamonds they’re blue and everything!!!! And that one that’s pastel blue and pink is called a Unicorn Gummy I think and I love love love LOVE unicorns🤞🏼😋!!! His shirt says “Hugs” and I got a cute bag that has him in and I got a picture with the giant giant bear inside I would’ve gotten an outside picture of the store but there were people there and I didn’t wanna stop on the middle of the walkway🙁 and the woman doing the bear fluffy stuffing was going to have me step on the button and I couldn’t (I have anxiety and got nervous😾) apparently a lot o people think they’re too old for this stuff?????? That’s crazy to me cause I never really thought like that cause I love Build-a-Bear and NEED the new Sesame Street ones !
happy,"Backstory: my grandfather played for Ike & Tina Turner in the 60’s. He “retired” from playing about 12 years ago, but tonight I convinced him to play one last time to end 2023. 
The sax he’s playing is a Buescher Aristocrat built in 1949 that was purchased for him by his father. He gifted me the saxophone for my 26th birthday & I start lessons next week. 
I’m infinitely proud of him & have some big shoes to fill. Happy New Year! 🎉"
happy,"Growing up I was always in special education classes and have a real hard time learning. I was addicted to meth for 16 years and have been sober for 14. I started working at a treatment center in the kitchen, and never thought that I would ever have my own office able to help people struggling with substances. The thought of passing this test was so far-fetched. Anyway, on the 31st I passed my test and feel about 2 inches taller. And for somebody of my stature that’s a big deal lol I have been happy dancing all week. Now I have a career that I can provide for my 15-year-old son. Which I got full custody of when I was five years sober. Life is so good. If you’re struggling but doing the right thing, keep it up it pays off."
happy,"I'm celebrating my 21st at Disney with my momma and we've been many times since I was 6 years old. Because I'm chronically online, I would call her immature, lazy, boot licking capitalist because this is the only place I've been on vacation. She just told me this will probably be our last trip together since I'm getting older and graduating soon. I started crying uncontrollably because I realized this is our happy place. This is OUR special place we make memories. I'm constantly surrounding myself around miserable people because of my mental health conditions alongside me being queer. There is beauty in traditions and my momma loves me so much and more than anything in the world."

happy,Very damn well pleased with myself.
happy,"To all my fellow singles out there and to those that are missing/can’t be with their significant other today, remember this:

You have the ability to light your own spark.  We all want that sense of completion with someone else by our side.  We all fantasize about being whole.  The over-commercialization of romantic love makes it even worse. The truth is, we are whole just as we are.  Sure we all come with baggage but that doesn’t make us incomplete.  This is your reminder that you don’t have to go through today feeling alone.  This is your chance to pour all of your love into the most important person in your life: you!

Right now, I’m sitting with a glass of my favorite (Verdi) wine, snuggling with Bruno the stuffed red dragon and my two cats.  I bought myself flowers again this year and added the purple rose because they are my favorite.  I lit my favorite Apotheke candle.  There’s salmon broiling in the oven that I’ll be pairing with  broccoli and basmati rice.  Later, I’ll cuddle under the blankets and watch a movie.  It’s all I’d want to do with a partner.  Why should being single change that?

How are you spending today?  I hope it is filled with peace and not a reminder of what could have/should have been.  Seize your happiness.  You deserve it."
happy,I’m so happy to see how far he has come and to watch him get healthy!
happy,"I'm solo traveling at the moment and I've had the realisation that I'm a completely different person than I was when I was younger (I'm 32 now). I remember back then I was so insecure and I dealt with crippling anxiety. I was so self aware and ashamed of myself that I had to mentally prepare myself to do grocery shopping because I was so afraid that people would judge me. I've never been conventionally attractive, but back then I was convinced I I was absolutely hideous and I didn't deserve good things. I feel so sorry for my younger self. Now I don't give a crap about what people think of me, I've accepted myself for who I am and find beauty in small things. Sometimes I still struggle with my appearance, but not in the self destructive way as I did ten years ago.I try to always be kind to myself and treat myself how I treat good friends. At the moment I'm doing whatever I want whenever I want, all the choices I make, I make for me. It is so freeing. I feel so much love for myself, ny life, my friends and family, my work.
God I love solo traveling."
happy,Family dog didn't want to come inside from the snow. So I took a break from work and spent some quality time appreciating the outdoors. I'm glad I trusted his instinct.
happy,"So I’m 17 and an engineering intern. I started last year mid-February and it’s been going pretty good. At Christmas, I got a $330 bonus ($200 after taxes) and I was super happy with that. Today, my boss stopped by my office and said they usually give out year end bonuses but their system wasn’t working right this year so it was a bit late. He said to remember that I’m only really part time and when I said I appreciate it no matter what he said “it’s better than a stick in the eye”. 

So after he said that, I thought it was gonna be like $100 max right, but I open it and see ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS!! It’s $640 after taxes and I know that isn’t a ton to some people BUT I AM SUPER HAPPY. And yesterday I found out I’m getting $1500 back in taxes so I am going to be absolutely ballin!!!! HELL YEAH!!!"

happy,"My mom has been a green thumb enthusiasts. Her garden is a beautiful mess with half edibles and flowers and it's a little slice of her happy place.


But she has always been strictly a roses, carnations and dahlias only gardener with the odd daisy, marigold or iris thrown in. Wildflowers to her were the equivalent of weeds (lol).


A few weeks ago, I had been feeling down and I saw a video of a wildflower meadow that looked stunning. I mentioned to my mum about how happy they made me due to the bright colors, the bees and butterflies it attracted. That's it, that's all I said. She nodded and didn't say much. 


Well this morning I saw the tall grassy patch she had left to 'recover and compost' before she planted veg in had wildflowers. 


She seeded the bare patch for me without asking. Just because it made me happy. It made me feel so loved in that moment. Mom cares. She heard and saw what I was feeling and decided to build me a small wildflower patch so I could sit outside and escape my depression.


After years of a rocky relationship, we are finally building a solid foundation with wildflowers."

happy,"Undergraduate Completion

This story is about my journey as a college student and the joy I have at its completion.

I started my 5-year undergraduate degree in accounting during the fall of 2018. The first year was pure bliss; I gained so many friends, lost my virginity, felt heartbreak, expanded my understanding of the world and came to love diversity. I had earned a position as an RA for my sophomore year with one of my new, and still, great friends. 

Fall of 2019 started as the Residential Department put it, ""Gaining 60 new contracted friends"". I put my life into creating the best experience for both my residents and myself. Come March of 2020, this was shattered. COVID-19 officially shut down my campus and everyone was sent home. Uncertainty of the next year lasted until summer when our accepted return was announced. With many new rules and being shipped off into a different housing area, I was apprehensive to say the least. 

Fall of 2020 was the beginning of my hidden, yet sharp, mental decline. It is here my met my most sincere and closest friends beyond my home as well. The seclusion was otherwise agonizing and I had turned to drinking on the weekends with a small group of friends for the majority of the college year.  By summer of 2021, I had landed an internship in my field of study, entered a relationship, and received a promotion from RA to CA. The internship was phenomenal and the relationship amazing, though I found myself constantly crying and was put on am anti-depressant as depression runs in my family.

Fall of 2021, I was now entering the depths of my studies, additional responsibilities from my position, and my s/o was now 2 hours away. The anti-depressants dramatically worsened my mentality and became secluded from my studies, relationship, and job all at once. I dropped 2 classes in an attempt to reduce the load, to no avail. By winter of 2022, the relationship had ended in pain from depression+guilt and my education and job faltered further. I stepped down from my role as a CA to RA and took fewer classes to start the next year. Summer of 2022 was jobless in an attempt to regain my mental fortitude. 

Fall of 2022 did not last long. Immediately I was shunted into the same routine of depressive behavior, this time accompanied by suicidal ideation. As I was failing every class and effectively not working as is, I dropped out of college just before Thanksgiving to live at home and continue online next semester. Spring of 2023 I had begun seeing a psychiatrist as well as therapist weekly. My class load was very light as I was surely going to need an extra year to graduate. I tried new medications bi-monthly and my therapist was unhelpful for myself. I completed some summer courses but sank deeper and deeper in depression. 

Fall of 2023 was the worst time of my 24 years of existence thus far. Although my course load was still light, I had no point in living. I was divising painless ways to commit suicide and preserve my body for my family. I was ready to die when I started a new medication (Cymbalta) and started seeing a new therapist.

My life changed.

This medication with a dedicated therapist who cared about me and my wellbeing rocketed me out of the 6-foot hole. Within 3 months of dedicated medication rigorous therapy, I had finally stopped my suicidal ideation. Winter of 2024 was the first time I felt alive in almost 3 years. I felt pure happiness again for the first time 1 month ago. I am alive again.

As of May 11, 2024, I have walked across the stage, accepted my diploma for accounting, and am *effectively* depression free. I breathe as this chapter is completed. I felt the sun of my skin today, felt what it is like to be human. What it is like to be alive. 

I wanted to share this joy with others in hopes to encourage growth and foster hope. I am alive and far beyond well as I work to create the best me I can for the world.

happy,"I got a new co-worker 6 month ago and I was her mentor and organized her onboarding. Today she said to me, that she hopes I will get promoted zo be the boss of our little Team (4 people) at the end of the year since she believe I would be great as a leader."
happy,"

I guess I'm just trying to put some good vibes for myself out on a night where I feel rather low. I honestly didn't think I could get this far but since February I've lost 32lbs according to my scale this morning. It's probably more once I poop...if I poop."
happy,"I (25m) am in a relationship for the first time in my adult life and can not describe how happy I am.

Towards the end of October last year my boss told me that one of my co-workers (23f) who I did also consider a friend had told her she had a crush on me. I admitted that while I had never really considered it before, if she was interested I was willing to give it a go. We started flirting and a couple weeks later we had our first date. 

The funny part is that at the beginning of January my now girlfriend and I were talking and it came out that while we were definitely friends rather than just co-workers at the time, neither of us had considered a romantic relationship until our boss told us both that the other was interested and we realized that our boss had just been bored and decided to play matchmaker. We have since confronted our boss and thanked her for doing what she did.

We are both incredibly happy with our situation now and incredibly grateful to our bored meddling boss for setting us up (and creating two incredibly inefficient employees)."
happy,"Life update: you may remember me from this post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/b5p72v/comment/ejhehp6/](https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/b5p72v/comment/ejhehp6/)

But so many things have happened since then. You guys truly changed my life at that moment and I wouldn't have even gotten started without you guys. I've been picked up by a small but pretty successful publisher, DYB Publishing, for both my seven book fantasy series and science fiction trilogy.  I also went to my first anime convention last week and almost sold out (despite me almost dying from social anxiety). And I just wanted to come by and thank all of you! Also here are some pictures! 

(Actually it was five years ago on the original post. Time is nebulous).

happy,"After four years - a first year in lockdown and a second year with near-daily debilitating panic attacks - I finally have friends at university. 

Before this year, I never showed up to course events, social events, nothing - I thought that cliques had already formed and it was way too late. 

This year, I challenged myself by going to events, and I found that people weren’t as closed off as I thought they’d be. 

I’m finally being invited to parties and karaoke nights, etc., I feel like I’m a part of a group in a way I never have been before.  

I’m so proud of myself for going out of my comfort zone and being confident as I could. 

Note: this kind of social life doesn’t equal happiness for everyone! I have many introverted moments, I can promise you that."
happy,"Even tho it’s quite embarrassing I wanted to share this. This is Caesar my poodle puppy who is ready to greet me early every morning. This means I have to get up and out to walk him first thing, something that I COULD NOT and WOULD NOT ever do before I had him because of my agoraphobia. He has given me more independence and has made me progress so much faster. He even helps with my panic attacks. But most importantly I love him and he makes me happy!"
happy,"Friday my friend told me she overheard teacher's talking about how they wanted *me* in their classes, some of them I had never even talk to/had a class with. Another teacher told an EA (my friend's mom) how excited she was to have me in her class AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
happy,"I'm a few states away from home for a conference this week, and during some downtime I looked up things to do nearby. Turns out the art museum a short walk away had my FAVORITE sculpture on display, I didn't even know it had been put into a collection! 

L' Amante by Beth Cavener is every bit as beautiful in real life as I could have imagined and I am SO excited to have been able to marvel at it with my own two eyes!"
happy,"So basically I (20 M) have lost a shit ton of weight from say weighing 120 kilograms to right now weighing 83 kgs. I regularly go to the gym and I have them muscles too. There's just one teeny tiny issue. I was a hell of a glutton when I was chubby, and that habit still persists in the form of my sweet tooth and binge eating, though not often. 
Today, particularly, I'd eaten more than I'm supposed to, on my calorie deficit, by say 200-300 kcals, and all the PTSD came rushing to my head. I know it's not healthy, but this does not happen often. Okay so, my girlfriend rudely cut my video call cause her friend called and the girls had a nice time putting on face masks and stuff (when my girl (19 F) had told me before that she would do that with me on video call, while we talk.) So obviously this made me feel bad, and along with the PTSD, made my emotions avalanche down the fkin mountain. 
Cue me calling my girl a bit later, she goes ""tell me what's the matter"" in the most bored voice ever. I couldn't stop myself, tears started flowing down my eyes. I didn't know how to tell her what the matter was, and that made my emotions plummet even more.
However, after a while, I gathered composure, told my girlfriend the reasons, that I missed my father, and my grandmothers every single day, think about the days they were alive, and that I get motivation from them, to succeed. I told her about the PTSD regarding my body image issues, and what I consider as freedom from this: I want to be able to rip of my shirt and wear shorts without worrying about my physique whatsoever. (Not to mention I want that athletic physique and am working towards it). 
Where I knew that I'd won, with her as my girlfriend, is when she listened through everything, then at the end, told me stuff I exactly wanted to hear. That how she'd shown a pump picture of mine to one of her guy friends and how the guy praised my physique, how she'd storied a picture of me with a beautiful Persian cat (she was absolutely wonderful, the cat) on instagram, and how her friend replied ""Where were such beautiful and wonderful guys when I was searching for them? What kinda black magic did you perform that suddenly you get such a great guy to be your boyfriend?"". I feel absolutely elated right now.
There was this day I wore a semi-transparent shirt out, and my girl said today: listen babe, yk, I know we went to a temple that day but I could not help thinking unholy shit to do to you.
I am so fucking happy right now. i hope I marry this girl someday."
happy,"I hope he was talking about post-serum! 

But in all seriousness, made my day. When kids are nice, it just seems so genuine. Same kid also asked me if I was a D1 basketball player while I was shooting around (I’m not even close!)

Anyway, it just made me happy."
happy,"ljust need to let this out to some one but I'm finally happy in a relationship, my last one was exhausting and it was to the point that my new S/0 was confused why was so happy when she came into the store with me. I also almost cried when the first time I was at work and she stayed at my place she had cleaned the entire place just cuz, no one has ever done that and it ment so much to me,It just feels like such a great weight off my shoulders and made me feel something I've never felt before. I can't wait to take her on her first vacay in Sept to show how much she means to me and to spend time with he in Disney. 

Also wanted to let people know that love is out there, if this woman can love a 23 year old autistic guy with 10k in Legos, then there is hope for everyone out there."
happy,That’s all. I’m a 53-year-old woman and I melted right then and there.
happy,Met my bestfriends girlfriend and when we were alone for a little bit she told me “he talks about you all the time and it’s really obvious you mean so much to him and he looks up to you. i’m really glad he has you he needs you”. It just felt so damn good man. Usually it’s people talking bad behind your back but he is praising me to his GIRLFRIEND. I feel so loved man.
happy,"Made lunch clearly not fancy lol. But lovely to feel mentallyand physically okay to and wanted to after a awful time and physical pain and as he always makes me gorgeous food, proud of him and its a sunny day ❤️"
happy,"My son loves to play outside. The house next to us is being rebuilt so it is unoccupied at the moment. There is a small pond located on the property so every now and then we venture over there to see what sort of wildlife we can spot. Yesterday, disappointment struck when we arrived to the pond and didn’t spot any animals. Normally there’s at least a few ducks, but not today. After about 10 minutes he looked down at the ground, picked up a very high-quality stick, and threw it into the water. The stick struck the water. The splash made him so happy he exclaimed, “I did it dada, I did it.” It took me a second but then I realized, wow he is so happy because of the stick hitting the water! Mind you, I have never thrown anything into this pond before, so this was just his primal instinct telling him “pick up stick, throw stick water, stick make splash, make boy happy”… anyways I thought I’d share this because it was enough to make a grown-man cry. Such simple acts can bring so much joy. We’re such simple creatures haha. Have a great day everyone

"
happy,"I'm a minor, just fyi

For the past half of a year I have been in love with my friend. Their kind, and funny, and really sweet, not to mention cute. And I though it was not mutual, I even started telling myself that I just had to get over them, but recently another friend of ours cracked a joke about how they liked me so much, and when said friend left, leaving me alone with them, I asked about it, to which they responded they didn't know. I told them I liked them, and they got so excited, asking me over and over again if I was being for real. They told me so many cute things, like ""you make me feel like I'm so cared about"" and ""you're face- it just makes sense to me."" And we started dating and they tell me how they spend waiting in lines fantasizing about spending time with me. I genuinely didn't know I could be so happy."
happy,"Today I (17 m) was home alone and started to take out the ingredients (pasta and frozen cubed chicken) but then I thought f*ck it, imma be brave today and boil frozen meat balls in tomato sauce instead of just heating up the chicken in the microwave. It went much better than the last times, I didn’t even think I  would start a fire, unlike the other times. I’m so proud of myself!"
happy,I’m going to be an uncle for the first time and I’m just so excited!
happy,I’m 44. Never thought I’d have kids. Today that changed. Say hi to Annie.
happy,"Lately I've been into collage thanks to the algorithm making me watch videos of scrapbooking and journaling. I've never been good with handmade stuff and I'm very conscious of it because I've never been ""excellent"" with that type of stuff. But that videos are really nice to watch and I keep thinking I want to do it too.

As soon as I told my husband that I wanted to try it he lent me his account for buying the materials even though we're on a tight budget (I had surgery recently because of a broken bone in my left hand). He never said ""You can't do it"", ""You aren't good with those things"", ""You only do it because of the videos"" or other stupid things I thought when I decided to tell him I wanted to try it. He even said it was nice because I could do it as rehab for my hand... It's been a week since then and he's following our orders and even helping me do my first collages because there's some things I still can't do with my hand.

I was afraid that as I finished my first one he would notice I'm terrible at it and maybe he would be mad for spending that money but quite the contrary he said it looked good and encouraged me to keep going.

He's not only aknowledging my desire to try a new hobby as valid but also he's giving me courage to challenge myself in things I always felt unsuited for.

 I'm really thankful for him..."
happy,"Got paid for my voice acting today!!!!

I AM SO HAPPY!!! I got paid for doing voice acting work—my very first paid VA work of the year! It wasn’t much but it makes me very happy! Makes me feel like I’m doing something right!! I only said a few lines, haha!! BUT STILL!!!!!"
happy,"I was a mess for two decades, booze, coke, just whatever. I have now made it two years without a drink or any coke. I'm so happy right now. I was able to go back to school and I went from a 36 waist to a 30. I later gave up sodas and energy drinks, but alcohol was the tough one. Two years!!!"
happy,"Whether it's a big life success or just taking time to look at the daisies, I want to hear about what's made you smile and feel happy to be here. This is a great place to get some celebration for your successes or have someone share in your joy."
happy,"Hi guys, 

So I’ve been doing some meditations that have really been working for me lately and I have a few things in my life that are going well and am in a couple blessed situations. I’m starting to have moment of real happiness on levels I don’t know if I’ve had before. I think mostly due to the meditations because it’s not externally dependent. 

I still have daily struggles and things I’m working on. A lot more than people know. Even the fact that I’m working on my struggles and am seeing them getting better is making me happy. I’ve had a lot of suffering in my life, especially within myself about myself and to witness imrovement is like witnessing a wonder, a miracle. 

I keep running into the situation where I tell people about the good things in my life, in a super excited way, (it could even be a new positive way I’m perceiving the world), and I feel (or at least perceive (I could be projecting)) it making people uncomfortable or I feel that I am being too much. I notice within me a fear of being unrelatable expressing the goodness in my life. I’m afraid of making people jealous. I feel like I need to then tone down the positive thing I said with something more “down to earth” (though I don’t because I see that urge rising from an anxiety about how others perceive me and to not try to “fix” it) 

I feel like I need to be more tactful than I am and I’m curious if anyone has any advice? One thing I’m trying not to do is tone myself down for others comfort (I’ve often done this when going out to not make other girls jealous) but also I don’t want to come off as chaotic or make people feel bad. 

On some level writing this does make me feel like it’s okay to be unapologetically happy/well. Maybe that’s how relaxed people are and I’m just learning/relearning it. 

Grateful for your input.
Thank you . "
happy,"Been talking to this girl for a actually not that long just two or thre months, has not been the best start but currently it's been working really well actually. got to hang out and yeah she's starting to text me on her own whenever we didn't text much throughout the day, asking me how my day has been. Seems stupid but it really means alot to me because i have had a really  exhausting  time with relationships and had little to no female friends and never talking to anyone or socializing for days and feeling left alone and it's been a while since my last relationship that was more than just sleeping together. I mean intimicay doesn't do much for me if i don't feel emotionally connected. Nothing made me happier recently than when she texts me and asks how my day was or when we just talk about Mutual interests and shit. Life has been really good recently."
happy,Today is day 1 of no contact after being married to a narcissist for 8 years this is the hardest thing I have ever done in my life I’ve lived through the abuse the torture the cheating the lies and yet I miss them but today I started making a list every time I want to call them I add to that list a reminder of all the things my brain made me forget all these years I am hoping this is day 1 of a life without being controlled 
happy,"Life is GOOD

Life is at an all time high rn. My grades are good, I'm a lot more athletic, I'm in a happy relationship (that's been going on for months now), I'm happier, and I'm making a lot of friends and most of all, my pizza rolls are done. Life is AMAZING RN!!"
happy,"I (31F) dropped out of school more times than I can remember I finished undergrad last year and found a master program that was tailored to exactly what I want to a T. I applied to this school twice in undergrad and got rejected. This has been the school of my dreams since I was a child, I grew up around it, supported the teams since I was a kid and always drove by it wanted to go to it. I got the acceptance letter today and started crying. Everything that has happened to me has lead to this point. The happiest moment of my life, if I can talk to my younger self who never believed she could end up here I would hug her. I can’t wait for this next step in my life."
happy,Edit: Guys I’m blown away from the feedback. I wasn’t expecting this to get as much love as it did. I think it just goes to show that happiness can be simple and doesn’t require any extravagant justifications for sharing your feelings. r/happy is such a great community.

happy,"“How is her brother doing?”

Weird, right? Ill make it make sense!

My best friend passed away 2 years ago, we have guardianship of her 17f daughter, and are active in her 18transM’s son’s life. We’ll call him K.

I have boomer parents. I would gently correct them when they referred to the kids as “the girls,” or used the incorrect pronouns for K. I was understanding that they were going to mess up here and there because of the generational gap, but figured after consistent gentle corrections, they would get there sooner than later.

I was wrong. After nearly 2 years, I felt I gave them more than enough grace to get it right. My mom has been the main culprit of the two because she always wants to talk about the kids, while my dad never really asked/talked about them as often (man of few words type). I started getting more aggravated and upset every time my mom would ask “how are the girls doing?” After 2 years, I just felt like my parents just didn’t care enough to even try to understand. I stopped bringing the kids around my family because I felt like it was always a negative experience for them, and refused to subject them to that kind of environment.

Fast forward to last week: I was talking to my dad on the phone. He was asking about 17f because I had mentioned she was starting school again soon and she just had a birthday. After we were done talking about her, he said the sentence:

“How is her brother doing?”

0 coaching. No correcting. Just him using his own words. 

I couldn’t believe it and actually stuttered a bit after that one sentence. That was the first time I heard one of my parents affirm his gender identity. 

My dad does care and has been listening. My heart exploded. I had hella tears.

I love my dad and am happy."
happy,"I was tired of my life. I woke up one day and realized I have been “winging” it and “half-assing” through life. I’m not in a terrible place. I have a decent paying management job in infrastructure. But this wasn’t the life young me wanted.

I got accepted in college and I’m about to start classes. I scored insanely well on the accuplacer (after countless hours studying). And the end goal is to finally pursue my dream and become a lawyer. It was my dream all as a child. But I spent too much time in high school skipping class and hitting the reefer. I graduated high school with a 2.0 GPA. I didn’t even understand math at all. I had Fs in every math class. But I self taught my self advance algebra and statistics in a matter of weeks before my test. And I’m so proud of that. (I was proud when I was doing 7th grade math test and passing lol) 

I’m sharing on here because I’m divorced and kinda alone. No one is by my side to share the joy with me. And all my coworkers laughed at me and one of my coworkers (who dropped out in 7th grade) keeps telling me how dumb I am for doing it. I just wanted to get it off my chest in a safe area because I’m genuinely stoked. 

This is a massive vent and humble brag. "
happy,"Howdy! 

I'm so appreciative of all of y'all's support! I was worried if I was overstaying my welcome on this sub, but y'all were so supportive! For anyone starting their fitness journey from my posts, or anyone who is in their own fitness journey, I'm so proud of you! I'd like to address a couple thing so constantly see in the replies. I'd rather address it on the post instead of individual comments. 

I do infact know I need a calorie deficit to lost consistent weight, and I've been on a calorie deficit since day 2

No, this is not a karma farm. Anyone who values karma so much they lie and take advantage of peoples kindness is an idiot. If you still believe this is a karma farm, that's fine but please don't be rude to or others who just want to improve their lives.

Yes, I know I'm fat, I know I'm unhealthy, you don't need to constantly spam in in the replies. Please come up with more insults because I'm running out of jokes.

happy,"First of all, English isn't my first language so please understand. 

I come from a country and a community where dating culture isn't very big. Me and my brother have a 8 year age gap (he's younger). As a result, we don't relate to the same stuff, share similar likes/dislikes or even talk a lot about our personal lives or choices. Although I find a friend in him and he's been protective, caring; he barely talks about his friends, or problems, etc. 

But today! Oh boy, I'm still smiling ear to ear!
Today he called me out of the blue( lives in a different city) and asked me for an outfit suggestion because he was going to go meet this girl he has had a crush on. That alone, made me so happy! In that moment, I knew he found me helpful, I knew he trusted me with that as probably my parents would not approve of him skipping classes to go meet her, and I was happy that he came to me when he felt like he was stuck.
I gave him a suggestion, appropriate for a first date (of his life) and he left. I was fine, happy that he was happy. It was just a little meet at a cafe at evening, they decided to have some snacks, talk etc and head back their own ways.

Fast forward three hours, HE CALLED me.. n he told me how great the date was!! I NEVER expected he'd call and share that with me! N he was so giggly (I don't know if that's even a word, sorry) and chirpy and happy and nervous and so much more lol! He told me, that she looked so beautiful this evening, that he couldn't utter a word. So he scrolled through Instagram, luckily came across a picture of  beautifully arranged flowers and he sent that post to her with a message that said - ""you look this beautiful today"". My little brother, ladies and gentlemen!! He's 19. 19!!! We never have seen anyone go on a date except in movies and stuff ig. And this guy was like 5yo just a couple years ago 🥺🥺When did he grow up so fast! 

N to top all that, he thanked me - he THANKED ME for helping him know how to treat a girl right! He thinks I'm nice. He trusts me. He ACTUALLY looks up to me!!🥺
I. Am. Melting! 
I'm happy a ton! Sorry if this is too long. To the ones who stuck till the end, you people are my angels. I just wanted to share this. ❤️

My professor had embarrassed me in front of the whole class because I did not know one answer. He started asking me my name and throwing comments about how I don't know anything and all. He made me stand in front of everyone. Nevertheless, I, someone who's suffering from anxiety disorder and severe anxiety, someone who gets embarrassed so very easily, for the first time, did not get embarrassed. 

I was pretty chill tbh. I did not have a raised heartbeat, I did not feel extremely sad, I did not panic, I might have had a few tics but that's it. After he left, I just went about doing my job and honestly I was impressed with myself. Idk whether this happended because I have a bigger embarrassing situation/trauma to deal with such that this felt so small or because I was already tired of everyone's sh!t. 

It happened and I'm honestly kinda happy."

My mental health was declining a few years back and now I feel like it might be at its positive peak which I’m eternally grateful for.

I've wanted to move to the East Coast (NYC area) since I was 15 and finally have the opportunity at the end of this year, and will be finishing my BA there. My dream is to become a history teacher; history is AWESOME because it helps us to learn about so many facets of society and humanity, and education is a very noble, yet very under-appreciated field that I wish more people would look into. Learning is magical, and as long as we are alive, we have a chance to learn something new."

I couldn't be happier with this decision. I'm aware that this will not he easy but she's at least willing. And I'm gonna stand by her and take all the crap that comes with quitting.

Posting because it feels damn good to be able to look at myself and the mirror, no makeup, acne scars and all and FINALLY feel beautiful (and not feel bad about it) 
Post your healing picture - the one that makes you proud of how far you’ve come. ♥️♥️"
happy,"I’ve done an emotional 180 over the past two years for the better! These books have helped me more than therapy, antidepressants, and sleeping pills. Some of them contain spirituality but can be enjoyed by any religion. I tell everyone I know about them and just wanted to share here!"
happy,"My absolute angel of a mother in law and I are taking my future sister in law to a little tea house as surprise! We just told her to be ready to go at a certain time and have sworn all the boys to secrecy 😊. 

Mother in law, future sister in law and I really love tea so I really hope she likes it. Both of these ladies are absolute gems to be around and I cannot be more excited to have my future sister in law join the family ❤️. She is so sweet and considerate and sassy and I love her so much! And mother in law is an absolute doll. Anything and everything she can do to help, she'll do. She's a tiny spit fire of a woman and won't hesitate to show you what-for like she's 8 feet tall lol. 

My blood family has never treated me half as well as these ladies do and I am just so blessed to know them and have them in my life! 

So here's to a sneaky surprise!  *shush* no telling!🤫

Edit: She loved it and no one spilled the beans! We got to have a lovely little tea time with some wonderful conversation and some very delicious tea, yummy pastries and little finger sandwiches! She's actually thinking about using the location for her bridal shower 😊"
happy,"
At school I hated working, would much rather be playing sports or video games. Throughout uni whilst I found some topics interesting, I hated any hard graft, would much rather be lounging about. I had kind of just accepted that I would forever just do my job to get paid then rush home at the end of the day. 

My first couple jobs were very much like that. I was there for a pay check, would not spend a second more than I needed to there. 

I’ve just had an incredibly busy/tiring/stressful week, and as I sit slumped on the sofa watching a film I find myself somewhat looking forward to Monday and to getting stuck right back into it? This is a completely alien concept for me and I’m not sure how to process it. I’m incredibly thankful and I just kind of wanted to get it off my chest without appearing like bragging to my friends. 

A) what do I do with this good energy? Do I just accept that I’m lucky and crack on?

B) I wanna hear about others that love their job- not the money or how easy it is, who really loves putting in effort and showing up Monday morning? And to those people how do I stay like this? I don’t want to get burned out I want to be happy going to work when I’m 60"
happy,"Melissa? Are you there?

sadly i did not get the year down, was a bit over 2 decades late! but still this makes me very happy"
happy,She's asleep right now next to me. My phone took a poop so she said that I could use hers so I thought I'd make a post like this. You don't have to upvote I'm just posting it just for the sake of her finding it one day. 
happy,"I’ve been overweight for my entire life, and finally started trying to lose weight in a sustainable way back in December. As of this morning, I have lost 15 pounds! 

I have had trichotillomania (compulsive hair pulling, related to OCD and anxiety) for fifteen years. As of this morning, I have gone THREE DAYS without pulling! 

I’m a high school teacher, and this morning (after a pretty tough year), I found out that I get to teach my dream class next year!

I don’t have a lot of people to tell, but it was a really good day :) "
happy,I (F18) talked to the army three months ago about joining just for the fun of it. I had no idea that I could get trained as an LPN. (I want to be a doctor one day so this will get me started in building my career) I signed my contract at MEPs yesterday. I'm really excited to be able to go to college and be able to move out of my parent's house!! 
happy,"Hi, just posting here because I like the vibe and everyone sub talking about jobs is depressing and bleh. I have a question, I was recently hired into the bank 6 months ago with no prior experience and I am loving it. I recently got a promotion and I'm starting to stress because I don't know where I want this to take me. I'm very excited, as I know I will do very well but I want to try to refine what I want to do so I have more of a direction but have no idea how to find out what I wanna do. Also, how do I relax and enjoy my life, instead of always thinking about work and where I could do better, Thanks!!"
happy,"
So I’ve officially made it a month away from drinking and about 2 months away from morphine. And considering all the shit I’ve been through recently and the fact I was drinking a handle of vodka every school week and every weekend for over a year I am incredibly proud of myself for not relapsing. I went from chugging my last drink in last then 30 seconds to only smoking an 8th in like a week. I’m also kinda happy cuz I just turned 16 and now I don’t have to worry about me being stupid and trying to drink and drive. Honestly all of this only happened because my girl didn’t like me when I was  drunk. and considering I’m not the only one in my family who has had a drinking problem and I’ve seen how alcohol ruined my grandparents marriage and eventually led to my grandfathers death at 45 I honestly feel kinda strong for once."
happy,"in late august/early september me (15m) and one of my friends (15m) decided to fake date each other for fun and after about a week of playful “fake dating” a mutual friend dmed me and told me to message my fake lover, so i did and with some prompting he confessed that he had actually fallen for me and i had suspected thats what this was about (being prompted to message him) and i was incredibly excited, i had only recently come to terms with my sexuality as gay and was more than happy to accept his feelings, we kinda took it slow because i was pretty nervous to say actually romantic things but we are in a happy relationship for a little over 4 months now! this is the longest and healthiest relationship ive been in and i genuinely want to marry this boy. just wanted to ramble about my perfect boyfriend and how we got together


moral of the story: fake date your friend whos knows what will happen 🤭"
happy,"I have the best in-laws, they spoil me more than their own son! I volunteer at a pig sanctuary, so when my MIL saw this she said she just had to get it for me. I’m so lucky 🥰"
happy,"The title says the story , tomorrow is my first day at work ( though it is an internship) and I am so happy that I am finally entering the working life 😁 I just came here cuz I wanted to share it with more people ! "
happy,"I went septic 2 years ago due to a kidney stone that was obstructing my kidneys flows but after almost  3 YEARS (and it growing 2mm) its out due to me going to the ER and getting medicine because I knew something was wrong!

Listen to your body, and advocate as much as you need!"
happy,"And I just...

It feels so good.

Another friend, let's call her M, became super super super close with me over the past 2 months.

Anyway, tonight, my oldest friend (I've known her for like 26 years; she was my first girlfriend at like 13 years old), let's call her A, said she was really jealous about M and I was like why? And she told me she was super possessive of me.

I've always had a thing for A (except while I was in relationships) and I... guess all the signs were there. I mean... the last time we hung out she was grinding her butt all over my leg for like 20 minutes straight while I was chatting with friends at a house party. She also always makes sure to tell me she loves me before we get off the phone and she's not even remotely an affectionate woman.

I cant believe how oblivious I was.. Autism i guess haha

3 months ago I thought I was going to be alone forever. And now this on top of everything else.

Fuck 😊

I'm so happy."
happy,I’m going to be an uncle for the first time and I’m just so excited!
happy,"So I’ve been wanting to be more like my awesome marathon runner Papa. He’s always been a wonderful athlete! Running marathons when he was younger to playing softball now, in his 80’s. He’s the coolest guy, I’m dying to be more like him. Not just physically but emotionally too. He’s always been so chill. 

I set a goal to try to walk five miles every other day just to start, and to my surprise I’ve actually gone and done it! Pokémon GO tracks the duration of my walks and I’ve walked more than thirty miles each week for the past three weeks. I’m over the moon! 🐮 Just wanted to share some happy news. I hope you all have a nice day today!  

"
happy,"Pretty rainy today but that ain't stopping me! Walked the same distance as yesterday but I'll try another mile in a week or so! I appreciate the support of making this a daily thing and i also appreciate all of you who have ""joined"" me in my walking! Love y'all and I'll see you tomorrow!"
happy,"i (f19) am in a long distance relationship with my gf (f22). things are really tight so i thought that maybe i wouldn’t be able to afford to get my gf much for valentine’s day. she calls me goose a lot and i ended up finding a stuffed goose that’s about my height! i also found some of her favorite candies and some face masks that she enjoys for a relatively affordable price.  i’m just super happy i got to get her some meaningful things, even if it’s not much. I included a picture of the goose (i got the largest one) :))"
happy,"Tw - self harm talk 


I used to struggle very heavily with self harm. It used to be an urge and I would just cut and cut. BUT after a while of work and therapy, along with my friends and working on myself. I have now been clean of ANY form of self harm for 7 MONTHS!!! I know that to most people this doesn't seem like much, but as someone who has attempted in the past this is MASSIVE for me and I cried after just thinking about it. I don't even know if this is the right subreddit but I thought it was nice and I wanted to share it somewhere so this is where I picked. :))"
happy,"I never thought giving a gift would make me so happy. I live in India and my best friend always had this big desire to visit a special place for worshipping Krishna. Unfortunately, that place is very far away. But then I found out there is a similar place much closer to where we live, so I decided to take her there as a surprise.

I didn't tell her where I intended to take her. I just asked her when she had her holidays and around christmas we planned the trip. It took 4 hours to reach there and when we were just about to reach I gave her a note saying 'We will visit your favourite place one day soon. Until that time enjoy this little surprise from me'. When we were at front gate and she realized where we were she became so mesmerised. Seeing her so happy I felt very gratified. That was the first time I realized that love is about giving cause the more you give the more blissful you become.

We visited every temple, the people were chanting Hare Krishna and she was enjoying every little thing. She even took some of the soil from there as a memory. Seeing that she loved my surprise there was different level of joy within me and I truly felt what Sadhguru says 'How deeply you touch another life is how rich your life is'."
happy,"It’s not been the easiest, but I have such amazing family and friends that have supported me the whole way. Feeling proud of myself :)"
happy,"I just started a new job 3 weeks ago. On the first day of training there were 2 other people in a group with me. We instantly clicked and have been having lunch together and texting each other everyday since. 

We each are going through breakups and while at different stages of healing, they are just so positive and supportive. It’s been really good for me. They are also both super healthy and workout regularly which is really impressive to me and has motivated me to get off my ass! lol  We even signed up for a hot yoga class this weekend! 🧘‍♀️

We were all texting last night saying how we felt we were supposed to meet one another. Just makes me feel grateful for being able to meet new friends at 43 and especially at a time when my heart is missing who I thought was my person so much. 
"
happy,"When I finally got up the courage to go to the dentist, I discovered that I needed an old crown replaced, 2 fillings, and, worst of all, 2 root canals. I am terrified of drilling and each time I had to go to an appointment over the past few months, I had to steel myself. However, this entire few years that I have gone without seeing a dentist, I knew that it was just a matter of time before I had a major problem, or even caused myself a serious health problem. It was like I had a shadow of worry always hanging over my shoulder, even in happy moments, and I knew the only way to dismiss it was to finally go to the dentist and let them fix every single problem.  

I had been saving up for a new car, so that money is all gone now, but I don’t need a new car the way I need the blissful peace of mind that comes with finally resolving a serious problem that has followed me for years.  

And actually, it ended up being not the worst case scenario. I didn’t lose a single tooth. I didn’t have to get any implants. If I do better at taking care of my teeth going forward, I hope I can keep all of them. And I hope I don’t ever have to do a root canal again. And my mouth feels so much better.  

edit to add: I just want to describe some things that happened during my first appointment. I was so terrified I was trembling violently. During the part where they were examining my teeth, with various sharp implements, every time it hurt so much, I would flinch violently. Tears began to stream from the corners of my eyes. Until finally the dentist said “Do you need a moment?” and I sat up and the tech fetched my water bottle from my backpack. All of this was in the FIRST appointment, and all they were trying to do was find what was wrong, and what needed to be fixed, and I was so afraid, and my injured teeth hurt SO much. It was, all of it, built upon old childhood trauma, drilling when I wasn’t really numb, an elderly dentist chasing me around the chair and then yelling at my mother not to bring me in again if I was too stupid to let him help me.   

Anyway. I somehow made it through. Perhaps that first appointment _was_ the worst. Worse even than the root canals. "
happy,"I (25m) am in a relationship for the first time in my adult life and can not describe how happy I am.

Towards the end of October last year my boss told me that one of my co-workers (23f) who I did also consider a friend had told her she had a crush on me. I admitted that while I had never really considered it before, if she was interested I was willing to give it a go. We started flirting and a couple weeks later we had our first date. 

The funny part is that at the beginning of January my now girlfriend and I were talking and it came out that while we were definitely friends rather than just co-workers at the time, neither of us had considered a romantic relationship until our boss told us both that the other was interested and we realized that our boss had just been bored and decided to play matchmaker. We have since confronted our boss and thanked her for doing what she did.

We are both incredibly happy with our situation now and incredibly grateful to our bored meddling boss for setting us up (and creating two incredibly inefficient employees)."
happy,So today I went for a run. Now when I starred I was doing interval training which I still do but today I made through half my route without getting winded or slowing down to walk. I feel amazing. I'm so happy when I make progress. 
happy,"Even tho it’s quite embarrassing I wanted to share this. This is Caesar my poodle puppy who is ready to greet me early every morning. This means I have to get up and out to walk him first thing, something that I COULD NOT and WOULD NOT ever do before I had him because of my agoraphobia. He has given me more independence and has made me progress so much faster. He even helps with my panic attacks. But most importantly I love him and he makes me happy!"
happy,"I worked all year while doing school (the maximum amount of hours I was allowed to do I did), I worked during all my breaks and I haven't gone on any trips out of state because I wanted to feel financially sane more than wanting to go out. I've been living bill to bill, rent to rent, month to month and sometimes had to borrow to meet the rent (since my pay is bi weekly).

I've been so bitter all year. Initially it hurt that I had to work and do my difficult stem course and worry about feeding myself while all my friends and classmates lived in their lavish apartments close to school as I commuted from far away to save money. But I don't feel bitter anymore!


I know what living month to month feels like so I'm gonna still do max hours of work. But I'm gonna be able to give myself 2 weeks of breaks between semesters now. 


I'm moving in with my boyfriend too which will reduce my rent by so much since we're splitting.

&#x200B;

I'm so happy. I hope no crisis will take away this safety net I have built. I hope that when my parents travel here I can pay for all of their needs. I'm just happy man. Fingers crossed!!

&#x200B;"
happy,"Are they enough?

I moved away from family and friends to another state over 1000 miles away. It’s just my husband, two dogs and me. I work from home. I’m 52 years old and it’s hard to make friends at this age. Is it wrong that I feel content and dare I say happy with the limited companionship? Social media tells me I should have friends to hang out with on a weekly basis. 

I like hanging out at home with my pups and husband. I read and garden. We have fires and cocktails. 

Am I missing out? Should I be trying harder? I do go back “home” twice a year to see family and one or two friends."
happy,"Life update: you may remember me from this post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/b5p72v/comment/ejhehp6/](https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/b5p72v/comment/ejhehp6/)

But so many things have happened since then. You guys truly changed my life at that moment and I wouldn't have even gotten started without you guys. I've been picked up by a small but pretty successful publisher, DYB Publishing, for both my seven book fantasy series and science fiction trilogy.  I also went to my first anime convention last week and almost sold out (despite me almost dying from social anxiety). And I just wanted to come by and thank all of you! Also here are some pictures!

happy,"Yesterday, a mysterious someone left this poster and a bucket of flowers. The number of people walking around with flowers was astounding. Plenty of folks in my hometown needed a little happiness. :)"
happy,"Today's been a really lovely. I felt so at peace handwashing antique quilts in textile cleaner to remove the yellow age stains so they become like new again, just a couple spots need to be patched up and already have some choice fabrics in mind (got some really nice cotton calico prints at a free sale a couple years ago and a few nice quilt squares at a church sale). Save that project for a rainy day. Went out to some yard sales today and got some nice antique furniture for really cheap and some work clothes. I love looking at how they joined wood furniture back then, no nails or screws, just complex wood joinery and yet it's so unbelievably sturdy. The solid cedar wardrobe needs to be stripped, sanded and stained with a wood oil but it's lovely and has a cute little mirror and hanger and everything. I really loved how helpful the gentleman selling it was too. He helped carry the furniture into my vehicle and he just seemed really kind and gentle. His mum raised him right. Something about this being his mum's furniture is bittersweet. That's the wonderful thing about these older pieces, they're loved and I hope whoever takes on these pieces after me, loves them equally as much. I do wonder sometimes who the craftsman is behind all of this. It's kind of paying tribute to his art and how it carries on after death. 😊🥰"
happy,"My boyfriend and I were cuddling yesterday and he told me he wants to be the father of my kids one day. I’ve always wanted a loving and respectful man who would want something long-term with me and I also aspire to be a mother who raises a cute lil family of my own one day, so I was squealing on the inside when he told me this :) I hope everyone and anyone can experience love as amazing as this if not better 🥰"
happy,"I’m kinda lonely in college I didn’t find many good friends here throughout the years, I got good friends back home though but kinda sad I can’t spend it with them bc I feel like 21 is kinda special? Maybe? But here’s to another trip around the sun of life 😄"
happy,Fitting for a family of hobbits.

happy,"My two kids from a previous marriage now have mom, dad, AND papà. They looked so happy during our little ceremony; even my generally stone-faced teenager couldn't help but smile. Husband's parents served as our witnesses, and we had a lovely day together. We also have our honeymoon to Japan in a few weeks, which I'm beyond thrilled about. More than anything, I feel gratitude. For an amazing, intelligent, and funny partner, and for the wonderful and loving papà my kids have gained over the last few years. My life has gone from the very dark place I was born into to this...it feels like a fairytale. I have my partner, my babies (shared time with their dad, but for several months at a time which is great for us with school,) and then university finally, and just generally life is stable and good. I didn't know where else to share but I'm just really happy. :)

Edit: To clarify, we met on reddit 🥰"
happy,"I learned a new word the other day and am practicing it now.

Hurkle-durkle originates from the Scottish language which means to lounge in bed longer than when you should have gotten up.

I think I can be an Olympic class or professional hurkle-durkler.  I've been practicing so long without knowing it that I'm actually a professional my first time trying!!!!   

May everyone have at least one hurkle-durkle day a week."

happy,First week of college my girlfriend broke up with me because she wanted to hookup with a guy she met in class after begging me to come to college with her and being in a relationship with her for a year she successfully hooked up with him and kept me on the ropes for 7 whole months and I developed a pill addiction and asked her for help with it but she didn’t care a month ago I ended things with her it was then she realized she threw me away and took me for granted for that long and wants me back but I know after what she did to me I can’t go back it’s been a month now and I’m very happy I’m talking to a new lady rn and things are going good but why do I feel guilty ending things with her ?
happy,"Sorry for the late post, I was busy today so I didn't get my walk in until 7pm. But I made up for it with a picture of something else other than a view! I walked about 2 miles, mostly because I was given permission to walk around the properties on the hill. 

I've also decided to switch to weekly updates, as I don't want to clog r/happy with just my posts. It's just not fair to other posters. 

I love y'all and if you need anything, a pep talk, walking advice, or just wanna talk please feel free to DM me, as I'm alwaysore than happy to talk. Cheers!"
happy,"I’ve been in for four years, four years since I was seventeen. It’s been an experience and I’m so glad that I can go back home and see my family, my friends, travel more freely, attend university. I’ve never been more satisfied with my position now that this chapter of my life is finally coming to a close."
happy,Not to Jinx myself and I'm knocking on wood. But next week I've been at my job eleven years. It makes me happy because growing up I had learning issues and was in special Ed. And the teachers were not nice. I was told I would never go to college and ide never hold a job. I have so far done both. And I feel..well proud of myself in a way I've beaten odds and expectations. I was told i would be nothing but a failure.
happy,"My husband got a better paying job, I'm getting in shape and plan to get out of debt and finish my Masters Degree. Anyone else feel 2024 is their year??"
happy,"Over the next few days I urge you all to take a break from the news and simply reflect on the blessings in your life and opportunities that may present themselves in the future.

Forget the bad times of 2023, reflect on what you have in your life......your health, a loved one(s), friends or the rich culture around that you may have taken for granted.

See you all next year!  "
happy,"I’m traveling in Korea at the moment.  Japan last week.  Life is good despite all the info to the contrary.  Find time to enjoy and reflect on how far you’ve come.  We are living in the best of times, believe it or not.  Hugs to all. "

happy,"We had our ups and downs throughout the year, but we secured our place in the roll-off for the League Championship. Started off strong and finished strong beating last year’s chanpions. "
happy,"I just feel ecstatic this week full of pride for myself.  I grew up around alot of drugs and awful people, not awful in the sense that they did bad things but awful in the sense they had lost themselves in a pit of drugs and self depreciation.  My mom and my grandma were both addicted to opioid painkillers for like all of my childhood and I never knew my dad so my grandpa raised me and he was a great man he taught me alot of things a dad should like how to shave how to treat people and generally what it means to be a good person.  But nobody lives forever and when he passed things got worse and I was eventually taken by Arkansas CPS when i was 16 in late 2018 and given to my Great Grandma.  Lived with her for a bit then she decided she didn't want me and my oldest sister.  It hurt alot hearing someone just say they didn't want you when you expect them to care for you.  So I was placed in the foster system in January 2019 met lots of good people while I was in the system and I still talk to my foster mom.  I got out of the system in 2022 and left Kansas to come back home to Arkansas and I found myself surrounded by a whole new side of my family my mom had hidden from me my whole life, My Aunt Jamie and her wife Trey helped me get on my feet and my first place.  But me being new to this whole thing after about a year I lost a good job and in turn lost my place.  And then I met my Dad and he's just such a good person who's given me a firm guiding hand in the right direction which I exactly what I needed so now im an Assistant Manager at my local Dominoes and I plan on working here until September or November to say I have a year's worth of Management Experience then looking for a better paying job and this Saturday I'm moving into a new Apartment using all the money I've worked so hard for to save up and I'm just so happy and proud of myself.  And I'm thankful that I got to meet all this family I never knew cared so much about me for so long.  2025 is going to be my year, I hope to finally be able to really worm on myself and keep this winning streak going because this has been the best year or two of my life I'm happier than I've ever been and it's all thanks to my new friends and family. I'm learning to survive and I have to support system I need to finally make myself the person I want to be and I will never take it for granted. "

I hope you y'all have a nice time "
happy,"This is a long, very happy rant. I can't rant out of happiness this hard to anyone in my life rn

I am so happy. I can't stop talking about my glasses and it's probably getting annoying, because everyone has glasses. But I feel like a lot of people just got glasses when they first started needing them and didn't just have terrible vision that was ignored for most of their lives to the point of developing eye problems over it, and then suddenly get it corrected like in an instant, and I literally cannot shut up about it. What I thought was pretty normal vision was actually complete dogshit and now I am seeing things I couldn't even imagine a few weeks ago.

And holy shit. I pretty much immediately got hit with the heavy fist of depth perception for the first time in my life and spent like half an hour touching the sink and putting my hands in the corners of the room because everything was suddenly EXTREMELY 3D. I feel like I am in an actual video game. I used to joke that video games are higher definition than my actual vision but not right now.

Everything is so BRIGHT. Everything is so DETAILED. Grass doesn't all blend together anymore, everything on my shelf is a distinct individual object, I can see a face a few feet away, hell I can read something across the street. It's nuts. Colours are so sharp and saturated now, life isnt a foggy haze around me, everything is in such intense focus and detail I keep just staring at little things and tearing up. 

AND I CAN ACTUALLY READ OH MY GOD. I've been afraid to Crack open a novel because I'm afraid it's going to be too good to be true, but as far as scrolling on my phone, sentences and words are so crisp and distinct. I don't have to hold it at right up to my actual nose, close one eye and squint just to have my eye bounce all over the page and give me a headache after about one sentence. 

And better, I haven't had double vision in days. I used to get it every day like clockwork around 2pm until the end of the day. Since putting on my glasses, I guess my brain just. Isn't trying to mash together two extremely different visual fields anymore and giving up or something (I'm not a doctor, that makes sense to me though)

I'm just losing my mind. I never want to take them off. I have to force myself to take them off at bedtime. I want to order 500 pairs and put them on a special shelf like a shrine lol. I have never been more greatful for anything before.

It's insane how bad I let this get under the guise of ""it's always been like this, it was like this when I grew up, can't imagine it gets that much better than this now."" It's like the Crack in your windshield that you eventually stop noticing until your windshield explodes."
happy," I've been the happiest I've been for at least the past five years. No real complaints, no real worries. I mean, little day to day things like in a sitcom, but nothing crazy. I get up not worried about hating my job, don't think I have any real enemies, have a wonderful family and have the means to take care of them. Not religious either, so this is not fueled by my love for a higher being.

I found what makes me happy and don't really need anything else. Delighted to share my positive vibes if anyone needs some."
happy,"I've been really down the last couple of days. Just sad, crying, hopelessness. But the smallest dumbest thing made me burst out laughing. I was giving someone my work email and they kept getting the letters wrong and I had to correct them and something about them typing BBC instead of VVC made me LOL for real. And I'm feeling a lot better. Nothing like a good laugh to remind you that everything will be okay"
happy,"I'm a minor, just fyi

For the past half of a year I have been in love with my friend. Their kind, and funny, and really sweet, not to mention cute. And I though it was not mutual, I even started telling myself that I just had to get over them, but recently another friend of ours cracked a joke about how they liked me so much, and when said friend left, leaving me alone with them, I asked about it, to which they responded they didn't know. I told them I liked them, and they got so excited, asking me over and over again if I was being for real. They told me so many cute things, like ""you make me feel like I'm so cared about"" and ""you're face- it just makes sense to me."" And we started dating and they tell me how they spend waiting in lines fantasizing about spending time with me. I genuinely didn't know I could be so happy."
happy,"This is my life. I can't share this with anyone without coming off as boastful, but I just needed to put it into words. This is the story of my growth as a person through from being a kid to an adult through a year, from a single drunken realisation.

When I was a kid, I was, and still am, incredibly fortunate. I was born into a financially safe family with loving parents, a cool older brother. I was an athlete as a kid, smart, confident and socially liked. Kind, respectful, 'cool'. Mate's parents loved me, my friends thought I was the shit, everything was perfect. I got older, became a teenager. I had a big friend group, I was good with girls and good at the things I tried. I never tried in school and did well, and I started truly becoming a prick. I was so full of myself. I picked on anyone that was different to me to make my mates or girls laugh, I was crass and rude. I'd spend my life fucking around with my friends, not doing anything of value and arguing with people on the internet to get a rise out of them. I didn't appreciate my parents or my family, I'd show up late to important things and not bother going to things if I didn't absolutely have to. My mates started getting sick of me. My parents started getting sick of me. My brother started getting sick of me.

Then adulthood came. I was 18, I finished school with decent marks, got into a good degree at uni, and started completely letting everything go. For my entire life, everything had been done for me. I'd show up, do the bare minimum, and life started going downhill because of it. I got into a relationship with a girl and interjected myself in her life. I'd try and 'fix' things for her that didn't need fixing, and her resentment grew. She came from a rough house, wasn't mentally healthy and started taking it out on me, verbally and emotionally. My life caught up with me. I was turning in my assignments at the last possible moment, scrapping together the lowest amount of money possible to pay for alcohol, club tickets and petrol, I was putting up with emotional manipulation and hurtful insults from the girl I loved. I stopped going to the gym. I started smoking. I let myself go mentally and physically completely. I gained heaps of weight, picked up terrible habits with everything you can think of. I embraced the full on 'loser' lifestyle. I leeched off my family and made nothing of myself. Me and my ex broke up in a bad way, and I put up with the harassment for months afterwards.

I was a 'yeah I'll get around to it' type of person. I was gonna get my shit together, I was gonna get back to the gym, I was gonna work on myself EVENTUALLY. I was gonna get a tattoo, I was gonna finish uni, I was gonna get a 'real' job. Every day I'd lie to my friends, my family, but most importantly, myself. I'd lie that I was going to get things back on track and start living, but it never happened. I never started anything. I had my hand in a thousand things and the moment I wasn't immediately gratified with a reward, I quit. I was gonna make more friends and go travelling! I was going to get a high paying job with absolutely zero effort! I was so stuck in the mindset of everything being easy and done for me, that I just expected things to work out for me.

At the start of last year, I was a fraction of the human I am now. To cope with how 'hard' life was, I did everything dumb you can think of. I was a 20 year old bloke, depressed, selfish, leeching loser. All I did was party, chat up girls, eat like shit, drink too many beers and smoke too much bud, and ALWAYS fuck off any real work and ambition for a good night with my mates. I had zero self-control, zero idea, zero moderation and idea of where I was going and what I was capable of. No life skills. For Christ's sake, I could barely do my own laundry. My Mum had taken care of almost every tiny aspect of my life and I'd never even appreciated her for it. I remember going to my ex's and barely knowing how to wash dishes because I was that useless in any real life skill. Everything was done for me.

Then things got rough. My dad's heart essentially gave out, my brother who had always been a stalwart, mature and driven bloke had a full blown mental health crisis due to some physical health issues, and my family collapsed. Dad was off work and Mum was taking care of him, my brother was bedridden and lower than any low I'd seen him overcome before. And there I was; sat in my room, taking my life for granted. I was playing games into the late hours, never doing my uni course work and working a casual, extremely low-hour and low paying job, not because I was busy, but because I was lazy and didn't want to face any real work. I'd rather just sit in my room and watch every youtube video and pump as many hours into games as I could, then the weekend would come and I'd be drunk/high for the entirety of it and make stupid self destructive choices. Never saved any money or did anything for anyone farther than what I had to do to consider myself a good person. I was seeing a girl I had no romantic interest in because I was bored, taking her kindness for granted. Absolute rock bottom. My mental illness was out the wazoo. Shit was absolutely brutal and was truly my lowest low.

Then, one day, I was over at a mate's and we were playing poker. I had a smoke in my mouth and 8 or 9 empty beer bottles next to my chair and a fresh one in my hand, hair greasy and out of sorts, basically had my pyjamas on, totally mashed. I looked over at a mate to make a stupid joke and caught a look at myself in the mirror. I was overweight, my skin was a mess, I was borderline unwashed and I absolutely HATED it. I realised in a fraction of a second that all the anger and hurt I was balling up in my stomach wasn't directed to anyone else. It wasn't the people who'd put me down, it wasn't my ex, it wasn't my loving family who I perceived as 'overbearing and annoying', it was me. I'd come from a life of such opportunity and I'd squandered all of it. My life was in shambles and it was MY fault. No one put a drink in my hand or a smoke in my mouth, no one put a gun to my head and stopped me studying and working on myself. I'd done it myself. I was a total dick to everyone around me, even catching the insult to my friend in my throat that wasn't funny in the slightest; just a knee jerk reaction to something he'd said. I was immature in every sense of the word, and I was completely wasting myself, my opportunities and my life.

In that moment, I was truly, truly disgusted with myself. I loathed the life I'd wasted, and then came to another instant realisation. That didn't have to continue. I didn't have to hate myself anymore. I'm young, there was still time to put things in the right place and get it done. I didn't have to keep up with my ex's instagram anymore, I didn't have to drink myself to death to have a good time. I didn't have to spend all of my free time outside of partying playing games and being bored. There was new things to try; a whole life yet lived.

Over the next month, I made changes. I put my study on hold, which was an incredibly hard thing to do. For the first time truly in my selfish life, I sacrificed my own movement forward to take care of the people around me. I got out there, picked up another job. I started trying. I started, very slowly, turning myself back into someone I once was, someone a young me could be proud of. Someone my parents could be proud of. Someone I could be proud of. I stopped drinking for an entire month, which I hadn't done since I'd turned 18. I completely put down the bong. I booked myself into a therapist and paid for it myself, not trying to wrangle money out of my parents to put money into self growth that would go to waste. I wrote down a list of my goals. I signed back up to the gym. I stopped chasing late nights and cheap relationships.

I slipped up at times. Made dumb decisions, I hurt people. But I stopped beating myself up for my own mistakes and trying to blame circumstance or other people. I started holding myself accountable. I started showing regret and appreciation a lot more, I stopped saying 'I'll get around to it'. I started doing.

I started taking care of my dad physically, my brother mentally and giving my Mum a break. I'd clean the house and do the shopping so she could come home from work and just be with my old man. I went outside and learned to properly mow, learned how to hedge, how to weed and lay gravel. I fixed stuff in our house by myself with no direction except for google, I learned how to be financially intelligent, I learned true independence from my family for the first time. I learned that I could laugh louder and bring smile to peoples faces, I learned that within me was the ability to do anything I could put my mind to. I learned that part of my happiness came from spreading joy to those around me and making people smile. I learned to put down the lying, scummy, self loathing part of myself again. The pessimist. I started appreciating the sun more, I started spending more time just helping! I started spending real time with my brother. We became mates again. I started coaching him through his breakdowns and holding him through his panic attacks. I started kissing my mum on the cheek again and bringing my parents a coffee in bed. I started laughing with my friends instead of at them. I started showing pride in my own actions, pride in other's actions. I complimented people's clothes and their laughs, shaking more hands, working harder. I started catching up on all the uni work I'd missed and getting up earlier. I started going for runs. I starting putting greenery on my plate. I started washing up the dishes more, watching movies with my dad when he was awake, or sitting with him while he was reading. I started hanging out with my Mum and treating her to coffee and lunch, getting her out of the house. I started driving my friends around while they drank and I just smiled and laughed and got on the AUX for them. I started writing music and stories again. I put more effort into DnD characters, I stopped being embarrassed about stupid things. I started SMILING. Really, actually, SMILING.

I was going out, and I was partying, but I was drinking within my wallet and I wasn't so miserable when I was mashed. I started dancing and walking girl's to their front doors instead of just dropping them off. I started connecting with the kids at work and I started babysitting my cousins. I went over to my grandparent's house and fixed their technology, spending time with them. I stopped trying to what I considered cool and just starting doing fun shit. I tried bouldering. I tried surfing. I tried playing club footy again. I started hanging out with new people, people completely different to me. I started learning. I started to feel passion for things again. I started training muay thai because I'd always said I would.

I started DOING.

Now, here I am, emotional late at night and just so fucking HAPPY. I'm single and so content with my life and so busy that I have no interest in being in a relationship, I am overwhelmed with pure joy and so truly happy with who I am. I've lost weight. I don't smoke or vape anymore. I'm excited to wake up and go to work and come home and give my mum a hug and hang out with her while she cooks dinner. My dad's back to almost full strength and he's his old happy self, my brother is medicated and learning to become himself again. I spend less time in my room. I spend less time existing and more time living. Me and my friends are even actually going travelling next year, because I'll be graduating! We're doing a roadtrip across America and I'm so excited. I'm going to have so much fun and meet so many new people. Then I'm gonna come home, continue the life I'll be putting on hold temporarily. I'm gonna get a decent job and do my best. 

There will be pitfalls, I'm going to have bad days and meet bad people, have bad experiences but I'm stronger now than I ever was before. I can cook for myself. I can clean for myself. I help out around the house. I show my love to people. I write my feelings down and create stories that I share with my friends. I found my passion for being alive again. I've become a rock for someone very close to me that I work with every day to get her life back on track.

Don't get me wrong, I haven't fixed everything in a year. I still struggle with staying ontop of my newfound responsibilities and sometimes I'm lazy and sometimes I make dumb decisions, but I am leaps and bounds ahead of where I was. I am always trying to improve, and I can only go up from here.

One day, I'm going to be even happier than I am now. I'm gonna have a wife and kids that I can support through anything they go through, and I'm going to be a fuckin' great dad and dude in general. God fucking damn. I am absolutely ecstatic to be alive.

Life's good in the sunshine.

I had someone end up DMing me about this post talking about their own alcohol and nicotine intake and I just wanted to throw this on the end; there's nothing wrong with partying and having fun. I still go out and get pissed and what not, but the way I was doing it at the start of last year was simply as a coping mechanism. I was completely out of moderation and completely out of my head, and I was way overdoing it. There's nothing lame about getting drunk and having a good time, as long as you're doing so healthily and being safe! Everything in moderation."
happy,"A few days ago my co worker complimented me on my hair. She said that it's in perfect condition and that she loves it.
Yesterday I met up with my dearest friends, and my friend's girlfriend told me how she was chatting with her friend some time ago, and they both agreed on how I looked like I came straight out of a movie last time we met.
Ngl, lately I didn't feel good about my appearance, so this really lifted my spirit. I thought I was going to melt both of these times lol.
"
happy,"awww, thank you to whoever gave me gold! 


I'm trying to respond to everyone because I love you all for taking the time to comment."
happy," I got both a new laptop, and a PS5! I came into some money recently so I decided to treat myself. I needed a new laptop for school I just started at a university, and a PS5 so I can play the new Spiderman game! I have wanted a PS5 for nearly 3 years now, and it is finally mine. I also bought my textbooks for school as well. I still have a lot of money, but I will not go overboard. I will spend only what I need. I can buy lunch this week at school, and fix my bike but thats it. I need to open a savings account online and I will just put a bunch of it in there. "
happy,"I was being intimate with a white guy and I’m an awkward person so I said I had “hair extensions” and he didn’t mind. He didn’t care at all. He treated me like a normal person… he even touched my head gently a couple of times which made my hairstyle a bit messy but nothing bad happened.

I’m young and the reason I wear wigs is I don’t want to hear damage my real hair :3"
happy,"After going through so much school, putting out so many applications, I was offered my dream role right after graduation and I am so excited and happy I can’t even sleep! Really just wanted to share how at peace and grateful I’m feeling in this moment :) "
happy,Started the year making better changes. Ive lost 19lbs in total since January.

happy,"
Started a new job in February and became fast friends with Amanda. Her friendship means the world to me. Even though she is 18 years younger than me. We just love being friends. Yesterday we got our nails done and had dinner and drinks. 
I laughed so much my cheeks hurt. ☺️😊
We even got drinks that look like us 😂🤣"
happy,"hi- new-ish to reddit but just wanted to say that i’m happy with where i am in life right now. from last august-the end of the year i had no job and bills were draining my savings. 
after spending so much during the holidays, i NEEDED to get a job after the new year. it became my unspoken resolution. so after my guests left, i started applying. 
now, here I am, a SOLID paycheck in. PLUS i’m supporting a super cool small business!
i can’t wait to start saving up again. last year was rough. 
cheers! stay happy!"
happy,"i do some challenge to keep living. there’s a thing as “tell your family “i love you”

i never had a family and ppl i knew was very much toxic and wanted to control me VERY VERY much

so i say “i love you” to my friends, they my family. no matter if we talk every day, once at week or if i see them once at month

you all my family. and i say, we says “we loves you”

don’t know if it’s counts then, but “family” is someone who make me to feel safe, love and accept me. not someone who controls me, insults and makes me to cry

so, yeah, we love you all and we happy to say it "
happy,"Today I turned 33.  My boyfriend (33M) decided to take me on a small trip to a forest an hour away that he knows is one of my favourite places. 
Things were weird between us the the last couples of weeks but I was happy that we took the trip.
We walked through the woods and I was walking ahead of him and he called out my name. I asked him whatif everything is okay while still looking straight ahead. He asked me to turn around. There he was, holding a ring in his hands, smiling at me and he popped the question. 
I said yes. 
I still can't believe it happened .
I can't believe I'm saying this but I'm engaged and this is most definitely the best birthday I've ever had."
happy,"this morning, my boyfriend had to get up before i did. our room was kinda cold so he put his blanket on top of me so i had two blankets and i was soooo warm and comfy :’) (we sleep with separate blankets because we both tend to pull it away from each other in our sleep when we share one lol)

he knows i was really anxious about going to work today so he got me a cup of coffee and brought it to me at work before he headed to work himself. i feel so happy i could cry. he takes such good care of me and i really couldn’t ask for anyone better. he’s my whole world :)"
happy,"First there's A, she's been my number one bestie since we were 7! Me and her get together to watch bullshit reality TV and talk major shit about the men. She loves videogames and she 100% completed breath of the wild and working her way through the new one. She loves her younger brother and takes him on as many vacations as she can. She puts together the most perfect for you, beautiful thoughtful gifts which she presents for you artfully. She has a talent at art and also interior design and her place is stylishly decorated and immaculately clean. Her passion lies in the Library though and she's almost finished with her masters in library science while working full time as a receptionist but soon she'll be a librarian. She's also super fucking funny. When we get together it's allllways laughing.

Then there's B, she's only like a genius scientist and professor with a perfect SAT score who just landed a job at NASA working from home. ALSO she runs marathons even though she got long COVID and has heart problems now. Her goal is still to run in every state and she's still working her way through it. She also skiis, roller skates, rock climbs, and has completed iron man triathlons. On top of that she can also draw and recently she made her own stickers of famous rock formations (shes a geologist). She's the most emotionally intelligent human I know and crafts everything she says with the most delicate tactful gentle thoughtfulness without sugarcoating anything and tells you things to challenge your ideas and potentially harmful or toxic thought processes. She is also a good baker and sends me cookies in the mail a lot!

Then there's C, he's probably the most interesting dude I know although it took him two years of talking to me every day to actually open up about the history of his life. He's been to jail a few times for various things and he told me all about the people there and most of them were ok guys who just ran amock and got themselves in trouble (except for theives who were all around no good people) he's been a chef in fancy restaurants but he is keen on languages and very knowledgeable about them particularly those from the middle east. He originally wanted to be an academic until life took a turn. When he was younger he did martial arts, tended to carnivorous plants, was part of the orchid society, and went out into the wilderness to hunt rocks a lot. He got into bad accidents and was badly injured so now he can't really do the stuff he used to love. It makes me sad. But he's super funny in the most imaginative quirky way. And no one has ever made me laugh in quite the same way.

Then there's well, the other C. He's a young thing. He's a bright person with a promising future. He's in medical school studying to be a surgeon and he's recently gotten his masters degree in the top of his class. He loves videogames and he's quiet, reserved, values manners but he's not afraid of dancing. He loves a good party and night out. When I went to the uk and visited him, he showed me some of the castles in Wales of which he is very proud. He has a strong sense of patriotism about being Welsh. He is the most different from me of all of my friends from two totally different upbringings and worlds but somehow we never run out of things to talk about. When I get in my dramatic moods, He has a way of saying just the perfect matter of fact thing to drop me down to earth and I laugh as I fall. He is a complete nerd to the core but he has a little bit of a charming cockiness and confidence that makes me love the hell out of him.

I have a bunch more friends but if I told you about them all then this would be insanely long! So I just talk about the closest ones. "
happy,"I am working out and feeling great.  I have a job that I enjoy.  My marriage is better than it ever has been.  My relationship with my kids is better than ever.  After so many years I am in a good head space.

Last year I almost killed myself several times and everything seemed hopeless.  

But now colors seem brighter.  Food tastes better.  It’s great to wake up to a new day every day."
happy,"Even tho it’s quite embarrassing I wanted to share this. This is Caesar my poodle puppy who is ready to greet me early every morning. This means I have to get up and out to walk him first thing, something that I COULD NOT and WOULD NOT ever do before I had him because of my agoraphobia. He has given me more independence and has made me progress so much faster. He even helps with my panic attacks. But most importantly I love him and he makes me happy!"
happy,"I just got the best news!!!

After months of waiting, many tests, background checks and a fun 4 hour long psych eval with even more tests involved…

I got offered a job as a County Detention Deputy!!!!

It’s almost double the yearly salary I have been getting for the last few years!

This is fantastic news!!!!"
happy,"It’s the little things sometimes. lol 
*no body shaming plse, i know im thick and im ok with it*"
happy,"I’ve been overweight for my entire life, and finally started trying to lose weight in a sustainable way back in December. As of this morning, I have lost 15 pounds! 

I have had trichotillomania (compulsive hair pulling, related to OCD and anxiety) for fifteen years. As of this morning, I have gone THREE DAYS without pulling! 

I’m a high school teacher, and this morning (after a pretty tough year), I found out that I get to teach my dream class next year!

I don’t have a lot of people to tell, but it was a really good day :) "
happy,"The title says the story , tomorrow is my first day at work ( though it is an internship) and I am so happy that I am finally entering the working life 😁 I just came here cuz I wanted to share it with more people ! "
happy,"Sorry for my bad english. I am a 23 year old guy, i work as a security guard in south america and live far from my family. I have an older sister (28 and works as a party organiser) and a younger brother (9 almost 10) who i love more than myself, i chat from time to time with my older sister since we both know the other is probably busy, on the other hand i play videogames with my brother almost every day and since he is young i play better than him (im not the best but i have been playing for many years now)we have tons of fun and he gets very sad when i have to leave, he joined my discord server along with my friends who are around my same age and he try to keep up with us as much as he can (i gifted him ""ForHonor"" and he is very good at it). Yesterday my older sister asked me about my pfp on discord (an ia image a friend made for me combining my gamertag ""turtle"" and a spacemarine from 40k) so i told her and she asked for the original picture, so i sent it to her along with some pther similar ones. When i sked what they were for she told me that our brother wanted a birthday party... and the theme was me... i expected a spiderman party or something like that. I cant belive how much that little guy loves me and looks up to me. He makes me the happyest brother."
happy,"I saw an FZR400 at a bike show last year and knew that it was my bike. I needed one for when I passed my A2. I was told to try a bike I could ""fit on"", and to get something smaller like my boyfriend's CBR400RR. But I got what I WANTED, not what I felt I had to settle for. And now I've started riding it on the road, I can confidently say that I'm so incredibly happy and proud of myself for getting the bike I wanted 🥰"
happy,"I got the Sony WH-1000XM4’s and they’re so amazing. The sound quality is so nice and I can’t get over the noise cancellation feature. Everything is so quiet and I feel so much calmer. Noises put me on edge sometimes when I’m overwhelmed (often), so they have just helped a lot. :D"
happy,"Got paid for my voice acting today!!!!

I AM SO HAPPY!!! I got paid for doing voice acting work—my very first paid VA work of the year! It wasn’t much but it makes me very happy! Makes me feel like I’m doing something right!! I only said a few lines, haha!! BUT STILL!!!!!"

happy,"I (25m) am in a relationship for the first time in my adult life and can not describe how happy I am.

Towards the end of October last year my boss told me that one of my co-workers (23f) who I did also consider a friend had told her she had a crush on me. I admitted that while I had never really considered it before, if she was interested I was willing to give it a go. We started flirting and a couple weeks later we had our first date. 

The funny part is that at the beginning of January my now girlfriend and I were talking and it came out that while we were definitely friends rather than just co-workers at the time, neither of us had considered a romantic relationship until our boss told us both that the other was interested and we realized that our boss had just been bored and decided to play matchmaker. We have since confronted our boss and thanked her for doing what she did.

We are both incredibly happy with our situation now and incredibly grateful to our bored meddling boss for setting us up (and creating two incredibly inefficient employees)."
happy,"

My professor had embarrassed me in front of the whole class because I did not know one answer. He started asking me my name and throwing comments about how I don't know anything and all. He made me stand in front of everyone. Nevertheless, I, someone who's suffering from anxiety disorder and severe anxiety, someone who gets embarrassed so very easily, for the first time, did not get embarrassed. 

I was pretty chill tbh. I did not have a raised heartbeat, I did not feel extremely sad, I did not panic, I might have had a few tics but that's it. After he left, I just went about doing my job and honestly I was impressed with myself. Idk whether this happended because I have a bigger embarrassing situation/trauma to deal with such that this felt so small or because I was already tired of everyone's sh!t. 

It happened and I'm honestly kinda happy."
happy,"And I rigged it up to open with a fake book. This is something I've always, always wanted, and it makes me ridiculously happy to have finished the project. Downstairs is my game room, with old consoles, my gaming PC, and tons of nerd stuff like Lego sets and Star Wars and Star Trek paraphernalia."
happy,I remember just a few months ago I couldn't even do 10! Let alone get down and do some more afterwards!
happy,"It was just a passing comment during a phone call. To be honest, I kind of forgot I even mentioned it . Today I found a package on my doorstep.


Still can't figure out if it's a cat or a rabbit. There are two modes, rainbow and normal light. What should I name it?"
happy,"I actually have a small business based on that. I sell home baked goodies around the holidays. I know my baking, it's good since I get so many customers I have to refuse the newer ones. It can't be otherwise, I use high quality ingredients and respect de recipe religiously. 

I've got compliments before but never from my friends. Not from my past friends or boyfriend. At least nothing more than ""yeah it's fine"" or ""it's good"" and that after insisting to take a bite. I remember I'd be so discouraged when my ex would prefer a burnt brownie over at least trying something I made. 

So yesterday we were at the canteen talking about small businesses. I never mentioned I had one. My friend sujested I should start one since my baking is so good. She said I'd make her so happy when I invited her over for dinner. She even has some pictures marked as favorite in her phone. She then said she never tried something like it till then. I can't remember all of it but she continued praising it to my other friend. 

I am so lucky having around people that genuinely love me! It really felt sincere. For the first time from a friend and not a customer."
happy,12 years ago we met in a psych ward after we had both tried to rage quit the planet. We've been together ever since!
happy,"Today is the day my life will change FOREVER!!!!

Even as a welder, the most I have ever made doing back breaking work was $20.60 an hour. I currently make $18.22 an hour as a lead IT processing technician. Since 2021, I have been going to school for an A.A.S in multimedia/web development. I joined this company in 2022 and worked up to a lead IT processing technician. And today I was just offered a software developer job for $50,000 a year.

I wont lie, yes, I worked INCREDIBLY hard. I am in the honors society as the VP of communications and public relations for our school chapter. I have maintained a 4.0 GPA (I am graduating in May, I have 2 classes left that I am currently taking) and am so close to graduating with highest honors in my community college. I won an award last year in our state that only 55 students out of 200,000+ community college students called the All-State Academic Team and won a scholarship for Women in STEM. I am a very ambitious and have strived so much through this

BUT, I would have not had this job opportunity if I didn't have luck on my side. Working at this company, I found out they have a software developer team, and did my best to network with them and the adjacent IT team since I started. I had people who I made friends with who spoke my name when the software developer team asked about possible internal candidates. Just like it was luck for them that they actually had an internal employee who lives close enough to their facility who just happens to be going to school for web development, I just so happen to be lucky to work at a place where I could even move up like this.

There were 192 candidates, some of them being other internal employees. And I got it. me. I can't believe this.

I WANT TO CELEBRATE AND SCREAM TO THE ROOFTOPS"

I was able to go back to school and I went from a 36 waist to a 30. I later gave up sodas and energy drinks, but alcohol was the tough one. Two years!!!"
happy,"2 little stories in 1
My daughter Ahsoka who is 14m the other day was drawing on her pad, she showed the drawing to us and we applauded it. My husband then wrote her name on it and she pointed to the A and said A. She then brought it to me and said here A and pointed it out for me

The other day I was making her eggs and she pointed to it and said bird.

happy,"It took a lot of saving, moving things around financially, and sacrificing. I’m looking to improve my finances (and my life) in the future, but it’s good to have hope for once. Really was worried I’d miss the deadline. 

Sorry, I known I’ve been a problem , and I have no one who really cares enough in my life to share this with. Thank you guys for allowing me."
happy,"After 3-4 years of increasing exercise intolerance, I was diagnosed with a heart problem (SVT) 3 months ago. I'm only 40. At the time I could barely walk for 5 minutes. After medication I was up to 15 minutes walking in December. On Saturday, I completed a 2 mile walk outside (normally a big migraine trigger)! I haven't felt this good in 18 years! And the walk was for migraine awareness and education, so I learned about advocacy programs! This is a huge accomplishment for me and I am so incredibly happy. I'm actually tearing up just thinking about it! Now I can work on weight loss and socialize more, it's been absolutely life-changing."
happy,"So I’ve been wanting to be more like my awesome marathon runner Papa. He’s always been a wonderful athlete! Running marathons when he was younger to playing softball now, in his 80’s. He’s the coolest guy, I’m dying to be more like him. Not just physically but emotionally too. He’s always been so chill. 

I set a goal to try to walk five miles every other day just to start, and to my surprise I’ve actually gone and done it! Pokémon GO tracks the duration of my walks and I’ve walked more than thirty miles each week for the past three weeks. I’m over the moon! 🐮 Just wanted to share some happy news. I hope you all have a nice day today!

happy,"

My professor had embarrassed me in front of the whole class because I did not know one answer. He started asking me my name and throwing comments about how I don't know anything and all. He made me stand in front of everyone. Nevertheless, I, someone who's suffering from anxiety disorder and severe anxiety, someone who gets embarrassed so very easily, for the first time, did not get embarrassed. 

I was pretty chill tbh. I did not have a raised heartbeat, I did not feel extremely sad, I did not panic, I might have had a few tics but that's it. After he left, I just went about doing my job and honestly I was impressed with myself. Idk whether this happended because I have a bigger embarrassing situation/trauma to deal with such that this felt so small or because I was already tired of everyone's sh!t. 

It happened and I'm honestly kinda happy."

happy,"So I've worked for getting on 6 years now 

Been senior support for about 3-4 years. Which involves working 24 hour shifts 

For the last year or so I've been doing a lot of the manager work without the extra pay, this is because the current deputy was not really able to do the tasks 

Well I was having a bit of a moan over the Easter bank holidays because I had finished three 24 hour shifts when the regional manager started sending me a series of tasks for some reason (my bosses boss) and I did it all promptly while moaning at myself for being a push over 

Turns out the regional manager then asked my boss why I'm not the deputy as I seem better for the role.

This lead to a discussion with the current deputy who said that she is more than happy to step down from the position for me to take over 


So I'm happy to have gotten recognition from someone high up the chain but also I will now only be working one 24 hour shift a week and will have 16 hours office hours throughout the week 

Also I still get a pay rise of course aha "

happy,"I remember getting a notif, looking at my phone, then freaking my family out cuz I just suddenly started jumping up and down yelling 12 DOLLARS! 12 DOLLARS! 😂

I really came a long way with working on music, putting my heart into beats just to make people dance and forget about whatever troubles them, so seeing people begin to support me made me feel happy beyond words.

Finally I can consider myself an actual artist, not just a hobbyist making music for fun, but an actual artist that was capable of inspiring others.

I never thought I'd make it to this point, I know it's a very small win, but its the first step towards many other milestones yet to come.

I have many people to thank, the yt community and soundcloud, but I think Id be years behind if it werent for niche communities on reddit supporting me all the way through.

Its only January and it's already a big year for me ❤️"

happy,"Today marks 1 year of not experiencing a panic attack. 🥹 Mine were severe - included vomiting, heart irregularities, tremors, sweating, a fleeting feeling, and occasionally paralysis. I felt as though I would never be free of these, until I moved and surrounded myself with lovely, caring individuals. I have not had one since and I want to jump around in happiness. My mental health was declining a few years back and now I feel like it might be at its positive peak which I’m eternally grateful for. This past week especially I’ve felt an overwhelming sense of peace. Just wanted to post in case anyone else is suffering, I still get anxiety but from all the work ive done and being in the right place has helped so much and the anxiety is very minor. 🙌🏼💕"
happy,"Got my dog a toy today at a local ranch supply store. This was supposed to be the be all end all toy for destructive dogs. She managed to tear chunks out of it in 5 minutes flat. I wrote the company and said nice try, but it just didn't hold up. Company wrote back and said that only about 5% of dogs globally could defeat their rubber toys. As my puppy was one of those 5%, would I allow her to become a tester for their company? Heck yes, I'll let her do that. Whether they pay me, or whether they just send free toys, it's still a win for me and my American Bully XL.

ETA, this was an off brand toy, not the well known super duty one."
happy,"I posted something in this sub a little less than 6 months ago after being clean for 2 weeks (I deleted the post for unrelated reasons) and while I got a lot of support I also got a lot of crap because it was ""only two weeks, come back when you have actually achieved something"".  Well, [here I am](http://imgur.com/gallery/ZDd7cMS), 6 months later, still clean, recently engaged, just got into a computer programming program, and have never been happier.  I just resolved my legal issues last week, actually have a savings of more than $2K, am rebuilding relationships with my family members and have nothing but optimism and hope for the future I never bothered to think about before.

Just wanted to use today to send out a PSA to anyone struggling with addiction - it can and DOES get better.  I am here for anyone that needs support.

I would always have to buy multiple shein clothes to find something that would fit me. 
Yes plus size exists but I’m one size too small for plus size and one size too big for XL.

Yesterday I went to a shop and found 3 dresses in the style I love 
Which fit me perfectly and had every colour and pattern I wanted I bought 3. But I might god back and get some more. 

I might not be so exciting for others but for me, it made me feel so beautiful and accepted and just happy. "

I don't really have friends or family to talk about it with so l'm posting here if that's okay. Started from an entry position analyst to engineer in 5 years, now I'm here after 4 more years. I don't have my parents anymore so I guess I'll look for phrase on Reddit 🩷"

happy,"Ill try to be short and sweet, but basically I mentioned to my boyfriend, close friend of two years boyfriend for almost one year, that I'd really love a prom-posal for our senior year since I've never experienced one and it's a once in a lifetime kinda thing for us.

It was a while ago and I assumed her forgot because his schedule with school, sports, gym, etc has him running around. I wasn't even upset and chose to keep it to myself since I know his life is already hectic and didn't want to feel like I was pressuring him.

Well today we were in my room relaxing, I bought some small Lego sets to do, before we started building them he told me if I wanted to see a card trick he just learned.

He dabbles in card tricks and magic, when we first met he did a lot of magic for me, I love watching these tricks to this day. He sat me down next to him and started going on about Royal flush being the best hand in poker while doing the trick for me. I was confused but going along with it and before I knew it he said ""You know what else would be the best, you going to prom with me"" and in front of me the royal flush hand with heart cards with will you go to prom with me on the cards.

I'm heavily emotional and started bawling my eyes like a baby cause he caught me off guard and I didn't know what to say but he reminded me I had to say Yes while hugging me lol.

Regardless, I'm still tearing up over it still cause I can't believe how great of a guy he is and I adore every nerdy, geeky ounce of him.

I just wanted to share this because even though I know it's probably some silly high school romance I still feel like the luckiest person in the world.

Hope you're all having a good day or night and I wish the best for all of you who took time to read this sappy stuff :)"

I've been in a really good mood lately. 

I just had a woman hit on me for the first time ever the other day. I was super nervous, but it left me feeling amazing.

And recently I've somehow (through no real effort on my part) managed to become surrounded by very thoughtful, kind, and genuine people.

I've felt more at ease with my life in general.

It almost feels like my world turned around on it's own, and it brought a lot of joy into my life."

happy,"I quit my job but now worried about money

Quit my job, but worried about money.

I had to do something very hard today. I had to quit my job. It was not a decision I took lightly. Unfortunately it was my first real job and it was sponsored by vocational rehab, which makes me feel bad about quitting. However, I need to prioritize my mental health. I am a 25 year old individual living with multiple disabilities including type 1 diabetes, adhd and anxiety. The job was causing me a lot of stress and anxiety. I spent 4 hours at the therapy office yesterday. They are also adjusting my anxiety medication, I’m still testing adhd meds. I would like to work but I’m not sure what I want to do. Sitting around and collecting disability is not an option. There has to be something im good at. Both my boss and vocational rehab are proud of me for prioritizing my mental health. However, I am still worried about money, despite the fact that I live with my parents. If I don’t work, I won’t be able to have an income. Money is a big stressor in my life. And I’m also trying to not feel like a failure. Maybe I can craft or sell something on etsy. Or freelance/gig work. There has to be something I’m good at. I’m just not sure what. My plan for now is to priorize my mental health, and I asked my therapy office if I was able to come in twice a week so we shall see what they say. I’m probably not the first one to quit my job due to stress. But I’m afraid I’m
The first one to quit their first job. Thank you for taking time to read this post. It was very hard for me to write."

Now, by a chance opportunity, I started a new job alongside my studies for a company in an industry that I love to death (it’s a type of sports). 

I love the people I work with, my office is super nice, and the work is really interesting and fulfilling. I’m actually genuinely excited to grow and learn and forge my career and I am so grateful for the opportunity!

I woke up pretty late but was so happy and did all the chores then got ready. I feel at peace, no pain, no stress, no regrets, just pure serenity. I just needed to share it becos this is rare. I don't feel the best these days so i'm very grateful to be happy today all becos i'm home, sweet home, sweet parents.

Finally decided I was tired of being a loser, so went to a local gaming tournament and it was amazing.

I talked to some old faces I recognized and even bonded with them even more then usual. I met some new people and I even got some complements on how good I was playing my certain character.

Overall it was so nice to interact with other people even though I was still nervous and self concerned about my appearance and everything, but this experience has convinced me to be more social. I even got invited to play in someone's dorm if I ever wanted to.

I stopped going cause people told me it was lame, and it made me even more depressed and self conscious about it. But I'm glad I'm gonna participate in more."

So I haven't shot in years because its so hard. 

I decided I needed a new hobby that got me outside so I started practicing left handed. After an hour or so I had the gun sited in. The tree is 75 freedom units away. I taped it so I could see if the pellet hit or just took the bark away. 

The second pic is me trying to hit the ribbon, then trying to hit the same hole. Didn't work.  You can see the 2nd small nick. That was from 30 fu's free hand.  The hits on the  post were my next two shots from 100fu's leaning against the outhouse. Trying to hit the stick, then hit the same pellet spot.

For context on this, my finances got really messed up by a combination of the great recession and my husband passing away in 2007-2008.I started with almost nothing except for my kids and my job skills. I slowly rebuilt my life and finances step-by-step.

I had a low interest rate, but I wanted to pay off my home loan since retirement is not too far away. I have a few more years to top off my savings then I can pull the plug on my career.

I set a goal for myself to pay off my house and this morning I called the bank and did it. So happy that this long stretch of frugality finally paid off!"
happy,"I (30f) have been married to my wonderful husband for 4yrs and we dated for 2 before getting married. My in-laws have been wonderful to me the entire time. My FIL is like a second father and my MIL is like the mother I never had. Through the duration of my relationship with my husband, I have also been helping him heal his relationship with his parents, i.e making sure boundaries are maintained and communication lines remain open and honest whilst still being kind and considerate. 

My father suddenly passed away about a month ago and it's been really difficult as it was very unexpected but my husband, my friends and my inlaws have really rallied around and made sure I am okay. I've spoken to my husband and my inlaws and it has been decided that they will move in with us into my father's house to 1: help us with some bills and maintaining my father's property and 2: help them because they do not own the place they live now and will need some help as they are getting closer to retirement age. 

My FIL is disabled and on SSA benefits. I am also trying to get disability as I have not been able to work in almost 2 years due to a variety of health issues. My FIL has been so understanding and helpful with tips and tricks on how to do things around the house while chronically in pain or what processes are helpful in going through the disability thing. My MIL has been a real trooper through all of this and has helped keep me grounded as well. My husband is actually excited to live with his parents again because while I understand that his relationship with his parents is completely different than what I had with my dad, I don't want him to go through what I'm going through with any regrets and such. 

It just feels like a spotlight in a very dark time and I really love my husband and my in-laws. Even my brother in-law and future sister-in-law have been super amazing and accommodating and kind. I really love the family I married into and l hope they know I love them too."
happy,"I love my profession but i absolutely hate my job and workplace for a number of reasons that I wont bother talking about. But today was one of those days that people just make me and my heart smile. At my PM shift today a man and two girls (they looked 4 and 6, I was not very sure) came into the pharmacy and handed me one prescription. The smaller one literally said “doctor, you’re so cute” (im not a doctor but i appreciated the compliment). Thought I heard her wrong so I told her to repeat herself and it made me really happy that I giggled under my mask and couldnt stop smiling. While they were waiting for their prescription filled, the older sister said it was cold and the younger offered her jacket and started taking it off and putting it on her which i thought was extremely sweet. They were sitting and talking, their dad just hugging them. When I finally dispensed her medications, the older one said “thank you, bye, cute doctor”. Their dad just laughed at the whole thing but I feel like I have to credit good parenting. This has to be the most wholesome interaction."

happy," Last summer, there was a fat bumblebee hanging around in my neighbor's yard. My mom and I would talk to it whenever we went outside and he/she was there. The bumblebee would buzz towards us in a non-threatening way, back and forth, back and forth, almost dancing in a happy manner. This spring, another bumbly-bee is doing the same actions! This can't be the same bee (unless it's a queen?), but maybe said bumble passed the knowledge of me and mom being friendly.

When i brought up how much i appreciated fighting him (it sounds dumb but you know haha), he said he agreed, but no one else really liked to anymore, even his sister. After that, he said something along the lines of “i think I’m kind of like a big brother to you” and that made me really happy because although i wouldnt realistically call him that ive always seen him in a similar light and as a role model

anyone else love wrestling your friends?"
happy,"I want to reciprocate with a meal subscription because he eats to live on weekdays(mainly due to work) but I want to change things up so ideas are welcome! Also, how do people keep the sparks alive when they are physically away from their partners? "
happy,"I recently did a purge of all negative thinking, embracing only positive thinking. And it's the most rewarding thing I ever did.

Being as reflective, critical, and analytical as I am, I hit some roadblocks that made me consider if I should balance the positivity with negativity for a complete perspective. But the results are in, from experience I can see that I live my best life when I'm positive minded, peaceful, healthy, drug-free smoke-free and alcohol-free, vegan, happy, kind, and compassionate.

I recommend a great book that helped me find this lifestyle called The Power by Rhonda Byrne. It's about the law of attraction and the power of love to put yourself on a frequency to receive happy things, events, people, and experiences.

The momentum just keeps building and I keep getting happier.

I also learned that life is easy this way! I used to thrive off the thrill of challenges and overcoming difficulties, but I'm even happier when everything is smooth and easy.

I'm looking to make friends who are also living the happy life, so feel free to DM me 🕊️"
happy,"Growing up I was very thin, but in 2020 I got diagnosed with PCOS I went from 64kgs to 87 kgs over night making all my clothes tight and impossible to wear. I developed and still have body dysmorphia. 
I would always have to buy multiple shein clothes to find something that would fit me. 
Yes plus size exists but I’m one size too small for plus size and one size too big for XL.

Yesterday I went to a shop and found 3 dresses in the style I love 
Which fit me perfectly and had every colour and pattern I wanted I bought 3. But I might god back and get some more. 

I might not be so exciting for others but for me, it made me feel so beautiful and accepted and just happy. "
happy,"(Just to preface this, it happened yesterday, and I wrote it yesterday, so it’s in present tense, but happened yesterday)

So I have a lot of very noticeable self harm scars on my legs. Especially my right thigh. They’re basically all over, and pretty close to my knees. If I wear shorts, they’re extremely visible. Today, it was 85 degrees, and I also am in track and field.

I was super super nervous about wearing shorts to school today, because it’d really be the first time anyone would have seen my scars, and I was just freaking out. The day had gone pretty good, 2 girls asked me what happened to my leg, I just said “it’s not important” and they left it at that.

Then, at the end of track practice, a guy a couple grades older than me comes up to me, and says “hey, amazing-flute-piano, are those scars?” As he gestures towards his own leg. Internally, I’m dying. Like I’m soooo nervous for what he’s about to say.

I just say “yea, they are”. Then he says “I think you’re so incredibly brave for wearing shorts. That takes a lot of courage.” And I just thanked him.

I also smiled. I did more than smile. I cried. I started crying from the sheer gratefulness and gratitude I felt. I started crying because I never expected those words to come out of anyone’s mouth, let alone another high schoolers. I started crying because that meant so much to me. It made me feel so happy. It truly did. It made me feel like I wasn’t alone, and that not everyone will judge me. It made me feel proud, and not ashamed.

Tomorrow, I have a class with him, and I’m going to make sure that I thank him again, because he deserves it. 🤍"
happy,That’s all. I’m a 53-year-old woman and I melted right then and there.
happy,"Has a sad start, but trust me it’s really nice once you read it all.


Long story short many years ago I had a lot of falling out with people I cared about. All my fault. Since then I thought of myself as a horrible person due to the guilt and shame. Lead me down a dark road. Even tried to kill myself in 2022 due to it all since it was getting harder and harder to handle. 

Last night I decided to reach out on social media to one of them who I had falling out with in 2019. He accepted the apology. He even said everything was alright. How he moved on for everything, and then we wished each other well.

This came to a shock to me. Honestly I thought he was gonna get angry at me, but no. Was very sweet really. 

The next morning I decided to reach out to anyone else I could to apologize, to forgive them, or just to send thanks. Really was a great feeling to do. Gave myself closure and even them if they needed it. Plus, I think it was good for me to thank the people in my life who treated me well too. 

Some haven’t responded or even said much, but that doesn’t matter. My actions I took made me forgive myself regardless. 

I feel so much peace. Serenity and contempt all over my body. Almost as if a giant weight was lifted from my body and now the wound is stitched and healed. 

Can’t remember the last time I felt like this. It’s a beautiful feeling and I hope get to experience it too. "
happy,"Hey all, today I woke up and stepped on a weight scale and saw it was 158.5lbs :) I was around 202lbs when I started and it's amazing I reached into the 150 range, the last recorded weight of me I can remember was being around 160 a couple years back and it has only gone up since then. The fact I'm lower than that makes me extremely proud of myself and that change really is possible! 

It really helps I also have my boyfriend supporting me and he's one of my main motivators, he helps me feel secure and safe :D

There were times I ""failed"" and felt terrible about myself that I didn't keep myself in check, then I always tell myself, ""it's a marathon, not a race"" and that along the way you will have difficulties snacking, plateaus, and others where you just go beyond your calories for the day. But also, times where you'll do it and be succcessful. In the end they all add up and you will see that no matter what, that you DID lose weight because you didn't give up regardless of all the missteps. The smallest steps are my favorite, esp at the beginning! Because something is working. The scale isn't always accurate and fluctuates, so I take pictures and the differenc is very noticable :)

Super proud of myself, and thankful to my boyfriend in this journey."
happy,"So, basically I had 1€ in my bank account, a d my best friend transfered the remaining 5 to me, because we wanted to play a game together that was on sale. I'm so grateful and happy. I'm definitely going to pay him back though, because I would feel bad if I didn't. Besides, it's the right thing to do. He just deserves the world. Of course, I told him that he didn't have to since it's just a game i could get dor the regular price next month, but he insisted so much, because he knew how much I liked the game from watching him play it during shareplay.

As someone has asked this before in this thread : I'm not comfortable sharing private information with strangers such as sharing my PayPal info."
happy,"What's so special about an office snack drawer?

It sounds funny but I have dreamed of having my own snack drawer at my own desk in my own office for as long as I can remember.  While I may not have my own office, I have a nice cubicle next to a large set of windows in the corner of the building.  It's wonderful!

I spent the better part of a decade getting an undergraduate engineering degree and graduated at 33 while working to support myself and doing extracurricular projects.  There were so many times I just wanted to quit.  I moved around a lot and changed majors at one point so it took a while to get through it all but I did it.  I now work for a company that I've always wanted to work for and I have myself a snack drawer.

It's silly but this snack drawer reminds me of all the blood, sweat, and tears that went into getting my degree and I just feel so accomplished when I turn around, open it, and grab some crackers.  I've come so far since I was waiting tables with no direction in life and it's a nice reminder that all the hard work paid off.  I can't help but smile when I think about it.  Lmao, sounds so weird typing it out but it makes me so happy!"
happy,I've been exercising and training everyday. I reach one goal and improved on another. Every morning I do fourty sit ups. Now I get the fourty in but I have to usually do them I sets of ten or take a break. Today I did a complete set of fourty with no breaks all one set so I'm very happy about that. Also yesterday in my running I went further than usual and was less winded. I run in intervals so I was less winded in intervals. So I'm very happy about those things.
happy,"I’m in community college, and I found that for this semester (spring semester) I’d gotten a bad English professor. I received a 25/50 on an assignment due to not formatting it correctly - on ratemyprofessor, many students were complaining about his oddly specific formatting rules (this man expected us to read five pages to adhere to his formatting guidelines… no thanks!) I’d actually started the assignment I received a 25/50 on early and had trouble submitting it in the docx form he really wanted us to submit it in, had to stop my Child Development Zoom meeting to call my college’s tech support at nighttime just to find a way to submit this assignment. This professor said he “wasn’t sure” and that I “still had time to call” when I asked him if I’d receive a 0 if I was unable to get the document submitted by the deadline even though I mentioned I’d started it early and that it was done. 

After much crying yesterday when seeing I had a 25/50 (this lowered my grade to a D+… I’ve never had a D+ in an English class) I simply decided, even though it means I’ll only be taking three courses this semester, to just drop the class. I have a job, I don’t know what I see myself doing in the future, and I felt like I just don’t have time for this, so I chose to drop the class. No extra stress needed. And I have no regrets about dropping it."
happy,"I didn’t think I made enough money but I submitted my documents and they said I make way more than the qualifying amount. This is my first big adult real-life payment, and I’m so excited to move in. It’s an awesome place. "

They seem to be House finch eggs as some of you correctly predicted!!! Happy late easter everyone and have an awesome week!!!"
happy,"So happy right now. 

I made some new friends through work. The three of us clicked immediately on the first day. 

Tonight, we went to dinner at my favorite restaurant (Korean BBQ). We ate so much great food and drank so much delicious soju lol

I dont remember the last time I laughed so hard. My cheeks were flushed and I smiled the entire drive home. 

Feeling so grateful for the good people in my life 🥰☺️"
happy,"Ever since my divorce my life has been soooo much better! I had no idea how much he was dragging me down financially, physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

I’ve paid off all my credit cards and have finally started saving — saving! I’m at my goal weight and I look and feel amazing. I have a gorgeous apartment that I get to decorate however I want; and since my tax return was huge then I actually have the money to do it!

For the first time in my life I only have ONE job, and it’s remote! 

The weather is glorious, my dog is the best ever, I have great friends, my plants are thriving, I love spending time with myself, and I’m even drinking less! 

Thanks for listening Internet strangers, it always feel like too much to brag to friends and family when you’re feeling this good! "

happy,"I know it's not a huge deal but after a lot of research and taking my time I successful did a full brake job on my vehicle. I've been driving it for a week now and it's been a smooth ride, great braking and just overall really happy that I was able to complete it. In a way it really built some significant confidence for myself. I usually just do my own oil changes so this was a big step forward."

happy,"Where I live, there’s practically nothing on this road, other than apartment complexes, a school, a few house (all neighbors in the houses get along really well-) and a little corner store ran by an older Asian woman.

I am the type of girl who wears that ‘emo aesthetic’ as my mom calls it, but really I wear skater/street wear and it drives her insane. Today I am meant to go to a meeting and dress nice, so I put on a cute little dress and a cardigan matched with black heels my sister let me borrow.

My mom asked me to go get some coffee from the store, and I accepted happily so I can see the Asian lady since I actually enjoy the small talk we have when I’m checking out. When walking there however, my heel had broken outside her store, and I went in any ways with a hop, and went to get the coffee, but she had stopped me.

She took a look at what happend, and the grabbed green string and told to kneel down, and I did. She started wrapping the heel in string, and fixed it temporarily. I thanked her Atleast 20 times before I had checked out and joked about it with her for a bit.

She really made my day so much better and I can’t thank her enough, even if the trying didn’t hold all the way there and back, it still was a nice feeling and made me really happy."
happy,"My birthday was the 27th and I received money for letting me buy supplies to try sculpting for the first time. I went to Micheal’s and got everything I needed! The wonderful cashier gave me a discount and I was able to add a few more things I’d been eyeing! 

I drew ideas for figurines ages ago and I finally get to turn one of them into a reality!! This is my progress so far! I’ve never sculpted clay before but I have done some models on ZBrush and watched a few tutorials on working the clay, so I had an idea of how things were going to go. I’m doing piece by piece and then putting them all together at the end. I plan to paint and varnish it as well!! 

I’ve had a lot of fun so far and I’m really excited to finish it!!"

happy,Me and my wife have been together 20 years in October and married 16 in November. As long as I've known her she's been a smoker. I was a smoker myself. I finally kicked the habit three years ago. Bur my wife has been incredibly stubborn on the subject. Today we talked for a while and she decided to take steps to quit. I couldn't be happier with this decision. I'm aware that this will not he easy but she's at least willing. And I'm gonna stand by her and take all the crap that comes with quitting. If it means she can improve her health and I can have her longer I am more than willing to be her punching bag for a few weeks. I'm very proud because she really didn't want to do this. 
happy,"I was finishing some work, and I realized, while listening to a Gilmore Girls analysis video, that I have genuinely not felt suicidal in a couple of days!

I unfortunately have to go to school tomorrow morning, but for what its worth, I've not been entirely suicidal lately!"

happy,I have schizophrenia. I was never happy until I had kids. My kid did a play and I thought her role was so cool. They did game of thrones with Disney princess.

My uncle beat my aunt my other uncle beat his kids. My sister was raped. My dad held me and family hostage at gun point. I doing better. 
happy,"It feels so euphorically good to be in love with my best friend. Have I laughed? Constantly, daily, hourly. Have I cried? Yes, tears of joy. We play video games, sometimes I watch him play, sometimes he watches me, but when we play together we always have each others backs! We go on long walks, at night, with our dog, to the beach, to different cities or exploring shops and attractions. We leave each other love notes, poetry, words of encouragement. We workout and hold each other accountable, cook meals together. We love each other’s families and feel comfortable and accepted. We have spa days together, face masks, bubble bath, scrubs, moisturizer and massages. When either of us feels sad we listen with true understanding and openness, thoughtful advice and write out plans to strengthen our resolve. We dance together, in our home, in the grocery store, with our dog or anywhere we feel like. I’ve never been so in love, at peace, accepted,  empowered and confident. I am finally happy. "
happy,"It looks like no big thing, normal achievements for most people, but 2 years ago I was depressed, no job, no money, no friends, single, my mental health wasn't good at all. Now I'm working, I have a job, I met a girl that I really like, she became my girlfriend, and I started to work out, I've gained a few pounds, my physique looks better now.

I'm really proud of myself and feeling happy. I felt like sharing it because depressed people can change their life for the better, it's not easy but it's possible!"
happy,"I love him so very, very much."
happy,"Getting groceries with my(31) wife(29) and our 3 month old baby yesterday, I saw a kid standing in the middle of the aisle blocking someone trying to get their cart through. He turned and noticed them, stepped to the side and said ""oh excuse me!"". The parent around our age said ""good job (kids name) that was very polite!"". He said ""thanks, we have to think about other people too right?"", to which she replied ""that's exactly right"" and gave him a firm one arm hug.

Thinking about that this morning, it makes me so happy to see people teaching compassion and thoughtfulness nowadays. She seemed to be very involved as a parent, and I can't wait to be/teach that way for our daughter. Idk why but that thought is hitting that happy cord so hard today, just felt like sharing!"
happy,"This is so weird , but a few days ago my boyfriend and I went into a little no-contact stage after a small argument we had over something petty . 

It wasn’t specific or anything but we both just stopped reaching out and got busy . 


Well yesterday after like 2 days of no contact , I go to message him on instagram and the second my message delivered, I received a message from him on text message 😂 

We literally messaged each other at the exact same moment after 2 days and were thinking of each other exactly at the same moment 

So adorable haha "

My contract at work is ending before I go on maternity leave and I can't wait to have extra time to do all kinds of stuff for baby and the house in general. 

My husband is amazing and supportive in every way imaginable. 

My relationship with my parents have strengthened over the last couple of years and especially now that I'm pregnant. 

My friends write to me often even if we don't have as much time to see each other as we would like. 

I'm so happy I could burst with joy and gratitude. 

I wish everyone could feel this feeling but I'm scared if I talk too much about all the good things in my life it would come of as bragging?

Does anyone else have these thoughts?
How should I deal with it?

Thank you in advance and sorry for formatting I'm on my phone. "
happy,"Howdy! 

I'm so appreciative of all of y'all's support! I was worried if I was overstaying my welcome on this sub, but y'all were so supportive! For anyone starting their fitness journey from my posts, or anyone who is in their own fitness journey, I'm so proud of you! I'd like to address a couple thing so constantly see in the replies. I'd rather address it on the post instead of individual comments. 

I do infact know I need a calorie deficit to lost consistent weight, and I've been on a calorie deficit since day 2

No, this is not a karma farm. Anyone who values karma so much they lie and take advantage of peoples kindness is an idiot. If you still believe this is a karma farm, that's fine but please don't be rude to or others who just want to improve their lives.

Yes, I know I'm fat, I know I'm unhealthy, you don't need to constantly spam in in the replies. Please come up with more insults because I'm running out of jokes. 

Sorry for the long post but I hope y'all have a great day, Cheers!"

So for some context, I moved out to attend university over 6 months ago. It has been a tough but enjoyable experience so far and i have learnt many new things and made some new friends. Not a bad experience at all. However, i haven't seen my family and my cat (my pride and joy) since i left and i dearly miss them.

Today, my mom and i booked me a flight back home to visit for a whole month. I am so happy that i am full on happy sobbing. It doesn't seem like that much of a big deal, but it is to me and i am beyond excited!"
happy,"I really love him. I spent forever putting his gift together and when I finally gave it to him seeing him cry made me so happy. He said he’s never been loved like this before and that he loves me more than anything. 

I’m just so so happy I get to make him feel loved cause he makes me feel so safe and loved too. I’m not so great with my words like he is but I think this really showed him how I feel :)"
happy,"This is my life. I can't share this with anyone without coming off as boastful, but I just needed to put it into words. This is the story of my growth as a person through from being a kid to an adult through a year, from a single drunken realisation.

When I was a kid, I was, and still am, incredibly fortunate. I was born into a financially safe family with loving parents, a cool older brother. I was an athlete as a kid, smart, confident and socially liked. Kind, respectful, 'cool'. Mate's parents loved me, my friends thought I was the shit, everything was perfect. I got older, became a teenager. I had a big friend group, I was good with girls and good at the things I tried. I never tried in school and did well, and I started truly becoming a prick. I was so full of myself. I picked on anyone that was different to me to make my mates or girls laugh, I was crass and rude. I'd spend my life fucking around with my friends, not doing anything of value and arguing with people on the internet to get a rise out of them. I didn't appreciate my parents or my family, I'd show up late to important things and not bother going to things if I didn't absolutely have to. My mates started getting sick of me. My parents started getting sick of me. My brother started getting sick of me.

Then adulthood came. I was 18, I finished school with decent marks, got into a good degree at uni, and started completely letting everything go. For my entire life, everything had been done for me. I'd show up, do the bare minimum, and life started going downhill because of it. I got into a relationship with a girl and interjected myself in her life. I'd try and 'fix' things for her that didn't need fixing, and her resentment grew. She came from a rough house, wasn't mentally healthy and started taking it out on me, verbally and emotionally. My life caught up with me. I was turning in my assignments at the last possible moment, scrapping together the lowest amount of money possible to pay for alcohol, club tickets and petrol, I was putting up with emotional manipulation and hurtful insults from the girl I loved. I stopped going to the gym. I started smoking. I let myself go mentally and physically completely. I gained heaps of weight, picked up terrible habits with everything you can think of. I embraced the full on 'loser' lifestyle. I leeched off my family and made nothing of myself. Me and my ex broke up in a bad way, and I put up with the harassment for months afterwards.

I was a 'yeah I'll get around to it' type of person. I was gonna get my shit together, I was gonna get back to the gym, I was gonna work on myself EVENTUALLY. I was gonna get a tattoo, I was gonna finish uni, I was gonna get a 'real' job. Every day I'd lie to my friends, my family, but most importantly, myself. I'd lie that I was going to get things back on track and start living, but it never happened. I never started anything. I had my hand in a thousand things and the moment I wasn't immediately gratified with a reward, I quit. I was gonna make more friends and go travelling! I was going to get a high paying job with absolutely zero effort! I was so stuck in the mindset of everything being easy and done for me, that I just expected things to work out for me.

At the start of last year, I was a fraction of the human I am now. To cope with how 'hard' life was, I did everything dumb you can think of. I was a 20 year old bloke, depressed, selfish, leeching loser. All I did was party, chat up girls, eat like shit, drink too many beers and smoke too much bud, and ALWAYS fuck off any real work and ambition for a good night with my mates. I had zero self-control, zero idea, zero moderation and idea of where I was going and what I was capable of. No life skills. For Christ's sake, I could barely do my own laundry. My Mum had taken care of almost every tiny aspect of my life and I'd never even appreciated her for it. I remember going to my ex's and barely knowing how to wash dishes because I was that useless in any real life skill. Everything was done for me.

Then things got rough. My dad's heart essentially gave out, my brother who had always been a stalwart, mature and driven bloke had a full blown mental health crisis due to some physical health issues, and my family collapsed. Dad was off work and Mum was taking care of him, my brother was bedridden and lower than any low I'd seen him overcome before. And there I was; sat in my room, taking my life for granted. I was playing games into the late hours, never doing my uni course work and working a casual, extremely low-hour and low paying job, not because I was busy, but because I was lazy and didn't want to face any real work. I'd rather just sit in my room and watch every youtube video and pump as many hours into games as I could, then the weekend would come and I'd be drunk/high for the entirety of it and make stupid self destructive choices. Never saved any money or did anything for anyone farther than what I had to do to consider myself a good person. I was seeing a girl I had no romantic interest in because I was bored, taking her kindness for granted. Absolute rock bottom. My mental illness was out the wazoo. Shit was absolutely brutal and was truly my lowest low.

Then, one day, I was over at a mate's and we were playing poker. I had a smoke in my mouth and 8 or 9 empty beer bottles next to my chair and a fresh one in my hand, hair greasy and out of sorts, basically had my pyjamas on, totally mashed. I looked over at a mate to make a stupid joke and caught a look at myself in the mirror. I was overweight, my skin was a mess, I was borderline unwashed and I absolutely HATED it. I realised in a fraction of a second that all the anger and hurt I was balling up in my stomach wasn't directed to anyone else. It wasn't the people who'd put me down, it wasn't my ex, it wasn't my loving family who I perceived as 'overbearing and annoying', it was me. I'd come from a life of such opportunity and I'd squandered all of it. My life was in shambles and it was MY fault. No one put a drink in my hand or a smoke in my mouth, no one put a gun to my head and stopped me studying and working on myself. I'd done it myself. I was a total dick to everyone around me, even catching the insult to my friend in my throat that wasn't funny in the slightest; just a knee jerk reaction to something he'd said. I was immature in every sense of the word, and I was completely wasting myself, my opportunities and my life.

In that moment, I was truly, truly disgusted with myself. I loathed the life I'd wasted, and then came to another instant realisation. That didn't have to continue. I didn't have to hate myself anymore. I'm young, there was still time to put things in the right place and get it done. I didn't have to keep up with my ex's instagram anymore, I didn't have to drink myself to death to have a good time. I didn't have to spend all of my free time outside of partying playing games and being bored. There was new things to try; a whole life yet lived.

Over the next month, I made changes. I put my study on hold, which was an incredibly hard thing to do. For the first time truly in my selfish life, I sacrificed my own movement forward to take care of the people around me. I got out there, picked up another job. I started trying. I started, very slowly, turning myself back into someone I once was, someone a young me could be proud of. Someone my parents could be proud of. Someone I could be proud of. I stopped drinking for an entire month, which I hadn't done since I'd turned 18. I completely put down the bong. I booked myself into a therapist and paid for it myself, not trying to wrangle money out of my parents to put money into self growth that would go to waste. I wrote down a list of my goals. I signed back up to the gym. I stopped chasing late nights and cheap relationships.

I slipped up at times. Made dumb decisions, I hurt people. But I stopped beating myself up for my own mistakes and trying to blame circumstance or other people. I started holding myself accountable. I started showing regret and appreciation a lot more, I stopped saying 'I'll get around to it'. I started doing.

I started taking care of my dad physically, my brother mentally and giving my Mum a break. I'd clean the house and do the shopping so she could come home from work and just be with my old man. I went outside and learned to properly mow, learned how to hedge, how to weed and lay gravel. I fixed stuff in our house by myself with no direction except for google, I learned how to be financially intelligent, I learned true independence from my family for the first time. I learned that I could laugh louder and bring smile to peoples faces, I learned that within me was the ability to do anything I could put my mind to. I learned that part of my happiness came from spreading joy to those around me and making people smile. I learned to put down the lying, scummy, self loathing part of myself again. The pessimist. I started appreciating the sun more, I started spending more time just helping! I started spending real time with my brother. We became mates again. I started coaching him through his breakdowns and holding him through his panic attacks. I started kissing my mum on the cheek again and bringing my parents a coffee in bed. I started laughing with my friends instead of at them. I started showing pride in my own actions, pride in other's actions. I complimented people's clothes and their laughs, shaking more hands, working harder. I started catching up on all the uni work I'd missed and getting up earlier. I started going for runs. I starting putting greenery on my plate. I started washing up the dishes more, watching movies with my dad when he was awake, or sitting with him while he was reading. I started hanging out with my Mum and treating her to coffee and lunch, getting her out of the house. I started driving my friends around while they drank and I just smiled and laughed and got on the AUX for them. I started writing music and stories again. I put more effort into DnD characters, I stopped being embarrassed about stupid things. I started SMILING. Really, actually, SMILING.

I was going out, and I was partying, but I was drinking within my wallet and I wasn't so miserable when I was mashed. I started dancing and walking girl's to their front doors instead of just dropping them off. I started connecting with the kids at work and I started babysitting my cousins. I went over to my grandparent's house and fixed their technology, spending time with them. I stopped trying to what I considered cool and just starting doing fun shit. I tried bouldering. I tried surfing. I tried playing club footy again. I started hanging out with new people, people completely different to me. I started learning. I started to feel passion for things again. I started training muay thai because I'd always said I would.

I started DOING.

Now, here I am, emotional late at night and just so fucking HAPPY. I'm single and so content with my life and so busy that I have no interest in being in a relationship, I am overwhelmed with pure joy and so truly happy with who I am. I've lost weight. I don't smoke or vape anymore. I'm excited to wake up and go to work and come home and give my mum a hug and hang out with her while she cooks dinner. My dad's back to almost full strength and he's his old happy self, my brother is medicated and learning to become himself again. I spend less time in my room. I spend less time existing and more time living. Me and my friends are even actually going travelling next year, because I'll be graduating! We're doing a roadtrip across America and I'm so excited. I'm going to have so much fun and meet so many new people. Then I'm gonna come home, continue the life I'll be putting on hold temporarily. I'm gonna get a decent job and do my best. 

There will be pitfalls, I'm going to have bad days and meet bad people, have bad experiences but I'm stronger now than I ever was before. I can cook for myself. I can clean for myself. I help out around the house. I show my love to people. I write my feelings down and create stories that I share with my friends. I found my passion for being alive again. I've become a rock for someone very close to me that I work with every day to get her life back on track.

Don't get me wrong, I haven't fixed everything in a year. I still struggle with staying ontop of my newfound responsibilities and sometimes I'm lazy and sometimes I make dumb decisions, but I am leaps and bounds ahead of where I was. I am always trying to improve, and I can only go up from here.

One day, I'm going to be even happier than I am now. I'm gonna have a wife and kids that I can support through anything they go through, and I'm going to be a fuckin' great dad and dude in general. God fucking damn. I am absolutely ecstatic to be alive.

Life's good in the sunshine.

I had someone end up DMing me about this post talking about their own alcohol and nicotine intake and I just wanted to throw this on the end; there's nothing wrong with partying and having fun. I still go out and get pissed and what not, but the way I was doing it at the start of last year was simply as a coping mechanism. I was completely out of moderation and completely out of my head, and I was way overdoing it. There's nothing lame about getting drunk and having a good time, as long as you're doing so healthily and being safe! Everything in moderation."
happy,"I forgot I had this account. I finally got it back so I'm very happy :D it took a lot of password guesses and stuff, I also had to figure out my old email 😅 that was a bit of a chore. However, it worked out in the end :)"
happy,I live in Florida so pretty soon it’ll be too hot to spend entire days out here so we enjoy it when we can!!
happy,I work retail. I don't remember the last time I was called kind.
happy,I am in 9th grade and I was just going through so kinda rough times my ex was spreading rumors and her friend (a boy) wanted to jump me with a group of friends and it finally stopped. I had a track meet today and I couldn't run in the meet because I got injured in gym class (sprained knee). So I was taking times for all the running events and this one girl (senior) did a really good job on hurdles. When I got in the car the first thing I did was add her on snap to give her congrats on doing so well and it turned into us getting to know each other and then I asked her if being an adult is hard and she told me it wasent and reassured me it's actually fun because you can drive and get more jobs. We ended up talking about our plans for out of high school. This girl helped my fears of adulthood and actually made me exited for it.
happy,12 years ago we met in a psych ward after we had both tried to rage quit the planet. We've been together ever since!
happy,"We found out she had uterine cancer last week, and they scheduled her for a hysterectomy immediately. She had surgery this morning, and it went great. Minimum blood loss, no sign of cancer. I'm so relieved I can't even tell you. Best day of my life."
happy,"I had a good day today and wanted to share, hopefully someone out there can relate.

I am recovering from Postpartum mood disorder, it manifested as anxiety, and I had 'baby brain' which I didn't understand until I started to regain the ability to make decisions and perform tasks without feeling overwhelmed.

Today I remembered to do the things I set myself as tasks just as I was falling asleep last night. I have difficulty falling asleep, I often lay awake for 2 hours, just random thoughts, and often remember things I've forgotten to do and make myself mental to do list which I then regularly forget. Such as put pen and paper on bedside table to write down the to do list. (No phone near bed) Anyways, last night I remembered that I had forgotten to reply to an email I received a week ago, and today I replied, first little win. I also remembered I had to email stationery shop to get them to print a document for me, and I also remembered to go to the stationery shop to collect the print out. Double little win.

The biggest little win for me today was answering phone call that I felt was going to be awkward conversation, phone rang, I looked at display, realised it was awkward conversation, felt dread, thought about ignoring it and letting it ring out, but I answered, had the awkward conversation, and then it was done, finished, no more dread. Little win.

It doesn't sound like much I know, but to me it's a day of wins.

4 years ago I had a shopping bag full of unopened letters, that I was hiding because I didn't know what to do with them. Nothing scary in them, usual household bills, statements, renewal information, nothing that today I couldn't handle. But 4 years ago, it felt impossible. Postman would bring letters, I took them out of post box, and then stuffed them in shopping bag I hid in garage. Why? I don't know exactly. If I opened a letter I would then have to 'deal with it', whatever it was, and in my Postpartum mood I couldn't. The thought of opening envelope, then reading contents, then making decision to file document, go to home office room, go to bookcase, find appropriate folder, find hole punch, place document in folder, well, that was just impossible to accomplish. And that was for simple notification letter. What if it was a letter I had to do something with? Car insurance renewal? No way. Couldn't handle that. Ringing around to get quotes, comparing policies, nope, couldn't do it. Just hide the letters.

Today I can open letters. It's taken a long time to get here, I did it and I'm celebrating the little wins. If you understand, wonderful."
happy,"Stop living in your head and start living your truth. No one is worthy of judging you. We live on earth for such a short time. You want to spend it sad, stressed, and with anxiety? Fuck that!"
happy,"I'm so happy seeing her cuddled up in her old bunk bed this morning, we did something right huh? She still wants to be around us lol. "
happy,"Hello and Happy New Year folks! My first post here, hope everyone is doing well and it's time to start being happy 😊"
happy,"This is gonna start off sad, but I swear it gets better. 

August 2021 I graduated college. October 2021 I was given a job offer for a career I was incredibly excited about. The job offer payed decently, and was a stepping stone for my ex-gf and I at the time to be able to start moving our relationship into a more adult-relationship; ie, moving out, buying a house, etc. 

January 2022 I started at my job and loved it. March 2022 came around, and my ex at the time had blind-sided me and left without a word. I was devastated at the time. Fast forward a few months to October, I’m at the gym and I feel a tendon in the back of my leg snap. I can’t walk. I eventually go to the doctor who just diagnoses me with a strain and tells me to go to PT. 

Long story short, I visited 2 different doctors. Both of whom could not give me a proper diagnosis which caused the PT I received to only make things worse. I was on disability from my job to take care of my leg which just wouldn’t get better, as well as therapy for depression. Eventually, I was forced to leave my job, lost my health insurance, and didn’t know if I’d ever be able to walk again. I was alone, depressed, disabled, unemployed, and had no idea about the future and what was going to happen to me. 

Eventually, I found a physio who I was able to see via Zoom (about $20/visit, so I could afford it without insurance) who was able to diagnose me and we started a PT program that I was able to do by myself. It took a long time, but she got me back on my feet, back in the gym, back to running and everything. It took me about a year to walk again. It was an extremely long process. 

Near the end of my PT, I met this woman. Smart, funny, gorgeous, kind, driven and hard working, incredibly emotionally intelligent, and… well I could go on for hours talking about this woman. We hit it off, and started dating. She’s introduced me to so many new hobbies, many of which are active activities. Some team sports, and some individual sports. I’ve started some new sports of my own, and have began to introduce her to them as well. Not only has meeting her changed my life romantically, but I’ve also gotten very close to all of her friends of which she has many. When my leg didn’t work and I lost my job, I was alone almost 24/7. I had very little help with anything from family and friends. It was the darkest time of my life. Now, I feel like it’s one of the most social and happiest times of my life. It’s been a complete 180 from where I was before. 

When my leg got better, I also applied for a federal job. I’d always wanted to work for the federal government, not just for the benefits but also for the job security. It was a very long and stressful process, but just last week I received the email with a firm job offer and I am due to begin working with them next week. 

My life has completely changed. I was in the darkest time of my life, not knowing what was going to happen to me and not knowing if I’d ever be able to walk again, hold a job, etc. I’ve now picked up a handful of new hobbies, I’m exercising and running frequently, I have a new career which I’m beyond ecstatic to begin, and a wonderful girlfriend of which I can see an actual future with. 

Words cannot begin to describe how absolutely ecstatic I am for what my future holds. "
happy,"some of them don’t even know about that and to some of them we can don’t text for some time

it’s not bcu we ghost them, we forget ppl’s names and it’s hard to text some of them bcu we just forget names, we basically need to write it EVERYWHERE

happy,"I got a new co-worker 6 month ago and I was her mentor and organized her onboarding. Today she said to me, that she hopes I will get promoted zo be the boss of our little Team (4 people) at the end of the year since she believe I would be great as a leader."
happy,"These past few days, my boyfriend and I have been spending a lot of time on calls, sharing what our everyday lives look like. Since then, I have learned a lot about him: he hates when people eat messy stuff in his car, he likes a slightly messy room but not too much, and he really thinks it's important to have a cup holder when you're drinking in bed. But most importantly, when he sleeps, he snores a little bit. It's the cutest thing I've ever heard in my whole life. Maybe I'm just so in love, but hearing him sleep like that, with his little sounds, makes my heart so fuzzy. I love every little thing about him, every little quirk."
happy,"Just wanted to share this small victory, since im feeling hella good abt it.  
I tried to filter a dataframe for certain items, but it always gave me the code ""undefined columns selected"". I couldn´t solve it for literal DAYS and it really frustrated me to the point of crying.

  
Turns out i just forgot that the items had a headline in the program! So no wonder i defined them wrongly! I forgot that i didn´t turn off the headline while importing the dataset, and that´s why it always gave me that error!

  
I know i´m not a genius, but i feel absolutely undefeatable right now.

Thanks for reading my small vent :)"
happy,"I spent all of February in rehab for alcohol. I spent 6 months in a homeless shelter, got my CDL, picked out a company of my choosing, bout to be an uncle 3 times over, and recently celebrated 7 months sober! This is the first time in 6 years I’ve been truly happy. If you’re having a hard time feel free to contact me, I’d love to chat!"
happy,"Basically what the title says. I don't really have anyone else to share this with, but I feel quite accomplished. My story is basically growing up poor, a bunch of federal and private loans to get a degree (out of state, had to escape the crabs in that barrel), loan to get a decent vehicle, and then I got a job as far away as I could manage. Now, just shy of my 27th birthday, all of my loans are paid off right as my employer is paying to send me back to get a master's degree in my field (I start next term). It feels like I'm free, truly free, for the first time in my life. "
happy,"I've been sad for nearly 2 years after my best friend completely moved on from me after 13 years. I'm not longer angry or sad about it. 

I can't change it. She's happy now, and that's all I wish for her. I'm at peace with the whole situation at last. I'm happy knowing she's happy, and that we can still be friends, even if we're not as close. 

I think of our memories fondly, and not in sadness. And I feel so much more free, it's always been in the back of my mind since it happened, and when I first thought of her today I just felt alright. Life will do what it will. I absolutely can't wait to make new friends"
happy,I was in a bowling league for 4 years up until 2020 and they had to end the league due to covid. I got super unmotivated about everything and I didn't rejoin when it opened. For Christmas I asked for a new bowling ball because I want to play in a league again. I got my ball but leagues aren't available yet so I've been practicing on my own. I'm already better than I used to be and more consistent. My previous record was a 217 from 2019. Last night I bowled a 213 and then a 224. I'm gonna light up the league 😊
happy,"Throughout my life I have dealt with a series of health problems and that caused me to be very lethargic. Been to hospital and so on many times. Mainly stuff with my ovaries, kidneys, and liver.  

One thing that made me upset a bit was when I was 17 and attempted to donate blood, but was just not able to due to my condition and problems in general.

Today after dealing with going to the doctors pretty much once a month last year I was finally eligible to donate and so I signed up and did so. 

Happened only a few hours ago and I feel great! Before when I used to get blood drawn for example for medical reasons I would get very nauseous and faint just due to how my health was. Feels strange not feeling that way despite the donation being more blood."
happy,"My son loves to play outside. The house next to us is being rebuilt so it is unoccupied at the moment. There is a small pond located on the property so every now and then we venture over there to see what sort of wildlife we can spot. Yesterday, disappointment struck when we arrived to the pond and didn’t spot any animals. Normally there’s at least a few ducks, but not today. After about 10 minutes he looked down at the ground, picked up a very high-quality stick, and threw it into the water. The stick struck the water. The splash made him so happy he exclaimed, “I did it dada, I did it.” It took me a second but then I realized, wow he is so happy because of the stick hitting the water! Mind you, I have never thrown anything into this pond before, so this was just his primal instinct telling him “pick up stick, throw stick water, stick make splash, make boy happy”… anyways I thought I’d share this because it was enough to make a grown-man cry. Such simple acts can bring so much joy. We’re such simple creatures haha. Have a great day everyone

"
happy,"I was scrolling through Reddit and came across a video of this tiny dog carrying an abnormally large stick, maybe even a branch in his mouth, waddling around with it as he tried to balance himself, it was absolutely adorable! I love dogs, man <3"
happy,"I'm so happy seeing her cuddled up in her old bunk bed this morning, we did something right huh? She still wants to be around us lol. "
happy,"For 24 years I've worked to grow my business.  As a single parent it has been tough.  I missed many precious moments with my daughter and I've always regretted it.  My company has been my second greatest accomplishment next to my daughter.  I'm truly happy to sell it today because I'm selling it to the employees who have done so much to make it great.

I never thought this day would come and it's been an emotional rollercoaster for the last four years. I feared what retirement would mean.  I had an identity crisis coming to terms with not being the boss.  I feared boredom but the pandemic has taught me that I don't need my business.  Connection to my family and hobbies are more than enough to provide fulfillment.

I had a hard time with selling, I built this company and it's a reflection of me.  I've had plenty of offers from larger firms but I don't want to think what would have happened to my company, my employees and it's reputation if some huge conglomerate absorbed it.

It's taken years and I am not getting as much as I could if I sold to a competitor but I'm selling to people who I know will continue the company with the same standards I built it with.  I'm selling to the employees who are the ones that made it all possible. I also know I'm the only one who will be out of a job from this.

It took 4 years to let go and today I finally signed. In a few more months I'll walk away, happily. I have many years left to spend with my family, travel, enjoy my farm, and my horses. I'm truly thankful for the last 24 years and everyone who has made this moment possible.

happy,"Tomorrow is my 18th birthday. I don't have friends, I don't have a high school diploma, I'm fighting/no contact with almost my entire family, and I work a low paying job. But I'm alive, I have a roof, usually have food. There are a lot of people that can't say the same. I've been severely depressed since I was young, a lot of people told me to ""die"", or that ""I definitely wouldn't make it to adulthood"" (guess what, bitches). Eighteen years old is like a baby that can vote, I have a lot to figure out. I'm just beginning life. 

I'll treat myself tomorrow, I'll order in a LOT of food, and binge watch my favorite movie saga. I'm so proud of myself!!! 😎"
happy,"today i got in a car accident. i wasn't doing well lately and that car accident and the headache made me go in deep episode of depression. 

later i found myself in a ai image generator. i asked it to make one of my happiest days in the not so happy life of mine. and you know what? it didn't disappoint me.

this is a date i had with my love of life. it was beautiful day. i wore red polo shirt that she gave me in my birthday (she is one of 2 people who cares about my birthday) and she wore this outfit (pink skirt, white shir, pink hijab) that she wore in the day that i started loving her. before that we used to be friends, and we spoke a lot. i used to think of her as the coolest girl out there. and she thought of me like this as well (yes i said cool, yes we were young and yes i still do think of her as the coolest girl out ther). one day we decide to meet, i went to to that location, when i saw her from a distance and she smiled at me from far, wearing this outfit it i fall in love, 

we met to give her her birthday present (black hijab from the type she loves so much but she didn't have a black one, and inside of it i put a kindder surprise as a extra surprise for later).

so later in the relationship after i confessed and growing together loving each other more and more, we met in one of our walk dates (dates is kinnda illegal here) i wore this shirt that she gave me and a bracelet that she made for me before my confession (really sweet gift), and she wore my favorite outfit she had (she knows how to make me happy).

in this date we hold hands for the first time ever. we have been loving each other for over a year and half by now. (i know it may be something alien to most of you but we live in different place with different rules.)

so this is a small part of our story. it made me happy to remember these days even with all of my cournt problems.


thank you for reading. i hope you have a happy day as well <3"
happy,"Haven't been to a gaming tournament in weeks, because depression hit me hard, to the point I couldn't eat anything sometimes for a couple of days. Pos grad depression hit me hard.

Finally decided I was tired of being a loser, so went to a local gaming tournament and it was amazing.

I talked to some old faces I recognized and even bonded with them even more then usual. I met some new people and I even got some complements on how good I was playing my certain character.

Overall it was so nice to interact with other people even though I was still nervous and self concerned about my appearance and everything, but this experience has convinced me to be more social. I even got invited to play in someone's dorm if I ever wanted to.

I stopped going cause people told me it was lame, and it made me even more depressed and self conscious about it. But I'm glad I'm gonna participate in more."
happy,"I start my first job tomorrow!

I’m a new grad nurse currently in the Philippines, and after passing the board exam, I contacted my review center and expressed my interest in lecturing to help teach others how to pass their licensure exam.

I’m starting tomorrow and it feels like a dream came true that I didn’t even know I had. I love helping people, it’s part of why I got into nursing in the first place, and the knowledge that I can have even a small part in helping others getting to that point makes me truly happy.

The company is very easy to communicate with, I respect the hell out of my seniors, I’ll travel around the country to lecture at the other centers, and I’ll be able to use this opportunity to also help prepare myself for eventually taking the US NCLEX as well.

This year hasn’t started out great, but this is a giant W to get my mood up, and I am so greatful for the opportunity and experience."
happy,"An undergraduate student I have mentored for the past two-ish years applied to graduate school for the Fall 2024 admissions cycle. I helped them a lot with their applications and talked through deciding where to apply, etc. I've been getting periodic texts from them over the last few weeks as they've received their admissions (and one rejection so far) and it's been such an honor to share in their excitement. They even said I'm one of the first people they want to tell and that just put me over the moon.

Today they got an acceptance into a BIG school and one that was sort of a ""shoot for the stars"" application and I just shrieked and hollered when I got their message. Tears are streaming down my cheeks, but they are happy happy tears. What a privilege to be able to experience this joy with them. Truly an honor. I'm so lucky."
happy,i look good and i feel good - hiking five miles every morning has been glorious and the views here are chefs kiss! just wanted to share that little slice of sunshine. :)
happy,Was starting to feel worthless. I could cry I’m so stoked.
happy,"My mom, who is literally one of the most thoughtful and kindest people I've ever and probably will ever meet, owns a storage place where she keeps all of her things that she sells. Sometimes, if she knows the person and knows they're struggling, she will give them things for super cheap. Like one time she sold someone she knew was struggling two nice brand new thick comforters for 4 dollars. She's very well known in the area for this and sometimes people will come and knock on her door just to give her stuff that they don't want, just because they know she'll take it and do good with it.

I always had a little pink mini frigidaire that I kept some of my beauty products in and I loved it dearly, but a few months back it stopped working. I never made a big deal out of it but my mom knew of it. Well, she kept it in mind apparently when today she came to me and gave me a practically brand new, perfectly working, mini black frigidaire that one of her friends didn't want anymore. Just because.

My mom is always reminding me that I can have anything that I want in her storage, she even insists on it when I tell her that I want to pay her. She will shout at me and say ""No! Take it! I don't want your money!"" I'm really grateful to her because I'm surrounded by really beautiful things (both vintage and non vintage) because she lets me have anything I want. I'll just look at something for two seconds too long and she'll ask ""You like it? You want it??"" It's funny really.

When she gave me the frigidaire I told her just how grateful I was and that I felt really lucky to have a mom like her. She said to me that I reminded her of herself at my age and that she once said the same words to her mom, who also owned a storage full of stuff that she would sell. Her mom (my grandma) was the same way and gave her whatever she wanted for free. It's no wonder I was surrounded by very pretty, sometimes downright luxurious looking things growing up too!

I know it's a bit superficial, it's not the only reason I am grateful to my mom, but it's just how thoughtful it was. It made me really happy. I'm glad to have a teensy fridge again too."

happy,"I started a music project with two of my best friends a couple of years ago.  After releasing our first album I reached out to an author / reviewer to get feedback on what we'd put together.  I didn't get any feedback the first time around: this person was super busy so I didn't take any offence.  After releasing our second album I reached out again, still hopeful we'd get a listen.  It turns out this person liked our work quite a bit!  We got some very kind compliments.  I'm still smiling a day later. "
happy,"I learned a new word the other day and am practicing it now.

Hurkle-durkle originates from the Scottish language which means to lounge in bed longer than when you should have gotten up.

I think I can be an Olympic class or professional hurkle-durkler.  I've been practicing so long without knowing it that I'm actually a professional my first time trying!!!!   

May everyone have at least one hurkle-durkle day a week."
happy,"2 years ago, when I told my family and friends I wanted to release all original music as a fully independent artist, and try to turn it into a full time living, almost everyone I knew didn’t believe I’d get very far… I know realistically the vast majority of people that try don’t get far, so I could understand where they were coming from (the music industry is insanely hard to make a living in). But I would never know if I didn’t try…So I did. And I worked so hard, and so many times I asked myself why I was doing this…So many times I wanted to give up. But looking at this milestone, I feel very happy and proud that I didn’t give up. I’m also earning a decent part time income from my music too! The next goal is full time! Just thought I’d share this, and to not give up on your dreams if you truly love doing them! :)

happy,"I just got the best news!!!

After months of waiting, many tests, background checks and a fun 4 hour long psych eval with even more tests involved…

I got offered a job as a County Detention Deputy!!!!

It’s almost double the yearly salary I have been getting for the last few years!

This is fantastic news!!!!"
happy,"My mom, who is literally one of the most thoughtful and kindest people I've ever and probably will ever meet, owns a storage place where she keeps all of her things that she sells. Sometimes, if she knows the person and knows they're struggling, she will give them things for super cheap. Like one time she sold someone she knew was struggling two nice brand new thick comforters for 4 dollars. She's very well known in the area for this and sometimes people will come and knock on her door just to give her stuff that they don't want, just because they know she'll take it and do good with it.

I always had a little pink mini frigidaire that I kept some of my beauty products in and I loved it dearly, but a few months back it stopped working. I never made a big deal out of it but my mom knew of it. Well, she kept it in mind apparently when today she came to me and gave me a practically brand new, perfectly working, mini black frigidaire that one of her friends didn't want anymore. Just because.

My mom is always reminding me that I can have anything that I want in her storage, she even insists on it when I tell her that I want to pay her. She will shout at me and say ""No! Take it! I don't want your money!"" I'm really grateful to her because I'm surrounded by really beautiful things (both vintage and non vintage) because she lets me have anything I want. I'll just look at something for two seconds too long and she'll ask ""You like it? You want it??"" It's funny really.

When she gave me the frigidaire I told her just how grateful I was and that I felt really lucky to have a mom like her. She said to me that I reminded her of herself at my age and that she once said the same words to her mom, who also owned a storage full of stuff that she would sell. Her mom (my grandma) was the same way and gave her whatever she wanted for free. It's no wonder I was surrounded by very pretty, sometimes downright luxurious looking things growing up too!

I know it's a bit superficial, it's not the only reason I am grateful to my mom, but it's just how thoughtful it was. It made me really happy. I'm glad to have a teensy fridge again too."
happy,"Husband had to work in Kinross, but stayed in St Ignace. Someday we'll make it up to Mackinac in the Summer, but for now I can have the fudge! The kids each got chocolate, I have Turtle, Sea salt and caramel, and chocolate peanut butter."
happy,"I was stopping by to make another donation, and it just made me so happy to see! She looked so happy holding and petting that little plushie, and it felt really good knowing that it went to someone who would love and cherish it far more than I ever did."

happy,"My birthday was the 27th and I received money for letting me buy supplies to try sculpting for the first time. I went to Micheal’s and got everything I needed! The wonderful cashier gave me a discount and I was able to add a few more things I’d been eyeing! 

I drew ideas for figurines ages ago and I finally get to turn one of them into a reality!! This is my progress so far! I’ve never sculpted clay before but I have done some models on ZBrush and watched a few tutorials on working the clay, so I had an idea of how things were going to go. I’m doing piece by piece and then putting them all together at the end. I plan to paint and varnish it as well!! 

I’ve had a lot of fun so far and I’m really excited to finish it!!"

happy,"

My professor had embarrassed me in front of the whole class because I did not know one answer. He started asking me my name and throwing comments about how I don't know anything and all. He made me stand in front of everyone. Nevertheless, I, someone who's suffering from anxiety disorder and severe anxiety, someone who gets embarrassed so very easily, for the first time, did not get embarrassed. 

I was pretty chill tbh. I did not have a raised heartbeat, I did not feel extremely sad, I did not panic, I might have had a few tics but that's it. After he left, I just went about doing my job and honestly I was impressed with myself. Idk whether this happended because I have a bigger embarrassing situation/trauma to deal with such that this felt so small or because I was already tired of everyone's sh!t. 

It happened and I'm honestly kinda happy."
happy,"Over the next few days I urge you all to take a break from the news and simply reflect on the blessings in your life and opportunities that may present themselves in the future.

Forget the bad times of 2023, reflect on what you have in your life......your health, a loved one(s), friends or the rich culture around that you may have taken for granted.

See you all next year!  "
happy," 

On Feb 15th I was 214 pounds . Went on a low calorie diet and eating only once or twice a day of lean chicken and 3 veggies and only drinking water/water with no sugar flavoring. 40 minutes at 3mph daily on the treadmill and 20 minutes daily of benchpresses and curls . Today I'm at 198 !!!!!!! Still got a ways to go my goal is 180 but getting there!!!!

I'm excited."

happy,I'm just happy with the result. It's better than I thought. I was worried I may be diabetic due to some sudden aligning symptoms. I'm thankful I could test for this independently rather easily.
happy,"So happy right now. 

I made some new friends through work. The three of us clicked immediately on the first day. 

Tonight, we went to dinner at my favorite restaurant (Korean BBQ). We ate so much great food and drank so much delicious soju lol

I dont remember the last time I laughed so hard. My cheeks were flushed and I smiled the entire drive home. 

Feeling so grateful for the good people in my life 🥰☺️"
happy,"My bucket list is filled with things like running with the bulls, paragliding from the summit of Mt. Blanc and climbing Mach Piccu, many things I won’t likely get around to, leaving my bucket unsatisfyingly shallow. 
My anti-bucket list has simpler and more achievable goals like removing unhealthy eating habits, avoiding overcommitting myself and purging toxic people and negative influences.
This bucket is filling up much faster and I’m finding longer term happiness rather than short term excitement. "
happy,"Pretty rainy today but that ain't stopping me! Walked the same distance as yesterday but I'll try another mile in a week or so! I appreciate the support of making this a daily thing and i also appreciate all of you who have ""joined"" me in my walking! Love y'all and I'll see you tomorrow!"

I was told to try a bike I could ""fit on"", and to get something smaller like my boyfriend's CBR400RR. But I got what I WANTED, not what I felt I had to settle for. And now I've started riding it on the road, I can confidently say that I'm so incredibly happy and proud of myself for getting the bike I wanted 🥰"
happy,This picture makes my day because it just says B 00 bs in a funny place!
happy,"We’ve had some pretty intense rain, heat and humidity over the past few weeks where I live, and it resulted in my garden going absolutely nuts with weeds. There wasn’t much I could do because it was either raining or so hot I would get heat stroke if I tried. So the last three days i spent a couple of hours each (still in the 30s Celsius) pulling the weeds. The first photo was taken after I had already pulled two garbage bags of weeds from the edge of the concreted space."

She's already a good Accountant but that piece of paper is unfortunately what you need to show it. I knew she'd get there in the end and she has achieved success today. She is going to go so far in her career and I couldn't be happier. Well done you superstar!

🥳👏🎉"
happy,"I've resisted unhealthy snacks today!

I've resisted, even though I've been tempted to have some because I'm quite hungry. I'm so happy, because I've gained almost 20kg due to my pregnancy and I desperately want to lose it so that I can feel good about myself again. 

Also, I plan on exercising today, even though it's hard to make time for myself. I've been so incredibly depressed after giving birth and, despite my hunger now, I'm not going to give in to having a snack because then I'm never going to make progress. 

I'm tired of disappointing myself and avoiding looking in the mirror. Today, skipping snacks and exercising is a small step in the right direction. I'm taking things one day at a time, one small step at a time. Please wish me luck! :)"
happy,"Man oh MAN!!! First off, im absolutely fucking ZOOTED off a 5mg candy. 2nd today was so freakin FUN! Long story short, i have been sober but a 5 year streak of Alcoholism. I slowed down to only on special occasions starting on my birthday (July 31) of last year, only drank christmas, thanksgiving, and once a week before christmas because i had found out my dad needed heart bypass surgery, last try out drink was a shot in February of this year and i have not drank SHIT since. Anyways, today i took my brother to the dispensary. It was his first time and i said it was on me. I got home and i felt so good i just wanted to share. 

Ive always wanted to cross of my bucket list have a first experience with one of my siblings. I know thats a odd experience but the way my brother was excited to go with me was so filling. It was just the fact that we got to enjoy a shared interest. although i do not condone drug use if it is illegal in your state, like i said, sharing a similar interest together was great. He even said “Next time i get paid, it’s on me.” 

Today was great. I feel so whole again. My heart feels so light for the first time in years and im just so excited to enjoy more things in life after feeling so low for such a long time.

happy,"I had a girl I’ve been dating over for dinner and drinks last night to celebrate NYE.  Things started getting physical so I suggested going to the bedroom.  It was a hard no.

I was a little bit puzzled (we’ve had sex before).  She then informs me she has her period, appears visibly upset and apologizes.  I sort of start laughing; now she looks puzzled.

I tell her I’m chuckling at the apology; there is absolutely no reason to be sorry and I couldn’t be happier just giving her a kiss at midnight and waking up beside her tomorrow (she’s never spent the night).  I offer her a heating pad, pillows and to run out to grab some midol; whatever she needs to be comfortable, she need only let me know.

The result was a lovely young lady, stunned by the thoughtfulness and filled with appreciation.  Though I invited a ‘date’ over for dinner, we decided to become exclusive and I woke up beside my new ‘girlfriend’ the next morning.

What a great start to 2022.

Edit: inclusion of exclusivity."
happy,"This morning I was going to work and it was dark but I saw my bf pass me on the highway on our way to work, I instantly got butterflies. Then when I got to the Dunkin drive thru who do I see in front of me….. it’s him.

The gentleman in front of you already paid” it’s the little things. y’all I’m so in love 🥰 "
happy,"Workplace moment

I had a mentally bad morning after my birthday and was having a moment thinking about how certain people in my life would react if I wasn’t in this world (for context this doesn’t happen often and I am ok now).

When I came to work I turned the corner and my colleagues sang happy birthday and had a cake out for me. 

Fair to say my day went from 0-100 after that. It’s the little things that matters, even if you don’t ask if someone’s okay."
happy,"M20
I’ve been thinking recently rather deeply about how much I truly love my family,Friends,Cousins and I’m just so thankful to have them in my life! They have done so much for me and honestly it just makes me feel emotional in a good way! I decided today I’m gonna give my full focus on my family and friends also cousins and show them that they matter to others and me! I really do get all warm and fuzzy just thinking about it! I’ll help with dishes more! I’ll help with laundry more! I’ll even tuck them into bed if they want! I’ll give them massages anything as long as it’s not illegal or bad haha! "
happy,"A day ago I posted about how happy and excited I was that I made a plan to visit my boyfriend suddenly! And he was surprised a lot! But today he surprised me back by proposing me 😅🥺 So apparently he had plans to propose me before but the ring wasn’t delivered on time , so he was planning to propose me later this month. But since I visited him suddenly, he took this opportunity to surprise me back by taking out the ring at this magical hike we had today. This is probably the best thing ever happened to me, the uno reverse we all need in life ! 😭🤍✌️"
happy," just wanted to tell everyone,to start to appreciate the little things in life.The last two years I have been trying to find happiness and their have been ups and down,I lost some friends and I am even ashamed to say that I have been jealous of my friends having success because I didnt.Today I can say that I love my life,this is because I learnt to appreciate everything.In every single negative aspect in ur life there is something positive and and always remember that.You fight w friends or family,remember that u have friends or family and you are most likely fighting because u care for each other.You woke up in the morning ate  you ate food,thank god and if u dont believe just appreciate that u have food and a house to sleep in.Struggling with exams,you are doing exams u have an education and a future be happy,a negative always opens a door to a positive.Its normal to be jealous about something or someone you cannot stop these feeling but you are in your own path and your time will come and be happy for the person,good for them. Be happy and appreciate.When someone looks at you even on the street smile.They key to happiness is appreciating.Spread love and be nice😁"

happy,"2 years ago, my partner worked at Habitat for Humanity as a family coordinator, where she would help families apply, understand the criteria, and screen families for eligibility. There was a lovely immigrant family of 4, a mom, dad, teenage son, and younger daughter who were incredibly sweet and hardworking. The problem was that they applied 4 times, and each time, they either had just the smallest bit over income or they were not selected. My partner saw how hard working they were and how much this would turn their life around. They lived in a small 1 bedroom apartment and spending way too much on rent.  On the 5th application, my partner made sure that everything was correct, they were eligible, and she went to bat for them during committee selections, ensuring they got a house this time. They talked so often throughout the process and the mom called my partner her “daughter”, that is how close they became. Then one day, my partner gets home and tells me that this family got approved to get a new house after 2 years of rejections. I was floored with emotions as I had become so invested in their wellbeing. 

Now, my partner was the one that would be calling and letting the families know that they would be eligible to receive a home. I was so invested in this family that I made sure to listen to the phone call that she made to the mom of the family on speakerphone. As soon as she called, the mom thought something else was wrong and she didn’t get a home this round. Instead, my partner broke the news that they would be getting a house. That was when I immediately started balling my eyes out. I’m crying, my partner is crying, and the mom was crying.  It’s really hard to describe the amount of love the mom had for my partner and the gratitude she had for my partner doing everything she could to get them a home. I cried for a long time, even after they hung up. I’ve never felt so happy for someone else being so happy. To this day, when I think about that phone call, I tear up and could cry just like that day. I’ve never cried from happiness this way for anyone. As I write this, my eyes fill with tears thinking back to that beautiful moment. 

Later, the mom brought my partner a whole cake and other expressions of gratitude. It’s a moment that will stay with me for the rest of my life. Today, this family is thriving more than they ever have and we keep up with them. "
happy,"my online friend from a different country visited for her birthday and invited me to disneyland! i have never gone before in my life! i was really taken aback by her offer too. she bought my ticket, for her bday celebration trip? 😭😭😭

she made it possible that me and my partner could actually afford to go and meet her there. 🥺🥺🥺

i brought her a gift related to her one of her special interest, it was something she said she wanted too, so it was perfect and she was so happy. she also gifted me a plush, which is my special interest! i will cherish this plush forever. 

my partner and i spent the whole day with her and it was amazing. i have no irl friends, only online as it is what i prefer. i find like-minded individuals with the same interests! we are also both diagnosed with ASD, and we really clicked as friends in real life as we do online! ☺️ it was just the same! 

she is going back to her home country tomorrow and that’s bittersweet, but the memories we made today were priceless!

this is the first online friend i’ve ever met in person before too. she is such a sweet friend! my partner really enjoyed hanging out with her too! 

had to gush about my day, as it’s the best i’ve had in a very long time. maybe ever."
happy,I was able to buy the house mostly using money my mother left after she passed away.  And I think she'd be proud and happy knowing the hard work she put in while she was alive helped give me a new chance.  She always wanted me to live happy and now I am.

happy,They have had issues with past pregnancies and I know it weighed heavy on them. I'm just so happy this pregnancy worked out for them. Their daughter is so beautiful and I can't help but share it wherever I can
happy,"I'm solo traveling at the moment and I've had the realisation that I'm a completely different person than I was when I was younger (I'm 32 now). I remember back then I was so insecure and I dealt with crippling anxiety. I was so self aware and ashamed of myself that I had to mentally prepare myself to do grocery shopping because I was so afraid that people would judge me. I've never been conventionally attractive, but back then I was convinced I I was absolutely hideous and I didn't deserve good things. I feel so sorry for my younger self. Now I don't give a crap about what people think of me, I've accepted myself for who I am and find beauty in small things. Sometimes I still struggle with my appearance, but not in the self destructive way as I did ten years ago.I try to always be kind to myself and treat myself how I treat good friends. At the moment I'm doing whatever I want whenever I want, all the choices I make, I make for me. It is so freeing. I feel so much love for myself, ny life, my friends and family, my work.
God I love solo traveling."
happy,"I went septic 2 years ago due to a kidney stone that was obstructing my kidneys flows but after almost  3 YEARS (and it growing 2mm) its out due to me going to the ER and getting medicine because I knew something was wrong!

Listen to your body, and advocate as much as you need!"
happy,"She told me near the end of January of this year that she is gay. Since then she's been a lot more sociable and is flashing that gorgeous, radiant smile of hers a lot more often. She called me this morning (her mom has custody on weekends) and told me all about this girl and their date, and it's the happiest I've ever heard her sound.

I am so unbelievably proud of my little girl. I'm smiling ear to ear thinking about how happy she must be to be living as her true self. She is my world, and her happiness is my happiness."
happy,I've been using a Couch to 5k app that uses progressive overload to help you run a 5k. My mental health has been tanking so working out for MYSELF hits different. Potential weightloss a huge benefit. Anyways. Super proud of myself after being a potato for the last few years! 🥰😀
happy,It was a cheap one but decided to try real Champaign to celebrate 
happy,"My absolute angel of a mother in law and I are taking my future sister in law to a little tea house as surprise! We just told her to be ready to go at a certain time and have sworn all the boys to secrecy 😊. 

Mother in law, future sister in law and I really love tea so I really hope she likes it. Both of these ladies are absolute gems to be around and I cannot be more excited to have my future sister in law join the family ❤️. She is so sweet and considerate and sassy and I love her so much! And mother in law is an absolute doll. Anything and everything she can do to help, she'll do. She's a tiny spit fire of a woman and won't hesitate to show you what-for like she's 8 feet tall lol. 

My blood family has never treated me half as well as these ladies do and I am just so blessed to know them and have them in my life! 

So here's to a sneaky surprise!  *shush* no telling!🤫

Edit: She loved it and no one spilled the beans! We got to have a lovely little tea time with some wonderful conversation and some very delicious tea, yummy pastries and little finger sandwiches! She's actually thinking about using the location for her bridal shower 😊"
happy,"These are the things I've quit to be more happy:

Competetive gaming: Its just a bunch of pixels on my screen that has no real value and it also made me lose the fun for videogames over the years. 

Social media: I still use social media but less than before. It took me a long time of self discipline to do that and nowadays I have a screen time of 20 min at best. I also think that social media helped me with that as well because whenever I read comments all I read are either bot comments, brainrot opinions or unnecessary hateful stuff. This also made me realize if the time I put into watching internet content is worth it or not. I have the mindset of using the Internet only for research purposes for things I dont know about so I can learn new stuff.

Bad eating behavior: I used to heavily rely on vitamin pills because I would always refuse to eat certain things because a doctor on YouTube would tell me this is bad or that is bad etc. It really ruined me as a person but today I'm doing a bit better now. I feel more happy now that my body is receiving the natural vitamins which was craving for years.

Being home all the time: I always saw my home as a ""safe"" place where I always wanted to stay all the time. 

Its quite dangerous over time and it does get to you mentally. I wasnt afraid of going outside and I dont have social anxiety but I always felt comfy being home and not doing stuff outside. Nowadays I always try to go outside whenever I can unless Im out of energy. I even bought a professional camera JUST so I can have a reason to go outside and do some nice pictures of nature or other things that look nice.

Quitting all of these things made me more of a happy person and I appreciate life more. Im almost 22 and honestly... maybe I should've listened to my mom but my teenage self had other things in mind. 

Have a nice day everyone :D"

He is the strongest man I have ever met, I admire and look up to him more than he knows. We passed our one year recently and my love for him still grows day by day. The world seems so colorful with meaning falling out of every single fold and crevice. Everything has meaning. Every little bug exists at the same time as we do. As incoherent as it is, I even find joy in realizing we both have eyes to look at the same things together. We are under the same sky. Somehow these axioms of the human experience feel much more meaningful because he’s alive with me. If I had killed myself when I was 17 I would have never known he was out there in this very world that I am in. Living his little 17 year old life, experiencing things that would make him the man he is today. I sometimes wish we would have met as babies. I would’ve loved him when we were 10, 15, 20, just as much as I love him at 24. I think that’s what love is.
"
happy,"For context there's this one character that I absolutely adore from an old book series I love, we'll call him H. I've known H for just a year and he has been the biggest comfort character out there. I relate to his character and his upbringing, and his own character has managed to actually make me realize more things of myself and grow as a person. I also even write fanfiction of him, which I feel like is average for a girl my age so I am not that embarrassed. I also of course have a deep crush on him which I joke of with my friends, calling H my boyfriend and such (secretly I actually love these jokes, though I'm too shy to admit that, haha). In other words, H is an amazing character and I am surprised he is not anywhere near mainstream! Though I am glad as I can keep him all to myself now, haha.

I was having a rough day that day, my period had started, my dad was pestering about me going to high school (for health reasons I'll never be able to attend one which upset me a lot), and I was stressing over a theme coding project I had been working on for two days as a gift for a friend. I finished the code early this day and was too scared of sending it to my friend because I deemed it 'aesthetically unpleasing'. In the end I did send it, and then immediately deleted it. But then I realized that I deleted it too late, as now my friend had the code file. The absolute panic I felt in that moment before he revealed to me that he actually liked it! But what I didn't expect was for him to send something back for me. The squeal I let out when I saw it one would think I had won a million dollars! :) It was a drawing of H and me! Let me tell you that my friend is probably one of the best artists I've ever known or seen, so to get a drawing was a blessing itself. But a personal one of my ultimate teen girl fantasy no matter how cringe it was? My heart clenched and I swear I started to feel tears bubbling up inside of me. I am still continuing on expressing my gratefulness to him hours later lol.

He didn't even have to do that for me, yet he did. I am so grateful of my best friend and I absolutely love him with all my heart. It's things like these that make me grateful of meeting him and also of other people in my life, and that I am not truly alone. I wish I realized sooner how much he has done for me. Each time I think about it my eyes brim up with emotional and absolute happy tears. I've been so used to gifts and presents that never truly fit my interests or were considerate enough, but he? He knows me too well to know how to make me the happiest girl in the world. We both jokingly call each other brothers from another mothers, but I realize that I genuinely see him as one, which is making me far too emotional too living as an only child and being the only teen in my family and relatives, so I never had a close relationship like that with someone around my age.

Lesson of the day (for me at least) is that you are never truly alone, and that there are people out there who will embrace any part of you, even your embarrassing fictional crushes. And to also tell my friends more that I love them. :)"
happy,Started the year making better changes. Ive lost 19lbs in total since January.
happy,"There's this old couple in our hood, Mr. and Mrs. Johnson. Super cute. Mr. J decided to recreate their first date for Mrs. J. Picnic in the backyard, candles, the whole deal. Mrs. J walks in, totally surprised and thrilled.

They spend the evening laughing, reminiscing, just being adorable. Now here's the cool part – word gets out, and suddenly, the whole neighborhood catches this happy bug.

People start doing little nice things for each other – helping out, checking in. It's like Mr. J's love move sparked this happiness wave in the community.

Lesson learned? A bit of love goes a long way. One sweet gesture can set off a whole chain of good vibes. Who knew a recreated first date could kickstart a happiness epidemic, right? "
happy,"As an artist, I’ve never been as prolific as I have been this year and even though I beat myself up about it, it’s amazing to think back on the year about ALL the paintings I have done. I’ve probably done over twenty or thirty paintings this year of varying sizes and this was after YEARS of doing maybe just less than a handful. I think last year I did two or three. Prior to this year I was making friends who didn’t even know I was a painter or went to school for art. I’m proud to say that narrative has vastly shifted! I’m so proud of myself for painting more even though it’s really hard to get started some days."
happy,"I'm big into the local music scene as a local musician, amateur gig photographer, and just general lover of grassroots music. For my birthday, my boyfriend secretly set-up a non-profit music promoter enterprise, booked four of my favourite local bands to play at a local grassroots venues on my birthday weekend, and arranged for all ticket sales to go to one of my favourite local charities! 

It's without a doubt the most thoughtful thing anyone has ever done for me, and I'm totally blown away by it! 

"
happy,"
As Violet's third birthday draws near, just two days away, I find myself overwhelmed with a sea of emotions. It's astonishing to think that my little girl is turning three, and at twenty, I've already spent these transformative years as her father. Time has sped by, filled with both challenges and incredible rewards.

Discovering I would become a father at seventeen was a shock. A mix of fear, uncertainty, excitement, and a heavy sense of responsibility hit me all at once. The day Violet arrived, holding her tiny, delicate body in my arms, I was struck with awe. Her blue eyes looked up at me, her dark brown hair perfectly framing her face. At that moment, I vowed to myself and to her that I would do everything possible to give her a joyful, safe, and fulfilling childhood.

Being thrust into fatherhood at such a young age forced me to mature quickly. Balancing school, work, and parenting felt like a high-wire act. Sleepless nights, early mornings, and countless moments of self-doubt were my new normal. But each time I saw Violet's smile or heard her giggle, I remembered why I was doing this. She was my drive, my reason to keep moving forward.

Violet is more than my daughter; she is my greatest inspiration and teacher. Even as a toddler, her intelligence and creativity continually amaze me. Her boundless imagination and inquisitive mind remind me of the wonder and beauty in the world. I strive to nurture her curiosity and ensure she always retains a sense of wonder. Her strength and resilience reflect my own, and together, we tackle life's challenges.

My primary goal has always been to create a stable and nurturing environment for Violet. I work full-time, saving diligently so I can provide a place where she has her own room—a space for her personality to blossom and her dreams to grow. This journey to success is demanding, but each step is fueled by my desire to give Violet the best start in life. I want her to believe she can achieve anything, and I am committed to being the role model she needs.

Navigating shared custody with Violet's mother has been a significant learning curve. Though we were never together, we both prioritize giving Violet a loving and supportive environment. Effective co-parenting requires clear communication, compromise, and a shared understanding of our roles in Violet's life. Despite the difficulties, we've managed to establish a balanced routine for her, ensuring she feels loved and supported by both parents.

With her third birthday approaching, my heart swells with gratitude and pride. Violet has changed my life in ways I never imagined, and I cherish every moment we share. I also feel the rapid passage of time acutely. It seems like just yesterday I was holding her for the first time, and now she is a bright, imaginative, and intelligent little girl who amazes me daily.

Reflecting on these past three years, I see how much I have grown alongside Violet. Fatherhood has taught me resilience, patience, and the true essence of unconditional love. It has also deepened my determination to work hard and secure her future. As I continue on this path, I am constantly reminded of love's power and the resilience of the human spirit.

Sitting here, flooded with nostalgia, pride, and some anxiety about the future, I recognize that every moment with Violet is a precious gift. She has brought immense joy and purpose into my life. I am committed to being the best father I can be, ensuring she always feels loved, supported, and encouraged to chase her dreams. Together, we will continue navigating this journey, building a future filled with love, hope, and endless possibilities."
happy,"Dropped out of college in 2013, became a licensed cosmetologist in my state… worked hair full time for 9 years. Went back to school. 

Graduated, passed exams. I am a certified nurse aide. "
happy,"Grew up in a small poor town in rural midwest. First of my family to go to college. I did two years of community college first while working at the mall and lived with parents, then I transferred to University and I only needed a loan for my final semester. That was in 2012. Not gonna lie, I was pretty much couch surfing/homeless til 2014 where I decided to learn programming (my major in college was history, what a waste of time).

Got my big break in 2015, but still living on the edge and needed roommates until 2019. In 2022 I joined a tech startup which I am still working at. I have zero debt outside of a mortgage (got a house at 3% in 2022 whew!), and have savings of a bit over $500k thanks to some smart investing. I got married in 2019 and have a daughter, and life is pretty good as I get to work from home and my wife doesn't have to work. My hours are flexible at work as well as long as I get my tasks done, that's all they care about. No set hours.

After expenses we have about $3k left over every month to invest or do something fun with.

I am pretty happy. Hopefully it lasts."
happy,"This was filmed at their album release party this past January. I think it rocks and wanted to share. They’re on Spotify and are already ready for a second album this summer. Really happy for him, he’s the guitarist in the cowboy hat and wrote this instrumental!"
happy,I have been wanting to start a landscaping business for awhile now. The weather just started to turn the corner so I am going to go door to door after work today to see if I can get a little lawn care route going! I'm so exci
happy,Been slightly over 2 and a half years sober but my third birthday sober...working towards my third year this August and this pupper means the world to me. Hes my little buddy and I owe him so much.
happy,"Being funny and having a sense of humor and quick wit is something that's always mattered to me. Whenever somebody tells me I'm funny or laughs at my jokes it makes me feel really good.

I tend to have kinda shitty self-esteem so being told to my face something like that with any kind of regularity means a lot. It's nice to be secure in something that matters to me."
happy,"I've resisted unhealthy snacks today!

I've resisted, even though I've been tempted to have some because I'm quite hungry. I'm so happy, because I've gained almost 20kg due to my pregnancy and I desperately want to lose it so that I can feel good about myself again. 

Also, I plan on exercising today, even though it's hard to make time for myself. I've been so incredibly depressed after giving birth and, despite my hunger now, I'm not going to give in to having a snack because then I'm never going to make progress. 

I'm tired of disappointing myself and avoiding looking in the mirror. Today, skipping snacks and exercising is a small step in the right direction. I'm taking things one day at a time, one small step at a time. Please wish me luck! :)"
happy,"Ever since I was a teenager I wanted a pair but they were always too expensive for me. My BF took the plunge and for my birthday (which is in a month, but he wanted me to get the most out of these boots during January lol) him and my best friends split the costs on the gift. They are in the box next to my bed as I'm typing this. I feel like a little child that got a very precious toy and can't sleep without hugging it. I almost ran up the wall when I first tried them on.

I wanted to share this here. I feel bougie and expensive with these Demonia boots lol"
happy,"Hey All - Just wanted to tell someone other than since I don’t really have any friends. 

Got the promotion at work I’ve been working towards for the last 11 months. Over 125 interviews (internal postings) and I got selected. Beat out very capable individuals, some with 5-7 years of seniority. 

Pretty damn happy. Giving my all each and every day, without exception, finally paid off for me, for once.

happy,He’s so cute!!! I love him cause we both love dumplings and we’re both fun dumplings cause I think that’s way cute to say plus I got lots of candy it’s so much I love it! I usually have trouble deciding candy so I got Tootsie Rolls (my favorite) and a lot of the cute ones like gummy bears and gummy hearts and roses plus some gummy diamonds they’re blue and everything!!!! And that one that’s pastel blue and pink is called a Unicorn Gummy I think and I love love love LOVE unicorns🤞🏼😋!!! His shirt says “Hugs” and I got a cute bag that has him in and I got a picture with the giant giant bear inside I would’ve gotten an outside picture of the store but there were people there and I didn’t wanna stop on the middle of the walkway🙁 and the woman doing the bear fluffy stuffing was going to have me step on the button and I couldn’t (I have anxiety and got nervous😾) apparently a lot o people think they’re too old for this stuff?????? That’s crazy to me cause I never really thought like that cause I love Build-a-Bear and NEED the new Sesame Street ones !
happy,"in late august/early september me (15m) and one of my friends (15m) decided to fake date each other for fun and after about a week of playful “fake dating” a mutual friend dmed me and told me to message my fake lover, so i did and with some prompting he confessed that he had actually fallen for me and i had suspected thats what this was about (being prompted to message him) and i was incredibly excited, i had only recently come to terms with my sexuality as gay and was more than happy to accept his feelings, we kinda took it slow because i was pretty nervous to say actually romantic things but we are in a happy relationship for a little over 4 months now! this is the longest and healthiest relationship ive been in and i genuinely want to marry this boy. just wanted to ramble about my perfect boyfriend and how we got together


moral of the story: fake date your friend whos knows what will happen 🤭"
happy,You’re very lovely people. I wish you happiness and peace. I pray you are blessed and have a wonderful Christmas! May it be full of laughs and good food. I wish joy on all of you. Have a great Christmas Day!
happy,"
My parents don’t love me and haven’t for a long time and I’m happy with that. Recently, my parents have shown their true colors to a lot of people, especially me. I’ve come to learn that they have only loved me conditionally, if I provide something to them. They weaponize my siblings against me, try to financially cripple me, and just try to make me feel as bad as possible. Ever since I’ve been sure of what I wanna do for a career, my mother and sister have constantly belittled it. My mother has said that my sister is her favorite and my parents have always shown that for as long as I can remember. I realize now that they don’t love me anymore and I’m happy I can move on with my life. I’ve accepted that they never will for as long as I live, and I can finally grow and surround myself with people who truly love and care about me. "

happy,"My son loves to play outside. The house next to us is being rebuilt so it is unoccupied at the moment. There is a small pond located on the property so every now and then we venture over there to see what sort of wildlife we can spot. Yesterday, disappointment struck when we arrived to the pond and didn’t spot any animals. Normally there’s at least a few ducks, but not today. After about 10 minutes he looked down at the ground, picked up a very high-quality stick, and threw it into the water. The stick struck the water. The splash made him so happy he exclaimed, “I did it dada, I did it.” It took me a second but then I realized, wow he is so happy because of the stick hitting the water! Mind you, I have never thrown anything into this pond before, so this was just his primal instinct telling him “pick up stick, throw stick water, stick make splash, make boy happy”… anyways I thought I’d share this because it was enough to make a grown-man cry. Such simple acts can bring so much joy. We’re such simple creatures haha. Have a great day everyone

happy,She's asleep right now next to me. My phone took a poop so she said that I could use hers so I thought I'd make a post like this. You don't have to upvote I'm just posting it just for the sake of her finding it one day. 
happy,I’m 44. Never thought I’d have kids. Today that changed. Say hi to Annie.
happy,"Might not seem like a big accomplishment to a lot of people, but as someone who’s been constantly biting their nails until they bleed since like 6 years old (I’m now 16), this is a big accomplishment for me!! 

I used to bite them a lot when I was nervous, after panic attacks or after breakdowns, but for the last two weeks I haven’t had any urges to! My nails are finally long enough that I can paint them and they’re also the longest they’ve been in years! 

They might not be super long but to me they are! I’m hoping to let them grow longer and learn to do more nail art and stuff with them!"
happy,"Are they enough?

I moved away from family and friends to another state over 1000 miles away. It’s just my husband, two dogs and me. I work from home. I’m 52 years old and it’s hard to make friends at this age. Is it wrong that I feel content and dare I say happy with the limited companionship? Social media tells me I should have friends to hang out with on a weekly basis. 

I like hanging out at home with my pups and husband. I read and garden. We have fires and cocktails. 

Am I missing out? Should I be trying harder? I do go back “home” twice a year to see family and one or two friends."
happy,"Guys... I told my crush he's got a cute smile

So, here's how the conversation went: we were walking out of class together, it's the last day of the semester before I can't see him again, and we had this activity where we needed to compliment someone about them. 

We were walking out of class, and I told him: your smile is so, so contagious, Annd immediately he smiles incredibly wide at me, his two small dimples on the sides of his lips show, and it was the cutest thing ever, and super rewarding. Then we walk past a classroom with his friend in it, which he interrupts me, but my crush goes:

""SHUT UP, she's SPEAKING. Continue, please, continue."" So I do, but I tell him that.""Yeah, yeah, I know I'm boosting your ego, but it's like- actually super amazing, and..."" To which my face is pratically melting off, which he points out, telling me my cheeks are beet red.
Then says: 

""It's kinda hot, ngl"" I wasn't sure whether he said, ""Your face is super hot red,"" I was too dizzy from the amount of blush on my face. 

Then I told him it was just adorable and how I was gonna miss it. He's full-on grinning now before he begins to leave. AHHHHHHHHHG"

I have a student with so many allergies until he came to us he never ate in the cafeteria. he ate in a private room.

happy,"*Kevin Kelly* is a forward thinker, speaker and author. He founded *Wired* magazine and writes with great insight. Six years ago he turned 68. For each year of his life, he gifted a piece of advice to his children; things he wished he had known at their age. Each year since, on his birthday, he has added to that initial list. Below are ten pieces of advice from *Kevin*’s 74th birthday update, relating to happiness, habits and progress.

# Happiness

1. Where you live (what city, what country) has more impact on your well-being than any other factor. Where you live is one of the few things in your life you can choose and change. In my biased option, *Bath* is a beautiful city. It’s been my home for the last 30 years and brings me great joy.
2. The highest form of wealth is deciding you have enough. My instinct is to believe that if I had more money, I’d be happier. However, those richer and wiser than me have persuaded me otherwise.
3. You’ll never meet a very successful pessimistic person. If you want to be remarkable, get better at being optimistic. I can choose how I interpret the world. I chose to be optimistic with a dose of realism.
4. Asking “what-if?” about your past is a waste of time; asking “what-if?” about your future is tremendously productive. I can’t change the past, but I can influence the future.

# Habits

1. What is important is seldom urgent and what is urgent is seldom important. To get the important stuff done, avoid the demands of the urgent. I try to ensure that activities with longer term benefits are addressed.
2. If you are out of ideas, go for a walk. A good walk empties the mind and then refills it with new stuff. My daily walk gives me space to think and reflect. A life changer for me.
3. You have 5 minutes to act on a new idea before it disappears from your mind. If I have an idea, I note it down in my mobile notes app.

# Progress

1. The best way to criticise something is to make something better. I love building things and seeing others use them.
2. The more persistent you are, the more chances you get to be lucky. I find the concept of increasing one’s *luck surface area* to be an empowering idea. I try to position myself to take advantage of lucky breaks.
3. Decisions like to present themselves as irreversible, like a one-way door. But most deciding points are two-way. Don’t get bogged down by decisions. You can usually back up if needed. Few things in life are permanent. While hard to comprehend, this reality is liberating.

On Feb 15th I was 214 pounds .

happy,"After going through so much school, putting out so many applications, I was offered my dream role right after graduation and I am so excited and happy I can’t even sleep! Really just wanted to share how at peace and grateful I’m feeling in this moment :) "
happy,"
I've been in a really good mood lately. 

I just had a woman hit on me for the first time ever the other day. I was super nervous, but it left me feeling amazing.

And recently I've somehow (through no real effort on my part) managed to become surrounded by very thoughtful, kind, and genuine people.

I've felt more at ease with my life in general.

It almost feels like my world turned around on it's own, and it brought a lot of joy into my life."
happy,"I have a fear of needles, but I wanted to donate blood to save someone's life. A few days ago I finally managed to do so 😁"
happy,"Today I turned 33.  My boyfriend (33M) decided to take me on a small trip to a forest an hour away that he knows is one of my favourite places. 
Things were weird between us the the last couples of weeks but I was happy that we took the trip.
We walked through the woods and I was walking ahead of him and he called out my name. I asked him whatif everything is okay while still looking straight ahead. He asked me to turn around. There he was, holding a ring in his hands, smiling at me and he popped the question. 
I said yes. 
I still can't believe it happened .
I can't believe I'm saying this but I'm engaged and this is most definitely the best birthday I've ever had."
happy,"She told me near the end of January of this year that she is gay. Since then she's been a lot more sociable and is flashing that gorgeous, radiant smile of hers a lot more often. She called me this morning (her mom has custody on weekends) and told me all about this girl and their date, and it's the happiest I've ever heard her sound.

I am so unbelievably proud of my little girl. I'm smiling ear to ear thinking about how happy she must be to be living as her true self. She is my world, and her happiness is my happiness."
happy,I almost overslept on my last test but I made it and now I’m done with my third semester and how close I am to Graduation.. it’s crazy how fast.. life goes by when you do something you love!
happy,"i (f19) am in a long distance relationship with my gf (f22). things are really tight so i thought that maybe i wouldn’t be able to afford to get my gf much for valentine’s day. she calls me goose a lot and i ended up finding a stuffed goose that’s about my height! i also found some of her favorite candies and some face masks that she enjoys for a relatively affordable price.  i’m just super happy i got to get her some meaningful things, even if it’s not much. I included a picture of the goose (i got the largest one) :))"
happy,"I have been with this amazing, amazing Turkish girl since the 17th of September last year, and she hasn't done anything but making me feel loved, happy, and very confident of my future. My Damla is very lively, and to my ears, she has the most beautiful laughter that I have ever heard.
I am very thankful for the night that we told each other the ""I love you"", and so thankful for her existance in my life."

happy,"These little monsters just got some character for me each one a bit different yet some how they are all the samen monsters.

It’s fun to create and expand. 

What is your take."
happy,"To all my fellow singles out there and to those that are missing/can’t be with their significant other today, remember this:

You have the ability to light your own spark.  We all want that sense of completion with someone else by our side.  We all fantasize about being whole.  The over-commercialization of romantic love makes it even worse. The truth is, we are whole just as we are.  Sure we all come with baggage but that doesn’t make us incomplete.  This is your reminder that you don’t have to go through today feeling alone.  This is your chance to pour all of your love into the most important person in your life: you!

Right now, I’m sitting with a glass of my favorite (Verdi) wine, snuggling with Bruno the stuffed red dragon and my two cats.  I bought myself flowers again this year and added the purple rose because they are my favorite.  I lit my favorite Apotheke candle.  There’s salmon broiling in the oven that I’ll be pairing with  broccoli and basmati rice.  Later, I’ll cuddle under the blankets and watch a movie.  It’s all I’d want to do with a partner.  Why should being single change that?

How are you spending today?  I hope it is filled with peace and not a reminder of what could have/should have been.  Seize your happiness.  You deserve it."
happy,"I've struggled in the dating arena for years, only managing to get one or two first dates, from the apps. Last year, I realized I was asexual, and tried a dating site for asexuals. I started chatting with someone on there, and just met in person, and we really hit it off. "
happy,First week of college my girlfriend broke up with me because she wanted to hookup with a guy she met in class after begging me to come to college with her and being in a relationship with her for a year she successfully hooked up with him and kept me on the ropes for 7 whole months and I developed a pill addiction and asked her for help with it but she didn’t care a month ago I ended things with her it was then she realized she threw me away and took me for granted for that long and wants me back but I know after what she did to me I can’t go back it’s been a month now and I’m very happy I’m talking to a new lady rn and things are going good but why do I feel guilty ending things with her ?
happy,"I (19M) turned 19 on Tuesday last week and my girlfriend (19F) made it so special for me. She bought me a huge bunch of flowers and I legit cried so hard in her arms. Ive never been given flowers before and it meant so so much to me. For anyone reading this, buy someone you care about a bunch of flowers it will make their entire year!!!!"
happy,I've been using a Couch to 5k app that uses progressive overload to help you run a 5k. My mental health has been tanking so working out for MYSELF hits different. Potential weightloss a huge benefit. Anyways. Super proud of myself after being a potato for the last few years! 🥰😀
happy,"It wasan't my first choice initially - i was shooting for medicine. 
But being real, i have no idea what i want to do with my life, even tough i am now legally responsible for it.

Even tough im not sure if its the degree i will end up pursuing a career in, i feel like at lleast not stuck in place, nor moving backwards. at least the one or two, max three years that i would have ""wasted"" dropping out would let me be sure thay law school just wasant for me.

all in all, im pretty satisfied -when my parents arent breathing down my neck thinking i will just play games all year and not pass the year."
happy,"Growing up I was always in special education classes and have a real hard time learning. I was addicted to meth for 16 years and have been sober for 14. I started working at a treatment center in the kitchen, and never thought that I would ever have my own office able to help people struggling with substances. The thought of passing this test was so far-fetched. Anyway, on the 31st I passed my test and feel about 2 inches taller. And for somebody of my stature that’s a big deal lol I have been happy dancing all week. Now I have a career that I can provide for my 15-year-old son. Which I got full custody of when I was five years sober. Life is so good. If you’re struggling but doing the right thing, keep it up it pays off."
happy,"I was a mess for two decades, booze, coke, just whatever. I have now made it two years without a drink or any coke. I'm so happy right now. I was able to go back to school and I went from a 36 waist to a 30. I later gave up sodas and energy drinks, but alcohol was the tough one. Two years!!!"
happy,"I have always worked construction and trades jobs my whole life but a few years ago I took a leap and decided to do something with my creative side. It has always been my dream to work in a creative field as I’ve always loved art and design. So I’ve been going to university for graphic design for the past two years online. I’ve been working meaningless part time jobs in retail and maintenance to pay my bills while going to school. 

A little while ago my friend gave me a tip that his company was hiring and it’s in the industry. Long story short I beat the other applicants and was hired!!! I am now a layout editor for a media company. I specialize in newspaper page layouts. For the first time in my life I’m actually making a living wage and can afford to live normally. Nothing fancy but I’m doing more than just surviving now. I couldn’t be happier. Follow your dreams kids!!"
happy,"I didn’t think I made enough money but I submitted my documents and they said I make way more than the qualifying amount. This is my first big adult real-life payment, and I’m so excited to move in. It’s an awesome place. "
happy,"This morning I was going to work and it was dark but I saw my bf pass me on the highway on our way to work, I instantly got butterflies. Then when I got to the Dunkin drive thru who do I see in front of me….. it’s him. Lol I didn’t think he would notice but then when I got to the window to pay for my coffee the cashier said “here you go. The gentleman in front of you already paid” it’s the little things. y’all I’m so in love 🥰 "
happy,"Not that we are the type of people who stick to a planning but it is showing us that we have something’s that are definitely worth while and got stuff to be excited about! 

Like: we’ll be married for 10 years.

Our kids will each get at least 10 one on one dates  with either parent. 

There will be concerts and date nights 

Birthdays and an unicorn party 

I’m looking forward to a happy 2024"
happy,I absolutely love pineapple and strawberries! I buy them precut because it’s time consuming but one day I was rambling with my mom complaining about how expensive it is to buy precut fruits so she took it upon herself to buy some pineapples and cut them up and wash the strawberries! ☺️ I’ll finish them in like 2 days lol
happy,"Walked around the store today and smiled at a few people sharing glances. It's noticeable their expression changes before you smile at them vs. after. Like, yes old lady checking out the frozen waffles, you deserve smiles and happiness too. 🥰 Makes me extra happy when I do it to other people too, careful guys I'm contagious. You might catch it. 😂"
happy,Me and my wife have been together 20 years in October and married 16 in November. As long as I've known her she's been a smoker. I was a smoker myself. I finally kicked the habit three years ago. Bur my wife has been incredibly stubborn on the subject. Today we talked for a while and she decided to take steps to quit. I couldn't be happier with this decision. I'm aware that this will not he easy but she's at least willing. And I'm gonna stand by her and take all the crap that comes with quitting. If it means she can improve her health and I can have her longer I am more than willing to be her punching bag for a few weeks. I'm very proud because she really didn't want to do this. 
happy,"A day ago I posted about how happy and excited I was that I made a plan to visit my boyfriend suddenly! And he was surprised a lot! But today he surprised me back by proposing me 😅🥺 So apparently he had plans to propose me before but the ring wasn’t delivered on time , so he was planning to propose me later this month. But since I visited him suddenly, he took this opportunity to surprise me back by taking out the ring at this magical hike we had today. This is probably the best thing ever happened to me, the uno reverse we all need in life ! 😭🤍✌️"
happy,"I've been playing as a non-singing guitarist
in rock bands for a long time and finally started taking singing lessons 2 months ago to boost my confidence.

My wife has heard me sing plenty at home in private and has always given that supportive, but vague, ""yah, you sound OK"" response.

My instructor said I really had to own and believe in the lyrics of the songs I sing, so l've been working on singing with more feeling and expression.

We've been together for more than 30 years and I'm still crazy about her.

This morning I was hugging my wife, and while looking in her eyes, I started singing her the Beatles version of ""Til There Was You""...and she got quiet with watery eyes and a beet red face!  Then we burst out laughing.

My voice may not be perfect and I may be an old, but maybe I still got it!😻"
happy,"
I have been bullied for a lot of my childhood for various reasons and one of them was me being a little chubby (I was not even overweight) so it naturally destroyed my self confidence and caused me to develop anxiety and even depression at one point. I also struggle with binge eating while stressed. 

Now growing up my parents might have made a few mistakes here there that I could not handle but lately they seem to talk to me in a more positive and mature manner and it warms my heart. I know for a fact that they had to unlearn certain behaviours and ideas to have this outlook.


For example the other day I noticed that my favourite pair of jeans started ripping apart near the thigh area and I was beating myself up for it getting torn because I have put on weight since I bought them two years back. My parents casually reassured me that it was just a piece of clothing and I can always get a new pair that fits me perfectly. They also said clothes are meant to fit you and not the other way around . It might not sound much to them but for me it was a huge deal. 

Also I love dressing masculine and wearing clothes from men’s section all the time, even though I personally think clothes are genderless but corporate world doesn’t really think the same right, so we happen to have a lot of stores that exclusively sell menswear. When I first started to ask my mom to take me the store she immediately took me there no questions asked, she never says anything to me when getting clothes from the men’s section. I know this is how it should be but I know a lot of friends who aren’t allowed to do the same.  I mentioned this to her and she casually went clothes are for comfort and people can wear whatever they want as long as they feel good wearing them 😭❤️

These things may not look like a big deal to everyone but I know little me would be jumping with joy right now."
happy,"I GOT HIRED AS AN INTERNN AT LASTTTT

happy,"* I've been consistently going to the gym for a year and three months, and I'm muscular now.
* Also, I've been going for my master's degree in IT with a specialization in Software Engineering, and I have a 4.0 GPA so far.
* Plus, I've got a good clean conscience.
* Furthermore, I've been helping others in need.

* Now, I have a flexible and high paying job as an independent contractor.

happy,"Got my dog a toy today at a local ranch supply store. This was supposed to be the be all end all toy for destructive dogs. She managed to tear chunks out of it in 5 minutes flat. I wrote the company and said nice try, but it just didn't hold up. Company wrote back and said that only about 5% of dogs globally could defeat their rubber toys. As my puppy was one of those 5%, would I allow her to become a tester for their company? Heck yes, I'll let her do that. Whether they pay me, or whether they just send free toys, it's still a win for me and my American Bully XL.

ETA, this was an off brand toy, not the well known super duty one."
happy,"It's been a long journey with a lot of ups and downs, but I've finally found myself a job I can manage with hours that work for me despite my disability - and I thought I was doing ok, but it turns out I've been doing great! I work in health care and it's really important to me that my patients feel cared for and respected, so I'm overjoyed that I've apparently got so much positive feedback from my patients, as well as the other medical staff I work with. I'm not naturally a ""people person"" so it's pretty exhausting putting on my mask for every person who walks through my door, but this makes it feel worthwhile. 

To everyone who worries that they'll never be able to manage in the workplace, don't lose hope! When you're ready, keep searching and the right job could come along when you least expect it. I was struggling so much after years of trying to survive in the workplace that I ended up on a disability pension, deemed unable to work at all. Now I do five mornings a week, which isn't a lot by ""normal people"" standards, but I'm proud that I've made it this far. It's not the job I dreamed of doing and it isn't prestigious or glamorous but it's important work that I'm providing to the community. Everyone has something they can offer to the world, for some of us it just takes longer to find it. "
happy,"My boyfriend and I almost always play pool during our lunch break, more often than not betting something per game. Well, the bet we're cashing in this weekend is something I'm really looking forward to! We're gonna lay out blankets and pillows galore in the living room, introduce him to Star Wars for May 4th, order some ramen, snuggle puddle with my bunny (he loves my bf), and add pictures to our lovey dovey scrapbook.   
  
This man is so sweet, I'm truly able to let out my hopeless romantic side with him and get it right back without hesitation. Not to mention I just renewed my lease and we added his name to it! Having a safe and healthy love is one of the greatest feelings in the world. I love and adore him, and feel so giddy knowing he's just as crazy about me, too. :)"

happy,"So I came back from a long few days at this place and I forgot my phone, when I came back, my mom greeted me and she gave me my iPad. I was going back in all the stuff I had and all the games I was playing, but something I saw in particular made me cry tears of joy. My mom sent me messages in my iPad with pictures of her with my childhood toy with her at work, in the bed while she was sleeping, and sent me some texts wishing me the best, say8ng she loves me, and other stuff. I was crying tears of joy."
happy,"Undergraduate Completion

This story is about my journey as a college student and the joy I have at its completion.

I started my 5-year undergraduate degree in accounting during the fall of 2018. The first year was pure bliss; I gained so many friends, lost my virginity, felt heartbreak, expanded my understanding of the world and came to love diversity. I had earned a position as an RA for my sophomore year with one of my new, and still, great friends. 

Fall of 2019 started as the Residential Department put it, ""Gaining 60 new contracted friends"". I put my life into creating the best experience for both my residents and myself. Come March of 2020, this was shattered. COVID-19 officially shut down my campus and everyone was sent home. Uncertainty of the next year lasted until summer when our accepted return was announced. With many new rules and being shipped off into a different housing area, I was apprehensive to say the least. 

Fall of 2020 was the beginning of my hidden, yet sharp, mental decline. It is here my met my most sincere and closest friends beyond my home as well. The seclusion was otherwise agonizing and I had turned to drinking on the weekends with a small group of friends for the majority of the college year.  By summer of 2021, I had landed an internship in my field of study, entered a relationship, and received a promotion from RA to CA. The internship was phenomenal and the relationship amazing, though I found myself constantly crying and was put on am anti-depressant as depression runs in my family.

Fall of 2021, I was now entering the depths of my studies, additional responsibilities from my position, and my s/o was now 2 hours away. The anti-depressants dramatically worsened my mentality and became secluded from my studies, relationship, and job all at once. I dropped 2 classes in an attempt to reduce the load, to no avail. By winter of 2022, the relationship had ended in pain from depression+guilt and my education and job faltered further. I stepped down from my role as a CA to RA and took fewer classes to start the next year. Summer of 2022 was jobless in an attempt to regain my mental fortitude. 

Fall of 2022 did not last long. Immediately I was shunted into the same routine of depressive behavior, this time accompanied by suicidal ideation. As I was failing every class and effectively not working as is, I dropped out of college just before Thanksgiving to live at home and continue online next semester. Spring of 2023 I had begun seeing a psychiatrist as well as therapist weekly. My class load was very light as I was surely going to need an extra year to graduate. I tried new medications bi-monthly and my therapist was unhelpful for myself. I completed some summer courses but sank deeper and deeper in depression. 

Fall of 2023 was the worst time of my 24 years of existence thus far. Although my course load was still light, I had no point in living. I was divising painless ways to commit suicide and preserve my body for my family. I was ready to die when I started a new medication (Cymbalta) and started seeing a new therapist.

My life changed.

This medication with a dedicated therapist who cared about me and my wellbeing rocketed me out of the 6-foot hole. Within 3 months of dedicated medication rigorous therapy, I had finally stopped my suicidal ideation. Winter of 2024 was the first time I felt alive in almost 3 years. I felt pure happiness again for the first time 1 month ago. I am alive again.

As of May 11, 2024, I have walked across the stage, accepted my diploma for accounting, and am *effectively* depression free. I breathe as this chapter is completed. I felt the sun of my skin today, felt what it is like to be human. What it is like to be alive. 

I wanted to share this joy with others in hopes to encourage growth and foster hope. I am alive and far beyond well as I work to create the best me I can for the world.

happy,"We’ve had some pretty intense rain, heat and humidity over the past few weeks where I live, and it resulted in my garden going absolutely nuts with weeds. There wasn’t much I could do because it was either raining or so hot I would get heat stroke if I tried. So the last three days i spent a couple of hours each (still in the 30s Celsius) pulling the weeds. The first photo was taken after I had already pulled two garbage bags of weeds from the edge of the concreted space."
happy,"i had a psychologist to help cope with my overactive mind and imagination, and trauma from my last relationship and i can happily say that i regained control over my life and im so happy "
happy,"Yesterday, a mysterious someone left this poster and a bucket of flowers. The number of people walking around with flowers was astounding. Plenty of folks in my hometown needed a little happiness. :)"
happy,"
I met this girl two months ago online and I really adore how quickly and how mutually we have gotten close to one another, despite the fact that we started off as simply friends. It happened so naturally that it really felt magical in a way, none of it being forced, its like there was an unspoken agreement that we would be together lol.
She lives abroad, a timezone away, but I still cannot help but feel sure about here and I will get to pay her a visit really soon :).
And she really is the sweetest person I have ever met. She is respectful and caring to the point that it feels impossible for her to ever step beyond my boundaries, always being reassuring to even just remove possible wrong impressions of anything that might make me feel bad. We are capable of talking about any topic without disagreement and any worry without feeling unheard or judged. She started learning my entire language just for me (🥺) and she did not miss practicing it for a single day. I wish I could return the favor but I already know English lol. Shes really the best and she puts so much effort into being so that I dont think that will ever change. I hope I can be there for here whenever she needs it and I hope that she always feels how much I value her. I would take an oath to never stop taking her on dates if I could right now, regardless of what age we may reach together. And she looks so cute too like oml I physically melt when I see her smile, I really cant mess this up guys wish me luck lol."
happy,"I started a music project with two of my best friends a couple of years ago.  After releasing our first album I reached out to an author / reviewer to get feedback on what we'd put together.  I didn't get any feedback the first time around: this person was super busy so I didn't take any offence.  After releasing our second album I reached out again, still hopeful we'd get a listen.  It turns out this person liked our work quite a bit!  We got some very kind compliments.  I'm still smiling a day later. "

Started a new job in February and became fast friends with Amanda. Her friendship means the world to me. Even though she is 18 years younger than me. We just love being friends. Yesterday we got our nails done and had dinner and drinks.

We even got drinks that look like us 😂🤣"

 Edit: Can't really believe this got so much attention. Your messages feel amazing to me and I would love to post more of it as I save up and can start upgrading some things and making the room more 'mine'.

Much love to everyone!"
happy,"First there's A, she's been my number one bestie since we were 7! Me and her get together to watch bullshit reality TV and talk major shit about the men. She loves videogames and she 100% completed breath of the wild and working her way through the new one. She loves her younger brother and takes him on as many vacations as she can. She puts together the most perfect for you, beautiful thoughtful gifts which she presents for you artfully. She has a talent at art and also interior design and her place is stylishly decorated and immaculately clean. Her passion lies in the Library though and she's almost finished with her masters in library science while working full time as a receptionist but soon she'll be a librarian. She's also super fucking funny. When we get together it's allllways laughing.

Then there's B, she's only like a genius scientist and professor with a perfect SAT score who just landed a job at NASA working from home. ALSO she runs marathons even though she got long COVID and has heart problems now. Her goal is still to run in every state and she's still working her way through it. She also skiis, roller skates, rock climbs, and has completed iron man triathlons. On top of that she can also draw and recently she made her own stickers of famous rock formations (shes a geologist). She's the most emotionally intelligent human I know and crafts everything she says with the most delicate tactful gentle thoughtfulness without sugarcoating anything and tells you things to challenge your ideas and potentially harmful or toxic thought processes. She is also a good baker and sends me cookies in the mail a lot!

Then there's C, he's probably the most interesting dude I know although it took him two years of talking to me every day to actually open up about the history of his life. He's been to jail a few times for various things and he told me all about the people there and most of them were ok guys who just ran amock and got themselves in trouble (except for theives who were all around no good people) he's been a chef in fancy restaurants but he is keen on languages and very knowledgeable about them particularly those from the middle east. He originally wanted to be an academic until life took a turn. When he was younger he did martial arts, tended to carnivorous plants, was part of the orchid society, and went out into the wilderness to hunt rocks a lot. He got into bad accidents and was badly injured so now he can't really do the stuff he used to love. It makes me sad. But he's super funny in the most imaginative quirky way. And no one has ever made me laugh in quite the same way.

Then there's well, the other C. He's a young thing. He's a bright person with a promising future. He's in medical school studying to be a surgeon and he's recently gotten his masters degree in the top of his class. He loves videogames and he's quiet, reserved, values manners but he's not afraid of dancing. He loves a good party and night out. When I went to the uk and visited him, he showed me some of the castles in Wales of which he is very proud. He has a strong sense of patriotism about being Welsh. He is the most different from me of all of my friends from two totally different upbringings and worlds but somehow we never run out of things to talk about. When I get in my dramatic moods, He has a way of saying just the perfect matter of fact thing to drop me down to earth and I laugh as I fall. He is a complete nerd to the core but he has a little bit of a charming cockiness and confidence that makes me love the hell out of him.

I have a bunch more friends but if I told you about them all then this would be insanely long! So I just talk about the closest ones. "
happy,"I (31F) dropped out of school more times than I can remember I finished undergrad last year and found a master program that was tailored to exactly what I want to a T. I applied to this school twice in undergrad and got rejected. This has been the school of my dreams since I was a child, I grew up around it, supported the teams since I was a kid and always drove by it wanted to go to it. I got the acceptance letter today and started crying. Everything that has happened to me has lead to this point. The happiest moment of my life, if I can talk to my younger self who never believed she could end up here I would hug her. I can’t wait for this next step in my life."
happy,We had a long and semi mild winter but with the freezes and thaws it's taken my garden to bloom any flowers. These daffodils are usually also eaten or picked by my children so this has been so nice to enjoy their beautiful blooms.
happy,"She told me near the end of January of this year that she is gay. Since then she's been a lot more sociable and is flashing that gorgeous, radiant smile of hers a lot more often. She called me this morning (her mom has custody on weekends) and told me all about this girl and their date, and it's the happiest I've ever heard her sound.

I am so unbelievably proud of my little girl. I'm smiling ear to ear thinking about how happy she must be to be living as her true self. She is my world, and her happiness is my happiness."
happy,"Now i don't live on this subreddit, however ima write a thing that kinda makes me smile right now

In my school we got a class called ""musical"", volentarily, where basically everyone that is in his last 2 grades helps performing a musical (11th grade \[second to last\] helps, 12th (last) on stage). My teacher is doing this job for 20 years already, so he knows what he has to do, and what will happen. HOWEVER we are his first premiere, the first one to perform the musical ""School Of Rock"" in our country (Germany).

We've began to practice a few weeks ago, we knew our singing parts more or less already, so it wasn't such a big deal. Now that we are on our final days it starts to hit us, that we will be standing for so many people, singing, shouting and dancing. And boy/girl you don't know how happy i am. It might be that i am going crazy again, but boyyy/guuuurlll i can't stop smiling, it's gonna be nexxt weeeeeeek :D

It's all fun, of course sometimes we don't agree with everything, but mostly we (I) have fun"

happy,"For me, the first thing I used to do was check my emails but it was super stressful, and also my whole day would be bad if the email was crucial and msg was bad but when I stumbled across this quote from Sadhguru life isn't the same. 'When you wake up in the morning, the first thing you should do is Smile. You are Alive! Is that not the greatest blessing and reason enough to Smile?'  
  
So every day when I wake up I smile not towards anybody, I just smile. This very small act has changed my attitude to look toward life :)

happy,"23 Male and going through a Major Depression to the point I rarely get out of my bed unless I have to go to my shitty job.

I was just endlessly scrolling when I got a call from an old highschool friend of mine. What's funny is that I've always wanted to contact my old highschool friends but insecurities and self doubt always gets the better of me.

He called me to ask how I was doing, and of course I lied and said I was doing OK. He said he was doing fine too and we talked for a bit. And he also asked that we should hang out sometime, and said sure. 

I know it might seem sad and pathetic to be happy over a call but that made me feel good."
happy,"JNJDSB I know this might not sound like a big deal, but I've been so stressed about my storage because of how much I need for the software I want to install and because I can't convince my parents I need an additional drive because I own a lot of usbs already. But my usb with the largest storage...IT WAS NOT WORKING. *FOR YEARS.*

And so just few minutes ago, I found out...*I can reformat it, even though all the data would be erased, it would hopefully work*....

That doesn't sound that great, ***right?*** SO I PLUGGED IN MY USB TO REFORMAT IT AND IT'S PERFECTLY FINE??????????????

My guess is that a while I ago I was troubleshooting drives, transferring files, running security software and whatnot, and around that time I repaired the drive, but just didn't notice it or forgot about it. 😭

BUT I AM SO HAPPY. LIKE SO GODDAMN HAPPY. It's 1:43 am, I'm so happy I considered waking up my parents and my siblings to tell them that it works. I am so so so so so incredibly happy.

Like, there's so much things that were being held back because of this stress, and now it's like ***FREEDOM.*** **And like things are finally looking forward. AND THERE'S SO MUCH MORE I CAN DO NOW!!! SO MUCH MORE TO TEST!!!! I AM SO EXCITED.**   


AND I'M SO HAPPY THAT ALL MY FILES ARE THERE. I've been missing so many stories I've written and worked on, along with programs I've written, now I can finally get them back!!!!!!! 😁💖"
happy,"SO and I are gen x, come from suuuuuper broken homes. We met just over ten years ago, are celebrating our 9th wedding anniversary today. We’re having Jimmy John’s to celebrate while we save money for the move. 

He comes from the troubled teen industry, I come from your standard fucked up adolescence. 

We’ve been apartment dwellers since we met and have talked about a house but it had to be damn near perfect to make us commit. It was a long distance dream we clung to in our darkest hours. 

We found one.  Georgian Colonial, made from brick. It’s gonna last generations, like us. It has a small waterfall in the backyard, only a few neighbors, lots of trees and privacy. The Seller sat on the house until he found the “right” buyers and it turns out that was us. We got one hell of a deal. We’re paying less than half a mil for a house that’s worth 3/4 of a mil easily. 

We don’t feel like we deserve it but we’re damned if we won’t enjoy it. 

I’m a firm believer that the Universe gives you what you need. Not god, not fate, but something similar. I don’t know, but it seems like there was a time we needed something, and it’s been provided, and it’s not the first time. 

We needed a larger apartment? One was open in the same complex. We needed a family type car? First one we looked at was perfect. SO’s job sucked monkey balls? Here’s a random call about one and oh, hey, we’ll pay to interview and move you … 

We’re just so fucking happy right now and it sucks to share that with friends and family who aren’t necessarily feeling it. 

I wish I could share this feeling with all of you. 

"
happy,"It's been a long journey with a lot of ups and downs, but I've finally found myself a job I can manage with hours that work for me despite my disability - and I thought I was doing ok, but it turns out I've been doing great! I work in health care and it's really important to me that my patients feel cared for and respected, so I'm overjoyed that I've apparently got so much positive feedback from my patients, as well as the other medical staff I work with. I'm not naturally a ""people person"" so it's pretty exhausting putting on my mask for every person who walks through my door, but this makes it feel worthwhile. 

To everyone who worries that they'll never be able to manage in the workplace, don't lose hope! When you're ready, keep searching and the right job could come along when you least expect it. I was struggling so much after years of trying to survive in the workplace that I ended up on a disability pension, deemed unable to work at all. Now I do five mornings a week, which isn't a lot by ""normal people"" standards, but I'm proud that I've made it this far. It's not the job I dreamed of doing and it isn't prestigious or glamorous but it's important work that I'm providing to the community. Everyone has something they can offer to the world, for some of us it just takes longer to find it. "
happy,Happy family. 🙂
happy,So today I went for a run. Now when I starred I was doing interval training which I still do but today I made through half my route without getting winded or slowing down to walk. I feel amazing. I'm so happy when I make progress. 
happy,"I'm so so happy I looks at wedding photos and FEEL how much he loves me, how happy I am!"
happy,"Spring crocuses are a harbinger of good weather to come, much better than Puxatauney Phil, and a lot more reliable, doesn’t it give us all hope?"
happy,"We've only been dating for a few weeks now, but she is incredibly thoughtful--she made soup and dropped it off for me when I got covid over the holidays, we've made each other playlists and I am enthralled by the one she made me, she sends me really sweet voice messages when she wakes up and before she goes to bed, she says incredibly sweet, silly, and romantic things that make me blush for days at a time. I have never felt so safe and held and seen and attracted to someone all at once so quickly before. She is really forthright and curious and has a lot of integrity. I admire her a great deal and feel so lucky to be able to see who she is becoming (she is trans and has been honoring herself in some pretty big ways lately and witnessing that from the sidelines has been really beautiful and touching). I am not sure how long we'll be together but for now I am very grateful she is in my life. "
happy,"And, on top of that, we are both now throwing hard enough that the ball makes that wonderfully satisfying sound when hitting the glove.  Today is a good day."
happy,"In the first picture 140lbs, Second picture 216lbs. 6’4 btw."
happy,It was a cheap one but decided to try real Champaign to celebrate 
happy,"I moved into a small flat when I had my first child, we've lived here for a long time and grown our family and made do with what we had. The area we are in isn't the nicest but we always made the best of it. I started looking for something bigger for us 5 years ago. 
2 years ago we were broken into, (nothing taken, it was a drug addict looking for someone, but refused to believe they didn't live in our house), that same year a new neighbor moved in who vandalised cars on the street, picked fights with passers by, started giving sweets to children in their gardens when the parents weren't looking and he eventually broke into a girl nearbys home. (He didn't harm her just scared her and left)
Last week, I got a call that there is a house available via council housing and I can finally have something more affordable, safer and bigger for my children. When I showed my daughter the keys the first thing she asked was 'is it somewhere safe?' And I can finally say yes. I feel more at peace than I have done in years."
happy,"ljust need to let this out to some one but I'm finally happy in a relationship, my last one was exhausting and it was to the point that my new S/0 was confused why was so happy when she came into the store with me. I also almost cried when the first time I was at work and she stayed at my place she had cleaned the entire place just cuz, no one has ever done that and it ment so much to me,It just feels like such a great weight off my shoulders and made me feel something I've never felt before. I can't wait to take her on her first vacay in Sept to show how much she means to me and to spend time with he in Disney. 

Also wanted to let people know that love is out there, if this woman can love a 23 year old autistic guy with 10k in Legos, then there is hope for everyone out there."
happy,"I was infantry, and I used to feel a certain amount a guilt having never killed.  Think of it as survivors guilt in a way, of others have to carry that burden what makes me so special?  But the older I get, the more I’m just all around glad and relieved.  We all think we will be fine when we join, but as you mature you realize there’s no telling how you’ll react.  I can finally, at least for today, say I’m perfectly fine having never been in that situation.  Some may look down on this, but kiss my ass after Taco Bell "
happy,A small achievement 
happy,"23 Male and going through a Major Depression to the point I rarely get out of my bed unless I have to go to my shitty job.

I was just endlessly scrolling when I got a call from an old highschool friend of mine. What's funny is that I've always wanted to contact my old highschool friends but insecurities and self doubt always gets the better of me.

He called me to ask how I was doing, and of course I lied and said I was doing OK. He said he was doing fine too and we talked for a bit. And he also asked that we should hang out sometime, and said sure. 

I know it might seem sad and pathetic to be happy over a call but that made me feel good."
happy,"I got the Sony WH-1000XM4’s and they’re so amazing. The sound quality is so nice and I can’t get over the noise cancellation feature. Everything is so quiet and I feel so much calmer. Noises put me on edge sometimes when I’m overwhelmed (often), so they have just helped a lot. :D"
happy,"I know it’s probably not a crazy good accomplishment; especially because I know I’ve hurt people before, but I’m still proud of myself nonetheless. 

I used to be defensive, snappy, and easy to push into sadness or anger. This was due some previous life experiences. Which doesn’t make it okay. It never does, but I feel like me getting better and being a better friend and person to those around me is a sign that I’m moving on from that. I’m healing. :)

I’ve been in and out of therapy my whole life; which never really worked until I became an adult and was able to truly think for myself and be myself. 
Now; after two years of panic attacks and mental decline, I think I’m finally getting better. I’m kinder, I’m more generous, I’m able to take criticism. I’m still sensitive, but I try to remember the intention of others before reacting in anyway. I’ve also learned to take time for myself incase my emotions get too high. (Something I was INCAPABLE of doing before) 

Okay, sorry for the wall of text; I’m just happy to be doing better. Thank you, if you made it this far. 

Remember to be kind not only to others, but also to yourself. :)"
happy,I remember just a few months ago I couldn't even do 10! Let alone get down and do some more afterwards!
happy,"My dad has been quite unwell for several years now. He's been through chemotherapy, he had a hip replacement after an accident and he's lost the use of his kidneys so he has dialysis 3 times a week.

As a result, his memory has been affected to the point that he will ask me two or three times if I want a cup of tea/coffee before he remembers to make it. He also tends to forget what I do for a living or misinterprets it, but I don't mind.

I went and stayed with him for just over a week last month and while I was there I mentioned I was starting a new job today, but to be honest I wasn't even certain that I told him the exact date I was due to start.

This morning, I received two messages from him on Facebook wishing me luck in my new job that I started today. I wasn't expecting it at all given his poor memory but he probably wrote it down somewhere because he knew I was excited about it.

:-)

happy," I am so happy. Today I was able to get my own room after having been homeless for a few months. Lost my job and previous home and this last two years have been rough, but definitely back on track now. What a blessing!

 Edit: Can't really believe this got so much attention. Your messages feel amazing to me and I would love to post more of it as I save up and can start upgrading some things and making the room more 'mine'.

Much love to everyone!"
happy,i look good and i feel good - hiking five miles every morning has been glorious and the views here are chefs kiss! just wanted to share that little slice of sunshine. :)
happy,"I didn’t think I made enough money but I submitted my documents and they said I make way more than the qualifying amount. This is my first big adult real-life payment, and I’m so excited to move in. It’s an awesome place. "
happy,"I just started a new job 3 weeks ago. On the first day of training there were 2 other people in a group with me. We instantly clicked and have been having lunch together and texting each other everyday since. 

We each are going through breakups and while at different stages of healing, they are just so positive and supportive. It’s been really good for me. They are also both super healthy and workout regularly which is really impressive to me and has motivated me to get off my ass! lol  We even signed up for a hot yoga class this weekend! 🧘‍♀️

We were all texting last night saying how we felt we were supposed to meet one another. Just makes me feel grateful for being able to meet new friends at 43 and especially at a time when my heart is missing who I thought was my person so much.

happy," 

On Feb 15th I was 214 pounds . Went on a low calorie diet and eating only once or twice a day of lean chicken and 3 veggies and only drinking water/water with no sugar flavoring. 40 minutes at 3mph daily on the treadmill and 20 minutes daily of benchpresses and curls . Today I'm at 198 !!!!!!! Still got a ways to go my goal is 180 but getting there!!!!

I'm excited."
happy,"Like the title, I’ve moved far away from home and I had never done this before. I always lived in the place where I was born. I honestly never even thought I would move. Last year, I was promoted to manager for a company and I had a LOT of work to do. I needed help, but then lost some accounts and didn’t need as much help anymore. Someone told me early last year that they should’ve taken the opportunity to move back home when they had the chance (to my hometown - he was helping me for a while, and he lived 400+ miles away.)

It was a seed in the back of my mind to POSSIBLY eventually move. His best friend moved to my hometown to help me full time. Meanwhile, I grew feelings for a friend who said he was moving to where this guy lives. I still thought about moving, but thought there’s no way I would move for a guy just because I like him. (We aren’t in a relationship, but I am crazy about him. lol) 

Well, as luck (or fate?) would have it, I lost even more business at work through no fault of my own. I was desperate for a change because I needed to make more money. I don’t have a roommate and I have bills I need to be able to pay. No other job applications were going anywhere. My friend that I mentioned above suggested that I move out of my hometown, and I thought it might actually not be a bad idea to have more work in a bigger city, like he said. I thought really intensely about it and talked about it with my closest friends and family. 

Even the guy who worked for me was afraid of losing his job. I told him not to worry because I was thinking of moving to take his best friend’s place - he was in a hard spot financially too, and would have help in my hometown to get back on his feet. Every single person I told about the possibility of me moving said to 100% do it. (Well, aside from my parents, but they have been supportive even when I told them my crush moved away. I thought they were the crazy ones for that. LOL)

I got home from vacation after thinking long and hard about moving, and I drafted the email to send to my boss about moving to two possible locations. One because I had family there, and the other because I KNEW the other guy wanted to move earlier in the year back to my hometown. I had just spent my vacation near where he was living, and I liked it - but I was NOT thinking of moving when I took that trip. Lo and behold, when I got back home, I nearly went negative in my bank account. I had to return socks and underwear because I just couldn’t afford it. My car payment was coming up and I was so scared. 

I thought about if I were to move, what amount of money would I need to do it? The number $5k popped up and I figured that would be just enough to move. I had no idea how I would get the money. As if by magic, within 3 days, I never went negative in the bank and I had $5k to my name in addition to everything I needed for bills that month. My boss was totally willing to facilitate the move and the guy was desperate to move back home, even though he didn’t WANT to leave. He HAD to leave. 

It’s just been amazing how smoothly this has all worked out. I was terrified of moving here because I don’t know anyone very well, but I do have some friends in the surrounding areas whom I hope to get to know better. The cherry on top is that the friend I have feelings for lives here too, but I am not going to push anything with him. I didn’t move here FOR him, but it’s definitely a big perk, in my opinion. I don’t even know if he likes me at all. But it’s just so weird how everything has panned out. I am not complaining though. I absolutely adore this place already. 

All my life I thought I would hate it up here. I can’t think of a single negative other than my small family and my closest friends aren’t here. However, since moving, I am actually talking to my friends and family MORE than before! They care about my whereabouts and how I am doing so they are checking on me more often and making more of an effort, which is really nice. 

I am just so elated to be here in my quiet little bubble - in a beautiful city, which so far hasn’t given me anxiety much at all, despite it being so much bigger than where I am from. Everyone has been so incredibly friendly and, again, everything has been so smooth. It feels like it was meant to be. My mind is blown by this experience and honestly, it’s only been 48 hours, but I don’t think I’ll ever move back home unless I absolutely have to, and even then, I am sure it would be temporary."

happy,"Grew up in a small poor town in rural midwest. First of my family to go to college. I did two years of community college first while working at the mall and lived with parents, then I transferred to University and I only needed a loan for my final semester. That was in 2012. Not gonna lie, I was pretty much couch surfing/homeless til 2014 where I decided to learn programming (my major in college was history, what a waste of time).

Got my big break in 2015, but still living on the edge and needed roommates until 2019. In 2022 I joined a tech startup which I am still working at. I have zero debt outside of a mortgage (got a house at 3% in 2022 whew!), and have savings of a bit over $500k thanks to some smart investing. I got married in 2019 and have a daughter, and life is pretty good as I get to work from home and my wife doesn't have to work. My hours are flexible at work as well as long as I get my tasks done, that's all they care about. No set hours.

After expenses we have about $3k left over every month to invest or do something fun with.

I am pretty happy. Hopefully it lasts."
happy,"It's been impossible for me (66F) to find anybody locally who knows enough about this to treat me, and the Mayo Clinic turned me down as a patient because I don't have the worse, more dangerous level of the disease, just the basic really shitty form of it.

I recently found out about Ketamine being used to treat chronic pain✅ trauma✅ depression✅ anxiety✅ *and this mast cell disease*✅, and five days ago I started on a daily microdose protocol. (The Ketamine works on the trauma *and* makes mast cells **calm TF down**, which helps the depression, anxiety, and pain, which will help calm down my nervous system, which will improve the mast cell symptoms, which include all of the above except the trauma.)

I didn't know what to expect because the disease makes my body think I'm allergic to virtually everything, but I haven't reacted noticeably to the drug at all. I haven't been optimistic at all about my future since my diagnosis, I'm so excited!"
happy,"The day me and this cutie met irl, we were supposed to go on our first date. Instead, I totalled my car 2 hours from home and 2 hours away from him (I'm ok!). He drove all the way to get me from the tow shop, drove to my hotel and stayed with me so I wouldn't be suffering alone because lawd I was some pain from being jarred so hard! Despite the dramatic start, our second date weekend was amazing! We went to a festival, watched Tenacious D's Pick of Destiny, I introduced him to Puerto Rican food and culture, and best of all, he met my grandma and she loves him! I am so happy, sooooo happy! I feel so lucky. :)"
happy,"I had a girl I’ve been dating over for dinner and drinks last night to celebrate NYE.  Things started getting physical so I suggested going to the bedroom.  It was a hard no.

I was a little bit puzzled (we’ve had sex before).  She then informs me she has her period, appears visibly upset and apologizes.  I sort of start laughing; now she looks puzzled.

I tell her I’m chuckling at the apology; there is absolutely no reason to be sorry and I couldn’t be happier just giving her a kiss at midnight and waking up beside her tomorrow (she’s never spent the night).  I offer her a heating pad, pillows and to run out to grab some midol; whatever she needs to be comfortable, she need only let me know.

The result was a lovely young lady, stunned by the thoughtfulness and filled with appreciation.  Though I invited a ‘date’ over for dinner, we decided to become exclusive and I woke up beside my new ‘girlfriend’ the next morning.

What a great start to 2022.

Edit: inclusion of exclusivity."
happy,"These little monsters just got some character for me each one a bit different yet some how they are all the samen monsters.

happy,"I can't believe I have been using this app for ten years!! Cheers to another ten and many, many more after that.  "
happy,"Okay, I have that sweet sweet christmas money left and have two things I could spend it on, bread making supplies or a guitar. Id use the guitar more, but I don't have enough and will still have to save. I *may* get a guitar for my birthday. I already got something though so maybe I should wait for the b-day money for the guitar. I pick up on string instruments quickly. I really love music and writing songs and having an acoustic is key. I only have an electric and I cannot play my dads guitar because i just don't *feel* it. If you're an instrument player, you may know the feeling of playing an instrument you just don't feel in tune with. I love making music, but baking makes me super happy too. Id like to make bread and sell it and Im pretty good if i do say so myself. Maybe this money can help me buy the guitar? I may have already made my decision by the time people reply because I'm impatient, but I'd like to see your ideas."
happy,"I'm celebrating today!
I found out a lot about myself during this year because of reddit and people here.

thank you all, folks!"
happy,"My boyfriend and I were cuddling yesterday and he told me he wants to be the father of my kids one day. I’ve always wanted a loving and respectful man who would want something long-term with me and I also aspire to be a mother who raises a cute lil family of my own one day, so I was squealing on the inside when he told me this :) I hope everyone and anyone can experience love as amazing as this if not better 🥰"
happy,"So I’m 17 and an engineering intern. I started last year mid-February and it’s been going pretty good. At Christmas, I got a $330 bonus ($200 after taxes) and I was super happy with that. Today, my boss stopped by my office and said they usually give out year end bonuses but their system wasn’t working right this year so it was a bit late. He said to remember that I’m only really part time and when I said I appreciate it no matter what he said “it’s better than a stick in the eye”. 

So after he said that, I thought it was gonna be like $100 max right, but I open it and see ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS!! It’s $640 after taxes and I know that isn’t a ton to some people BUT I AM SUPER HAPPY. And yesterday I found out I’m getting $1500 back in taxes so I am going to be absolutely ballin!!!! HELL YEAH!!!"

I unfortunately have to go to school tomorrow morning, but for what its worth, I've not been entirely suicidal lately!"

happy,"So I've worked for getting on 6 years now 

Been senior support for about 3-4 years. Which involves working 24 hour shifts 

For the last year or so I've been doing a lot of the manager work without the extra pay, this is because the current deputy was not really able to do the tasks 

Well I was having a bit of a moan over the Easter bank holidays because I had finished three 24 hour shifts when the regional manager started sending me a series of tasks for some reason (my bosses boss) and I did it all promptly while moaning at myself for being a push over 

Turns out the regional manager then asked my boss why I'm not the deputy as I seem better for the role.

This lead to a discussion with the current deputy who said that she is more than happy to step down from the position for me to take over 


So I'm happy to have gotten recognition from someone high up the chain but also I will now only be working one 24 hour shift a week and will have 16 hours office hours throughout the week 

Also I still get a pay rise of course aha "

happy,"Spring crocuses are a harbinger of good weather to come, much better than Puxatauney Phil, and a lot more reliable, doesn’t it give us all hope?"
happy,"With things as grim as they've been the last few years, I decided I'd get a bit of summer work last year while I was off uni so I could fund a long weekend on the seaside after, as well as a trip to Berlin I'm looking to do with my friends this summer. To cut a long story short, I got a job at uni working in the applicant call centre, where people who were meant to be joining this year could phone up and make enquiries.

A-level results day (I'm from the UK) rolls around and sure enough we get a load of people calling up who've not had the right grades for the course they wanted. Basically, the process is that we ask them for their grades, look up what other relevant courses they'd be eligible for, then forward them on to the department if there's space and they're interested. We have one option called a Foundation Year, where you only need a CDD or something like that to be eligible. You basically do a year of baseline work in your subject area to show that you're competent, then you can go on to do the course you originally wanted.

I took 90-something calls that day, and referred about ten or so people on for foundation years, along with a small handful of other people for other courses. I worked about 12 hours that day, and so I went for a pint afterwards to unwind. I remembered a couple of years prior when a friend of mine didn't get the grades he needed and had to call up the uni, so I've seen how hopeless people can feel when they have to do it. While I was drinking, I had this realisation that, thanks to my intervention, those people were able to still find a way into the uni they wanted to be at. I hadn't had a great past year at uni myself, and so I felt like I'd actually served a purpose that day for the first time in ages"
happy,"I (31F) dropped out of school more times than I can remember I finished undergrad last year and found a master program that was tailored to exactly what I want to a T. I applied to this school twice in undergrad and got rejected. This has been the school of my dreams since I was a child, I grew up around it, supported the teams since I was a kid and always drove by it wanted to go to it. I got the acceptance letter today and started crying. Everything that has happened to me has lead to this point. The happiest moment of my life, if I can talk to my younger self who never believed she could end up here I would hug her. I can’t wait for this next step in my life."
happy," I am so happy. Today I was able to get my own room after having been homeless for a few months. Lost my job and previous home and this last two years have been rough, but definitely back on track now. What a blessing!

happy,"I've been pretty depressed for several month and I just started to get better. I've develloped a crush on a old schoolmate that is really beautiful and out of my league, but I'm not pessimistic of my chances.

We talk a little bit on instagram. Nothing more nothing less. It is nice even tho nothing is really happening.
I didn't saw her in real life for like 3 years. Only on social medias

This morning I took the Subway to go to work and I saw her in the train. God she was beautiful !
She left after just 4 stations but that was such a cool moment for me.
Nothing happened, but just the fact that I got the opportunity to see her in real life made that day a bit better :)"
happy,"See the before and after, but this fireplace hadn't been touched in years and was not being used

I ripped out the old tile, poured a new base, pressure washed the fireplace, painted the cast iron, used lemon juice to clean the barss exterior, and retiled the entire thing

Thank God for YouTube"
happy,"My bucket list is filled with things like running with the bulls, paragliding from the summit of Mt. Blanc and climbing Mach Piccu, many things I won’t likely get around to, leaving my bucket unsatisfyingly shallow. 
My anti-bucket list has simpler and more achievable goals like removing unhealthy eating habits, avoiding overcommitting myself and purging toxic people and negative influences.
This bucket is filling up much faster and I’m finding longer term happiness rather than short term excitement. "
happy,I was able to buy the house mostly using money my mother left after she passed away.  And I think she'd be proud and happy knowing the hard work she put in while she was alive helped give me a new chance.  She always wanted me to live happy and now I am.
happy,Today is day 1 of no contact after being married to a narcissist for 8 years this is the hardest thing I have ever done in my life I’ve lived through the abuse the torture the cheating the lies and yet I miss them but today I started making a list every time I want to call them I add to that list a reminder of all the things my brain made me forget all these years I am hoping this is day 1 of a life without being controlled 
happy,"in late august/early september me (15m) and one of my friends (15m) decided to fake date each other for fun and after about a week of playful “fake dating” a mutual friend dmed me and told me to message my fake lover, so i did and with some prompting he confessed that he had actually fallen for me and i had suspected thats what this was about (being prompted to message him) and i was incredibly excited, i had only recently come to terms with my sexuality as gay and was more than happy to accept his feelings, we kinda took it slow because i was pretty nervous to say actually romantic things but we are in a happy relationship for a little over 4 months now! this is the longest and healthiest relationship ive been in and i genuinely want to marry this boy. just wanted to ramble about my perfect boyfriend and how we got together


moral of the story: fake date your friend whos knows what will happen 🤭"
happy,"The day me and this cutie met irl, we were supposed to go on our first date. Instead, I totalled my car 2 hours from home and 2 hours away from him (I'm ok!). He drove all the way to get me from the tow shop, drove to my hotel and stayed with me so I wouldn't be suffering alone because lawd I was some pain from being jarred so hard! Despite the dramatic start, our second date weekend was amazing! We went to a festival, watched Tenacious D's Pick of Destiny, I introduced him to Puerto Rican food and culture, and best of all, he met my grandma and she loves him! I am so happy, sooooo happy! I feel so lucky. :)"
happy,"I'm 33 weeks pregnant and my husband's bday is Monday. Money is tight and I couldn't take the day off work so this weekend I've been working really hard to make it special. Yesterday made him breakfast, homemade angel food cake (with fresh strawberry toppings), and we went to his cousins for an epic hot pot dinner. Today is his 'lazy' day where he wasn't supposed to do anything but relax. This morning I made breakfast again, cleaned the kitchen, and did laundry. I was super exhausted and laid down to watch a movie. Shortly after my husband comes in with this! The plate was full, but I was so hungry I started eating before I took a picture. My hormones are crazy right now but I'm just so happy! I even cried a little."
happy,"Not only was I drinking out of despair for my unfortunate life, but I was making my life more unfortunate with drinking. I was depressed. Couldn’t hold a job. Was in debt. Unhealthy life habits and terribly unhealthy, both physically and mentally. Had toxic friendships and relationships. Deep down I hated myself and thought it was the life I deserved, and I couldn’t ever live a happy life. 9 months ago I decided to change that. My whole life has turned around! I’ve lost weight, am finally experiencing true happiness, have a wonderful partner and meaningful relationships, am constantly working on making my self and life better, and may even be able to retire before I hit 30.  Oh, and I am nearly 3 months sober of weed as well!!!!

Today is such a good day. "
happy,Change is a bitch. 
happy,"After long hard months of grinding applications, interviews and dealing with the anxiety that comes along with it I have finally received a job offer from a company that I really like.

I know these moments of happiness are short lived, but this is one of the bigger milestones I’ve achieved in my life and I am extremely proud of myself.

Always remember that if you are willing to work hard enough to achieve something that it is always possible! Don’t give up!"
happy,"I have always worked construction and trades jobs my whole life but a few years ago I took a leap and decided to do something with my creative side. It has always been my dream to work in a creative field as I’ve always loved art and design. So I’ve been going to university for graphic design for the past two years online. I’ve been working meaningless part time jobs in retail and maintenance to pay my bills while going to school. 

A little while ago my friend gave me a tip that his company was hiring and it’s in the industry. Long story short I beat the other applicants and was hired!!! I am now a layout editor for a media company. I specialize in newspaper page layouts. For the first time in my life I’m actually making a living wage and can afford to live normally. Nothing fancy but I’m doing more than just surviving now. I couldn’t be happier. Follow your dreams kids!!"
happy,"My two kids from a previous marriage now have mom, dad, AND papà. They looked so happy during our little ceremony; even my generally stone-faced teenager couldn't help but smile. Husband's parents served as our witnesses, and we had a lovely day together. We also have our honeymoon to Japan in a few weeks, which I'm beyond thrilled about. More than anything, I feel gratitude. For an amazing, intelligent, and funny partner, and for the wonderful and loving papà my kids have gained over the last few years. My life has gone from the very dark place I was born into to this...it feels like a fairytale. I have my partner, my babies (shared time with their dad, but for several months at a time which is great for us with school,) and then university finally, and just generally life is stable and good. I didn't know where else to share but I'm just really happy. :)

Edit: To clarify, we met on reddit 🥰"
happy,"It feels like I’m dreaming. Two of the hardest years of my life are finally over. I also got a job offer yesterday. Everything always works out in the end, I just never thought that it would work out this good."
happy,"There used to be a falling down house across the street from me. Some realtor picked it up on a property tax sale and tore it down. Should have been no big deal and just a normal tear down and rebuild, right? Along the way, I noticed it was taking forever to build 2 homes they decided to build on the lot. It's been almost 2 years since construction started, 1 house is complete, the 2nd is about half finished. I'm home with a work injury, so there isn't much else to watch but this build and the boob tube. And of course, my dogs go berserk whenever people show up over there.

Dogs are going off one day and I look to see what set them off. It's a mold abatement company. I didn't really think too much of it, and a year passed before the house was complete. My friend tells me after she has signed the contract that she's moving across the street from me. That's when the alarm bells went off in my head. I let her know to be thorough in her inspection because they'd already treated this brand-new home for mold. Her jaw hits the floor, and she says that the owner/realtor (both are the same person) didn't disclose that.

There are other problems, like none of the dirt from digging in water lines, nor any gravel in preparation for driveways and sidewalks being compacted. None of the cement has rebar to reinforce and strengthen it to stand up to our winters. The un-compacted water line trenches run under both driveways. I guess hauling off piles of dirt wasn't a clue to the builder that it might be a problem later.

Final inspection day comes, and it takes 2 pry bars operated by 2 fairly large men to get the access to the crawl space open because it's so wet in the crawl space it has made the wood swell quite a bit. Not only is the crawlspace infested with mold, but against code, the crawl space wasn't built with any ventilation. So my friend got out of the contract, and the owner/realtor will likely lose her real estate license for not making proper disclosures.

Yes, it sucks that she has to look for another house, but she's so happy she didn't get stuck in a mold infested trap. And funnily enough, you can hear fans running from over there 24/7 in both houses."
happy,"Howdy! 

I'm so appreciative of all of y'all's support! I was worried if I was overstaying my welcome on this sub, but y'all were so supportive! For anyone starting their fitness journey from my posts, or anyone who is in their own fitness journey, I'm so proud of you! I'd like to address a couple thing so constantly see in the replies. I'd rather address it on the post instead of individual comments. 

I do infact know I need a calorie deficit to lost consistent weight, and I've been on a calorie deficit since day 2

No, this is not a karma farm. Anyone who values karma so much they lie and take advantage of peoples kindness is an idiot. If you still believe this is a karma farm, that's fine but please don't be rude to or others who just want to improve their lives.

Yes, I know I'm fat, I know I'm unhealthy, you don't need to constantly spam in in the replies. Please come up with more insults because I'm running out of jokes.

Almost exactly a year later I have my license, l've bought a car, I'm buying a house with my best friend and now boyfriend (who I've been in love with for months), I have an amazing job lined up, moving out of my state to somewhere heee much better for me and safer.

happy,"I (M25) remember deploying to the Middle East and staying up until 2-3am in the middle of the desert sleeping on a litter (the medical kind) watching the Matthew Stafford led Lions beat the Matt Ryan led Atlanta Falcons. I was also there when we traded for Jared Goff. My Marines (I was their corpsman “medic”) were from Southern California so I got a lot of grief, but nothing could tear me apart from my home team.

Years later, I remember my girlfriend breaking up with me. I got drunk and sad while I watched the Jared Goff led Lions beat the Matthew Stafford led Rams, winning their first playoff game for the first time in 32 years.

It sounds dumb how much a sports team could effect your mental health. But fuck man, I needed that shit so fuckin badly both times. I often think about the happiness that team gave me when I was at my lowest, shit gets me every time. 

I lived all across the country and had plenty of people just chirp in my ear about how I should just give up being a Lions fan and just join their fan base and I never did. There’s something special about facing adversity or how ____ and ____ isn’t good enough and coming back on the other side better, showing them they were wrong. I think we can all relate to that in some level. You can say it’s dumb, it is a little… but that made me happy and that’s all I need.

happy,"I shouldn’t be writing this since I’m about to go to bed

  
But sitting at my work desk I was feeling a little stressed about life

  
But something made it all go away

  
I closed my eyes… and starting imagining

  
Imaging my future

  
A future where I’m with my future daughter and I’m pushing her on a swing

  
She’s smiling so much and laughing and calling me daddy.

  
\-you can make it weird, but honestly it was super cute

  
I could clearly see her face so happy

  
Then another time

  
We’re at the beach and she’s older, a teenager

  
And the next scene I’m on my death bed with 5-7 kids around me

  
I’m smiling and they’re crying

  
In the present, the me who is sitting at my work desk is also smiling befause I’ve realised

  
There is no reason to be stressed

  
Thjngs can’t be bad forever, they never are, the only way to make it out of a stressful situation is to keep going and having hope.

  
Key lesson: start doing positive future visualisations when you’re lost.

  
They’ll change your life  
I hope this post is valuable to anyone feeling lost.  
Let me know what you think. What do you guys like to visualise, or think about, which makes you happy? :)"
happy,"Are they enough?

I moved away from family and friends to another state over 1000 miles away. It’s just my husband, two dogs and me. I work from home. I’m 52 years old and it’s hard to make friends at this age. Is it wrong that I feel content and dare I say happy with the limited companionship? Social media tells me I should have friends to hang out with on a weekly basis. 

I like hanging out at home with my pups and husband. I read and garden. We have fires and cocktails. 

Am I missing out? Should I be trying harder? I do go back “home” twice a year to see family and one or two friends."
happy,"
I've been in a really good mood lately. 

I just had a woman hit on me for the first time ever the other day. I was super nervous, but it left me feeling amazing.

And recently I've somehow (through no real effort on my part) managed to become surrounded by very thoughtful, kind, and genuine people.

I've felt more at ease with my life in general.

It almost feels like my world turned around on it's own, and it brought a lot of joy into my life."
happy,It's Spring! I am so happy when I hear the birds and frogs on my walk to work.
happy,"I just wanted to share it with somebody who can appreciate it. I am a young aspiring writer and I have never got actual recognition for it before. It's a small contest, but I am still incredibly overjoyed by it. It was a short story, but I mostly specialise in those anyway. It feels so awesome to have someone see my work and like it.
I'm not even excited about whatever my reward will be. I'm just happy someone read that little story and enjoyed it."
happy,"Recently I suffered an accident at a grappling competition. Large fracture on my right leg and 2 smaller ones near the ankle. 

&#x200B;

You would think this is a extremely low point in my life to get such a crippling injury, well you would be quite wrong. Part of is perhaps that in the end I will make a full recovery after a few months so I would be left in the end with just the humbling experience and the attitude that people now have with me.

&#x200B;

I used to think my friends are only friends with me because I am to use of them and because we have similar hobbies where we train together. Used to think I was the after thought of my family as the middle child. My feelings were always less important than my sisters, I was always supposed to support them if something happened but it never felt like it was given back.

&#x200B;

Well not only has my family offered help to even moving in with me to help me out and interrupting their lives to do so, not only have my friends all offered to drive me to the hospital and come to my place to play board games and entertain me, and even offering to do my university work but even random strangers on the street stopping their cars and asking me where am I headed and to drive me home. Old women offering to carry my bag and even the meanest looking face tattoo dudes offering help without even being asked or remotely needed.

&#x200B;

I am a 23 year old dude, used to feel alone in the world where nobody would care if something happened to me to now feel like society actually cares. Ofcourse Ive had a negative experience too but positive experience outweighs easily the one bad experience. To the people that are like the ones that help, thank you, you have no idea how much you help. I certainly would strive to become more like the selfless people that helped me when I fully recover. And dont judge the mean looking people by appearance, maybe thats how people also viewed me before, they turn out to be the most sympathetic of them all."
happy,"

My professor had embarrassed me in front of the whole class because I did not know one answer. He started asking me my name and throwing comments about how I don't know anything and all. He made me stand in front of everyone. Nevertheless, I, someone who's suffering from anxiety disorder and severe anxiety, someone who gets embarrassed so very easily, for the first time, did not get embarrassed. 

I was pretty chill tbh. I did not have a raised heartbeat, I did not feel extremely sad, I did not panic, I might have had a few tics but that's it. After he left, I just went about doing my job and honestly I was impressed with myself. Idk whether this happended because I have a bigger embarrassing situation/trauma to deal with such that this felt so small or because I was already tired of everyone's sh!t. 

It happened and I'm honestly kinda happy."

happy,"Where I live, there’s practically nothing on this road, other than apartment complexes, a school, a few house (all neighbors in the houses get along really well-) and a little corner store ran by an older Asian woman.

I am the type of girl who wears that ‘emo aesthetic’ as my mom calls it, but really I wear skater/street wear and it drives her insane. Today I am meant to go to a meeting and dress nice, so I put on a cute little dress and a cardigan matched with black heels my sister let me borrow.

My mom asked me to go get some coffee from the store, and I accepted happily so I can see the Asian lady since I actually enjoy the small talk we have when I’m checking out. When walking there however, my heel had broken outside her store, and I went in any ways with a hop, and went to get the coffee, but she had stopped me.

She took a look at what happend, and the grabbed green string and told to kneel down, and I did. She started wrapping the heel in string, and fixed it temporarily. I thanked her Atleast 20 times before I had checked out and joked about it with her for a bit.

She really made my day so much better and I can’t thank her enough, even if the trying didn’t hold all the way there and back, it still was a nice feeling and made me really happy."

And I got 100% in my favorite class of all time!!

I helped them a lot with their applications and talked through deciding where to apply, etc. I've been getting periodic texts from them over the last few weeks as they've received their admissions (and one rejection so far) and it's been such an honor to share in their excitement. They even said I'm one of the first people they want to tell and that just put me over the moon.

Today they got an acceptance into a BIG school and one that was sort of a ""shoot for the stars"" application and I just shrieked and hollered when I got their message. Tears are streaming down my cheeks, but they are happy happy tears. What a privilege to be able to experience this joy with them. Truly an honor. I'm so lucky."
happy," just wanted to tell everyone,to start to appreciate the little things in life.The last two years I have been trying to find happiness and their have been ups and down,I lost some friends and I am even ashamed to say that I have been jealous of my friends having success because I didnt.Today I can say that I love my life,this is because I learnt to appreciate everything.In every single negative aspect in ur life there is something positive and and always remember that.You fight w friends or family,remember that u have friends or family and you are most likely fighting because u care for each other.You woke up in the morning ate  you ate food,thank god and if u dont believe just appreciate that u have food and a house to sleep in.Struggling with exams,you are doing exams u have an education and a future be happy,a negative always opens a door to a positive.Its normal to be jealous about something or someone you cannot stop these feeling but you are in your own path and your time will come and be happy for the person,good for them.

happy,I am in 9th grade and I was just going through so kinda rough times my ex was spreading rumors and her friend (a boy) wanted to jump me with a group of friends and it finally stopped. I had a track meet today and I couldn't run in the meet because I got injured in gym class (sprained knee). So I was taking times for all the running events and this one girl (senior) did a really good job on hurdles. When I got in the car the first thing I did was add her on snap to give her congrats on doing so well and it turned into us getting to know each other and then I asked her if being an adult is hard and she told me it wasent and reassured me it's actually fun because you can drive and get more jobs. We ended up talking about our plans for out of high school. This girl helped my fears of adulthood and actually made me exited for it.
happy,Started the year making better changes. Ive lost 19lbs in total since January.
happy,"NSFW for mention of suicide 

This time last year I was lower than I've been. I remember having to pull my car over because I was crying so hard I couldn't see. I remember sitting with my loaded gun and the only thing that stopped me is kids often go to the park I was in. I remember trying to wreck into a semi after a particularly bad day. For years I was so depressed and so low I never imagined things could be this good. 

But now I wake up everyday overjoyed. I go to work and even though it's work I love it. I shower and I don't sit and cry. I ride with my windows down and sing along to my music and thank my God that I'm alive to see today. That I didn't opt out before I turned 18 like I thought I would. That I made it to 22 like I didn't believe I could. That I wake up today at 25 happier than I've ever been my entire life. I smile and I laugh and I love and I took control of what made my life so awful and kicked its ass until I had full control. 

I think back on all those years I spent unhappy and hating myself and harming myself and I wish I could talk to old me and tell her that it does get better. It takes a long time and alot of shit but you come out on top. 

25 is so young and my life is so full now and I just wanted someone to know. I'm just happy and that's all I've ever wanted and all I'll ever want. I'm just happy to be happy yall"
happy,"So, as the title says, I started driving today. It was a motorcycle, no less. For some context, I'm 26 and never been in the driver's seat.

I've had Daisy (name of my bike) about as long as I've had a motorcycle license - about a year - but I haven't been able to put her on the road for various reasons, the funniest of which being the government and insurance companies typically don't like it when your 500lb death rocket was purchased with a lawn mower battery installed.

That's not all of it. Daisy needed a lot of work. But she finally met all the requirements to be put on the road just this morning, and I rode all day today. Let me tell you, it was worth every drop of sweat, every frustrated cuss, and of course every penny.

I knew driving would be fun, but I never could've predicted the extent of such. I was so calm just driving around my neighborhood. Everything could go wrong, and I knew it. But I didn't care. If it happens, I'll handle it like I was taught. All I could feel was joy."

he knows i was really anxious about going to work today so he got me a cup of coffee and brought it to me at work before he headed to work himself. i feel so happy i could cry. he takes such good care of me and i really couldn’t ask for anyone better. he’s my whole world :)"

happy,"So I have a lazy right eye and I'm right handed for everything.  When I look through the scope I don't  have an easy time lining up the scope because my left eye is dominate and tries to take focus. When I close my left eye, my already squinty eye gets worse. So I haven't shot in years because its so hard. 

I decided I needed a new hobby that got me outside so I started practicing left handed. After an hour or so I had the gun sited in. The tree is 75 freedom units away. I taped it so I could see if the pellet hit or just took the bark away. 

The second pic is me trying to hit the ribbon, then trying to hit the same hole. Didn't work.  You can see the 2nd small nick. That was from 30 fu's free hand.

happy,"Today's been a really lovely. I felt so at peace handwashing antique quilts in textile cleaner to remove the yellow age stains so they become like new again, just a couple spots need to be patched up and already have some choice fabrics in mind (got some really nice cotton calico prints at a free sale a couple years ago and a few nice quilt squares at a church sale). Save that project for a rainy day. Went out to some yard sales today and got some nice antique furniture for really cheap and some work clothes. I love looking at how they joined wood furniture back then, no nails or screws, just complex wood joinery and yet it's so unbelievably sturdy. The solid cedar wardrobe needs to be stripped, sanded and stained with a wood oil but it's lovely and has a cute little mirror and hanger and everything. I really loved how helpful the gentleman selling it was too. He helped carry the furniture into my vehicle and he just seemed really kind and gentle. His mum raised him right. Something about this being his mum's furniture is bittersweet. That's the wonderful thing about these older pieces, they're loved and I hope whoever takes on these pieces after me, loves them equally as much. I do wonder sometimes who the craftsman is behind all of this. It's kind of paying tribute to his art and how it carries on after death. 😊🥰"

Hi, i just got in high school last week and I didn't know anyone except for a friend of mine that ended up on the same school as me. A friend of her  also ended up there (wich i didn't know until yesterday). I just think it's worth to say that my social skills are terrible (expected from a reddit user lol), and i just find so difficult to start conversations, meeting people and stuff like that. On the first week i was dead silent, didn't talk to anyone, i was too shy and embarrassed, and felt like i would be a inconvenience to anyone just trying to stay in peace. Then yesterday (second week already), that friend of mine and her friend were talking to each other and they came to my desk to say something, and just stayed there for the rest of the lunch break, and we talked for a while until the class resumed. But today was even cooler, some of the teachers didn't show up on class, and we just talked the entire time about our lives. And believe it or not, it gets even cooler: we live in the same region, so we get the same buses on our way to home, and guess what: we talked the entire way lol. It just feels so nice to have someone to talk with that isn't on the internet, i was really missing that in-person social interactions haha.
Anyway, i think I've never typed so much in english, I hope only the best for y'all, cya ;P"
happy,I was in a bowling league for 4 years up until 2020 and they had to end the league due to covid. I got super unmotivated about everything and I didn't rejoin when it opened. For Christmas I asked for a new bowling ball because I want to play in a league again. I got my ball but leagues aren't available yet so I've been practicing on my own. I'm already better than I used to be and more consistent. My previous record was a 217 from 2019. Last night I bowled a 213 and then a 224. I'm gonna light up the league 😊
happy,"We've been dating for a little over a month now and she just called me babe. No other petnames were used prior to this. I thought I honestly hate the word, and you know, maybe I still do, but it made me so insanely happy. She did use it in a joke so it might've been ironic but I do not care. I'm giggling and kicking my feet and even after sending a string of keyboard smashes and I love you's I'm giddy and need to tell somebody. Thanks for listening. I love her very much.
edit: I'm very disappointed in this community my replies explaining I'm in a poly relationship were downvoted for no reason. This sub is meant to be happy. And accepting. I changed the last sentence. Hope that makes your day better."
happy,"2 years ago, when I told my family and friends I wanted to release all original music as a fully independent artist, and try to turn it into a full time living, almost everyone I knew didn’t believe I’d get very far… I know realistically the vast majority of people that try don’t get far, so I could understand where they were coming from (the music industry is insanely hard to make a living in). But I would never know if I didn’t try…So I did. And I worked so hard, and so many times I asked myself why I was doing this…So many times I wanted to give up. But looking at this milestone, I feel very happy and proud that I didn’t give up. I’m also earning a decent part time income from my music too! The next goal is full time! Just thought I’d share this, and to not give up on your dreams if you truly love doing them! :)
"
happy,"This admittedly isn't a giant achievement, but it made me happy. Ever since I was a little kid, I've wanted to have Minecraft on the computer, I idolized a lot of MC youtubers back then ( such as Amylee33, StacyPlays, GamingwithJen, dantdm and stampylongnose) and wanted to do what they did. And now I finally have it on my own pc! I luckily managed to save enough for my mom to let me get a card to buy it with. I plan to make a bunch of builds soon!"
happy,Sorry the picture is lame
happy,"I didn’t even interview, she said she knew she wanted to hire me for the position which shocked me as it was not the position I originally applied for. I know I won’t get paid right away but it’s something my landlord (hopefully) will work with. I haven’t had any money coming into this home for the last 3 months and to start working in a field I have been wanting to be in, brings tears to my eyes. 

I hope this is long enough and fleshed out more so it won’t get flagged. I NEVER post things that are private but with this win I feel like maybe I should start sharing with the world a bit more. Thank you for taking the time to read this message. "
happy,Just wanted to share. 
happy,"There wasn't anything special about it really. I just got back from helping my partner move a 9 hour drive away to school. I was driving back feeling very lonely, thinking about a lot of things, life in general. Called various family members and caught up with them. I finally made it home, got settled and took inventory of the food situation. Lots of ancient leftovers in the fridge. I made the ground turkey into taco meat, got the standard fixings together on the tortillas...

My God it was magical. Sometimes you feel like you need a good cry but then you have a good taco and everything is okay and you realize you don't need to cry. The universe put you right where you belong. You are strong. Things are pretty damn good and you get to live a very nice life.

I hope you all have a great night!

happy,Edit: Guys I’m blown away from the feedback. I wasn’t expecting this to get as much love as it did. I think it just goes to show that happiness can be simple and doesn’t require any extravagant justifications for sharing your feelings. r/happy is such a great community. 
happy,"There was this local Mexican joint housed inside a run-down, little-used gas station. Classic ""hole in the wall"" type setup, which should have been this community's first clue that the food would be stupendous. They had these chorizo burritos with spicy sauce that just spoke to me on some metaphysical level.

Unfortunately, last summer they announced they were shutting down. They just weren't making enough money. I was despondent -- nothing else in this two-horse town even came close to approximating the culinary excellence this place provided.

They reopened yesterday. I was finally able to get in there today, and I swear to you that the clouds parted and angels sang as I took my first bite. It's every bit as good as I remembered.

I'm recommending them to everybody I know and hoping they manage to hold on this time."
happy,"I'm so happy seeing her cuddled up in her old bunk bed this morning, we did something right huh? She still wants to be around us lol. "
happy,I have schizophrenia. I was never happy until I had kids. My kid did a play and I thought her role was so cool. They did game of thrones with Disney princess. Called games of tiaras she was snow white mother of dragons every one died and she got the throne. I was so happy. My life suck at her age my got beat up everyday.my sister wanted to be a only child. My uncle beat my aunt my other uncle beat his kids. My sister was raped. My dad held me and family hostage at gun point. I doing better. 
happy,My birthday is in 2 days! (6th april). Felt like 'treating' myself for once again [been extremely stressed so i kind of forgot about the whole self-love/worth/whatever-thing hahaha] and just thought if im already turning 16 i might aswell get myself the books i've been wanting for so long😊🩷
happy,"I haven't had sushi in about 3-4 weeks. That changed when my parents surprised me with sushi! I was in the middle of an online class when my mom walked in (I had the camera and microphone turned off) and gave me two pieces of sushi. When I took the first bite of that first piece of sushi, it REALLY hit the spot. It just felt soooo satisfying and soooo delicious when I took that first bite. When I took that first bite, I felt that amazing feeling when you taste sushi for the first time and end up loving it so much that it becomes your favorite food. I've never felt this satisfaction and fulfillment like any other when satisfying a sushi craving like this particular moment.

I'm pretty sure that this is what a foodgasm feels like, cause I don't think I've ever felt this before when eating food, let alone trying certain foods for the first time.

I don't know if there are any more words I could use to describe this feeling."
happy,"Okay, I have that sweet sweet christmas money left and have two things I could spend it on, bread making supplies or a guitar. Id use the guitar more, but I don't have enough and will still have to save. I *may* get a guitar for my birthday. I already got something though so maybe I should wait for the b-day money for the guitar. I pick up on string instruments quickly. I really love music and writing songs and having an acoustic is key. I only have an electric and I cannot play my dads guitar because i just don't *feel* it. If you're an instrument player, you may know the feeling of playing an instrument you just don't feel in tune with. I love making music, but baking makes me super happy too. Id like to make bread and sell it and Im pretty good if i do say so myself. Maybe this money can help me buy the guitar? I may have already made my decision by the time people reply because I'm impatient, but I'd like to see your ideas."
happy,It's Spring! I am so happy when I hear the birds and frogs on my walk to work.
happy,"There isn’t much that brings me pleasure anymore but i am so grateful for warm blankets. I just put a blanket in the drier until it was warmed up, i took it out and laid under it for a few seconds and it was one of the most pleasurable things I have ever felt in my life. I just felt so safe, so comforted and loved and even though i was completely alone i didn’t feel like it at all. All of the tension in my body just completely went away and breathing became so easy, my lungs felt so open and every time i breathed i could feel my breath traveling throughout my whole body. The pleasurable sensation that started in my chest began to expand, until it expanded to the blanket itself. I didn’t even feel like a separate entity anymore, nothing was separate, all that exists is warmth, and every aspect of my surroundings including myself is a part of the Great Warmness. I was so affectionate i started smiling so intensely and i felt so happy i started crying in the middle of nowhere. It was beautiful. Why is a heated piece of cloth capable of this?? Even though it only lasts a few seconds, it makes everything around me seem perfect and it makes everything seem okay. It’s the only friend i have. I love the warmth of heated blankets so much and i am so thankful for its sweet embrace, i don’t deserve it at all"
happy,"A while ago I wanted to download a game from my childhood because I remember really liking the music. I'm waaay too old for anything in it of course and don't have kids but I wrote a review baisicly saying that it made my childhood and that even though I've grown out of it I still adore it. I checked today and found out that the creator of the game wrote back a review saying ""We were so pleased! We are extremely glad that we brought happiness to your childhood! This is our goal! Thank you very much for these words on behalf of the whole team! Be healthy!"" (Translated from bulgarian). Actually crying tears of joy this was so sweet."
happy,"Just the sunlight dancing off the water,
And the weight of his arm around her shoulders."
happy,"My mom, who is literally one of the most thoughtful and kindest people I've ever and probably will ever meet, owns a storage place where she keeps all of her things that she sells. Sometimes, if she knows the person and knows they're struggling, she will give them things for super cheap. Like one time she sold someone she knew was struggling two nice brand new thick comforters for 4 dollars. She's very well known in the area for this and sometimes people will come and knock on her door just to give her stuff that they don't want, just because they know she'll take it and do good with it.

I always had a little pink mini frigidaire that I kept some of my beauty products in and I loved it dearly, but a few months back it stopped working. I never made a big deal out of it but my mom knew of it. Well, she kept it in mind apparently when today she came to me and gave me a practically brand new, perfectly working, mini black frigidaire that one of her friends didn't want anymore. Just because.

My mom is always reminding me that I can have anything that I want in her storage, she even insists on it when I tell her that I want to pay her. She will shout at me and say ""No! Take it! I don't want your money!"" I'm really grateful to her because I'm surrounded by really beautiful things (both vintage and non vintage) because she lets me have anything I want. I'll just look at something for two seconds too long and she'll ask ""You like it? You want it??"" It's funny really.

When she gave me the frigidaire I told her just how grateful I was and that I felt really lucky to have a mom like her. She said to me that I reminded her of herself at my age and that she once said the same words to her mom, who also owned a storage full of stuff that she would sell. Her mom (my grandma) was the same way and gave her whatever she wanted for free. It's no wonder I was surrounded by very pretty, sometimes downright luxurious looking things growing up too!

I know it's a bit superficial, it's not the only reason I am grateful to my mom, but it's just how thoughtful it was. It made me really happy. I'm glad to have a teensy fridge again too."
happy,"I’ve done an emotional 180 over the past two years for the better! These books have helped me more than therapy, antidepressants, and sleeping pills. Some of them contain spirituality but can be enjoyed by any religion. I tell everyone I know about them and just wanted to share here!"
happy,"I wanted to share this online to give some hope. We can do this. Love you all, take care ok? ❤️"
happy,You can do it too!!!
happy,"I don't have a college degree but scrounged hard to climb a ladder and managed to get software engineering level 2 yesterday! My boss asked to talk to me and I thought it was about a new application I they had mentioned they wanted me to work with but he had an offer letter for me to sign instead!


I don't really have friends or family to talk about it with so l'm posting here if that's okay. Started from an entry position analyst to engineer in 5 years, now I'm here after 4 more years. I don't have my parents anymore so I guess I'll look for phrase on Reddit 🩷"
happy,"I want to reciprocate with a meal subscription because he eats to live on weekdays(mainly due to work) but I want to change things up so ideas are welcome! Also, how do people keep the sparks alive when they are physically away from their partners? "
happy,I have been wanting to start a landscaping business for awhile now. The weather just started to turn the corner so I am going to go door to door after work today to see if I can get a little lawn care route going! I'm so exci
happy,"So, my brother and I were walking to the store just to pick up some stuff. We got in and I went to the drinks section, to get a flavoured water. Some kid who looked a little older than us was half-way blocking the drink I needed to get (I don't care, I'm really patient), and when he noticed, immediately apologized and moved. I felt bad, I said ""no, it's alright!"", and he mumbled something inaudible to me afterwards, but smiled, so did I. 

My brother and I got our items, and were waiting in line. It was just the guy from the drinks section in front of us. He payed for his stuff, then handed a 10 dollar bill to the worker, and said, ""That's to pay for them"", pointing to us, whilst exiting the store. We thanked him, and he said ""You guys are nice"", and he was out of the store. It all happened really fast, but it paid for our stuff. We left and his dad or someone was already driving away. He waved, and we did too. It was just really sweet I thought. I hadn't had that happened to me before."
happy,"Today I turned 33.  My boyfriend (33M) decided to take me on a small trip to a forest an hour away that he knows is one of my favourite places. 
Things were weird between us the the last couples of weeks but I was happy that we took the trip.
We walked through the woods and I was walking ahead of him and he called out my name. I asked him whatif everything is okay while still looking straight ahead. He asked me to turn around. There he was, holding a ring in his hands, smiling at me and he popped the question. 
I said yes. 
I still can't believe it happened .
I can't believe I'm saying this but I'm engaged and this is most definitely the best birthday I've ever had."
happy,I’m living proof that we *DO* recover!
happy,I can’t even describe this. I feel so light and nice and light and my head is spinning 
happy,"I was accepted by my top choice college a couple of hours ago, and I'm really excited!! It's not selective whatsoever - the acceptance rate is around 85%, but I was still really nervous. My GPA isn't the greatest - only around 2.9 at the time of admission, because I had a rough sophomore year and was out of school due to an eating disorder and was in a treatment center hours from my home. I will never be able to fully explain to anyone how awful and scary that experience was for me. It's amazing because that really felt like the end of the world, and to see now that I have a lot more to do in my life feels super weird (but good!). I worked my ass off this past semester and scored a 28 on my ACT, and I can finally say I'm kind of proud of myself."
happy,"We’ve had some pretty intense rain, heat and humidity over the past few weeks where I live, and it resulted in my garden going absolutely nuts with weeds. There wasn’t much I could do because it was either raining or so hot I would get heat stroke if I tried. So the last three days i spent a couple of hours each (still in the 30s Celsius) pulling the weeds. The first photo was taken after I had already pulled two garbage bags of weeds from the edge of the concreted space."
happy,"A day ago I posted about how happy and excited I was that I made a plan to visit my boyfriend suddenly! And he was surprised a lot! But today he surprised me back by proposing me 😅🥺 So apparently he had plans to propose me before but the ring wasn’t delivered on time , so he was planning to propose me later this month. But since I visited him suddenly, he took this opportunity to surprise me back by taking out the ring at this magical hike we had today. This is probably the best thing ever happened to me, the uno reverse we all need in life ! 😭🤍✌️"
happy,"I'm really excited about it! with this job I can get my own place and actually afford to live on my own with money to spare! 

All signs on their end point to actually wanting me as an employee too! I actually feel like this could be a new start for me! like really! For once, I'm excited about my future!"
happy,"It's a new day. I woke up with air in my lungs, a body that can move. The people I love inhabiting this same home with me. They are what makes it home for me. A warm, safe place that I'm heading to for work. 

This is life and even in the simple moments it is breathtakingly beautiful."
happy,"It's been a long time coming. I haven't been able get more than a buzz for about four years now on account of how high my tolerance is. My lungs have begun to protest as well. I've had it in my mind for a while now that I need to take a lengthy tolerance break. Whenever my weed is about to run out I tell myself that this is it and that once it's gone I would begin a several month long break.

What always happens is I will smoke my last bowl and then find myself walking over to the dispensary that's literally a two minute walk away and buying another ounce. Last night I finished smoking my supply and I didn't buy more. I didn't buy any today either. The dispensary closes in 13 minutes and that will make it official.

For the first time in probably five years, I chose not to smoke weed. Tiny milestone, but tomorrow I will abstain again, and the next day, and the next, and the next."

happy,"My son loves to play outside. The house next to us is being rebuilt so it is unoccupied at the moment. There is a small pond located on the property so every now and then we venture over there to see what sort of wildlife we can spot. Yesterday, disappointment struck when we arrived to the pond and didn’t spot any animals. Normally there’s at least a few ducks, but not today. After about 10 minutes he looked down at the ground, picked up a very high-quality stick, and threw it into the water. The stick struck the water. The splash made him so happy he exclaimed, “I did it dada, I did it.” It took me a second but then I realized, wow he is so happy because of the stick hitting the water! Mind you, I have never thrown anything into this pond before, so this was just his primal instinct telling him “pick up stick, throw stick water, stick make splash, make boy happy”… anyways I thought I’d share this because it was enough to make a grown-man cry. Such simple acts can bring so much joy. We’re such simple creatures haha. Have a great day everyone

happy,"It looks like no big thing, normal achievements for most people, but 2 years ago I was depressed, no job, no money, no friends, single, my mental health wasn't good at all. Now I'm working, I have a job, I met a girl that I really like, she became my girlfriend, and I started to work out, I've gained a few pounds, my physique looks better now.

I'm really proud of myself and feeling happy. I felt like sharing it because depressed people can change their life for the better, it's not easy but it's possible!"
happy,ALPACAS!!!!! (:
happy,We had a long and semi mild winter but with the freezes and thaws it's taken my garden to bloom any flowers. These daffodils are usually also eaten or picked by my children so this has been so nice to enjoy their beautiful blooms.
happy,"I’m so excited. This is a job I’ve wanted for ages and I feel like people take me seriously and respect me professionally, which I’ve never really experienced as I’m still 20 and in college. 

I get to go to a new city I’ve never seen before, go to fancy dinners every night and get paid for it!! Also I feel like I’ve made my dad proud of me so that’s an added bonus. "
happy,I've been exercising and training everyday. I reach one goal and improved on another. Every morning I do fourty sit ups. Now I get the fourty in but I have to usually do them I sets of ten or take a break. Today I did a complete set of fourty with no breaks all one set so I'm very happy about that. Also yesterday in my running I went further than usual and was less winded. I run in intervals so I was less winded in intervals. So I'm very happy about those things.
happy,"I'm big into the local music scene as a local musician, amateur gig photographer, and just general lover of grassroots music. For my birthday, my boyfriend secretly set-up a non-profit music promoter enterprise, booked four of my favourite local bands to play at a local grassroots venues on my birthday weekend, and arranged for all ticket sales to go to one of my favourite local charities! 

It's without a doubt the most thoughtful thing anyone has ever done for me, and I'm totally blown away by it!

happy,"A close encounter of the saintly kind…

…At the grocery store with my daughter. She’s little, so tends to have the “Please, buy me everything!” anytime we’re in the store. Most of the time she’s fine with a “Not today, sweetie.” but today, she was in her feels because ALLLLLLLL of the day-after Valentine’s Day items were smack dab in front of the door when we walked in. She wanted a balloon. Mommy said “Not today, sweetie.” and today, that “not today” didn’t go over very well. She proceeded to be very pouty. Meh, it happens. 

Well, we’re in an aisle looking for artichoke hearts and there stood a kindly, bespectacled, affable looking gentleman. I asked his pardon as we passed. We started making small talk after he tried to engage my daughter and she made it very clear that she wanted a balloon and wasn’t allowed to have one. He laughed and looked at me chuckling. “It doesn’t get easier as they get older!” to which I replied “She’s six… pray for me!” 

The kindly gentleman (before we learned his name) knelt down and said to my daughter “You know… balloons are wonderful, but they are often the best when they’re surprises, so maybe you can look forward to getting one when you least expect it.” This seemed to go over well with my daughter. 

The kindly gentleman (Mr. Myles, I came to know) and I continued chatting about kids, life, and random musings, eventually parting with a genuine sense of happiness over the entire interaction. He proceeded to the front of the store and my daughter and I continued our shopping. 

A few moments later, he found us at the back of the store with a heart shaped balloon. With the biggest smile ever, he handed it to my daughter and said “See? Isn’t it so much better when it’s a surprise?” I was dumbfounded, more tickled pink than I’d been in a while and said “You’re an absolute angel! No wait- a Saint! Thank you Saint Myles!” 

Random acts of kindness are the best. In a world full of curmudgeonly behavior- be like Myles."
happy,"I have sensory issues and I can't drive because I have epilepsy, so I was looking for a work from home job and I found a job for data entry. It's pretty easy so far according to the training assessments I was given and I start tomorrow. I'm so excited! It's been a few years since I've had a job. I have a 2mo old my husband makes good money but I am beyond excited! This is honestly such a blessing"
happy,"For 24 years I've worked to grow my business.  As a single parent it has been tough.  I missed many precious moments with my daughter and I've always regretted it.  My company has been my second greatest accomplishment next to my daughter.  I'm truly happy to sell it today because I'm selling it to the employees who have done so much to make it great.

I never thought this day would come and it's been an emotional rollercoaster for the last four years. I feared what retirement would mean.  I had an identity crisis coming to terms with not being the boss.  I feared boredom but the pandemic has taught me that I don't need my business.  Connection to my family and hobbies are more than enough to provide fulfillment.

I had a hard time with selling, I built this company and it's a reflection of me.  I've had plenty of offers from larger firms but I don't want to think what would have happened to my company, my employees and it's reputation if some huge conglomerate absorbed it.

It's taken years and I am not getting as much as I could if I sold to a competitor but I'm selling to people who I know will continue the company with the same standards I built it with.  I'm selling to the employees who are the ones that made it all possible. I also know I'm the only one who will be out of a job from this.

It took 4 years to let go and today I finally signed. In a few more months I'll walk away, happily. I have many years left to spend with my family, travel, enjoy my farm, and my horses. I'm truly thankful for the last 24 years and everyone who has made this moment possible.

Soory for my bad english because i am french..."
happy,"Stop living in your head and start living your truth. No one is worthy of judging you. We live on earth for such a short time. You want to spend it sad, stressed, and with anxiety? Fuck that!"
happy,"First of all, English isn't my first language so please understand. 

I come from a country and a community where dating culture isn't very big. Me and my brother have a 8 year age gap (he's younger). As a result, we don't relate to the same stuff, share similar likes/dislikes or even talk a lot about our personal lives or choices. Although I find a friend in him and he's been protective, caring; he barely talks about his friends, or problems, etc. 

But today! Oh boy, I'm still smiling ear to ear!
Today he called me out of the blue( lives in a different city) and asked me for an outfit suggestion because he was going to go meet this girl he has had a crush on. That alone, made me so happy! In that moment, I knew he found me helpful, I knew he trusted me with that as probably my parents would not approve of him skipping classes to go meet her, and I was happy that he came to me when he felt like he was stuck.
I gave him a suggestion, appropriate for a first date (of his life) and he left. I was fine, happy that he was happy. It was just a little meet at a cafe at evening, they decided to have some snacks, talk etc and head back their own ways.

Fast forward three hours, HE CALLED me.. n he told me how great the date was!! I NEVER expected he'd call and share that with me! N he was so giggly (I don't know if that's even a word, sorry) and chirpy and happy and nervous and so much more lol! He told me, that she looked so beautiful this evening, that he couldn't utter a word. So he scrolled through Instagram, luckily came across a picture of  beautifully arranged flowers and he sent that post to her with a message that said - ""you look this beautiful today"". My little brother, ladies and gentlemen!! He's 19. 19!!! We never have seen anyone go on a date except in movies and stuff ig. And this guy was like 5yo just a couple years ago 🥺🥺When did he grow up so fast! 

N to top all that, he thanked me - he THANKED ME for helping him know how to treat a girl right! He thinks I'm nice. He trusts me. He ACTUALLY looks up to me!!🥺
I. Am. Melting! 
I'm happy a ton! Sorry if this is too long. To the ones who stuck till the end, you people are my angels. I just wanted to share this. ❤️

happy,"ljust need to let this out to some one but I'm finally happy in a relationship, my last one was exhausting and it was to the point that my new S/0 was confused why was so happy when she came into the store with me. I also almost cried when the first time I was at work and she stayed at my place she had cleaned the entire place just cuz, no one has ever done that and it ment so much to me,It just feels like such a great weight off my shoulders and made me feel something I've never felt before. I can't wait to take her on her first vacay in Sept to show how much she means to me and to spend time with he in Disney. 

Also wanted to let people know that love is out there, if this woman can love a 23 year old autistic guy with 10k in Legos, then there is hope for everyone out there."

happy,"I work by myself in animal rescue in a place where abandoned animals is pretty common. After my money goes into them and my own groceries, I often have next to nothing to spend on myself. For the last year and a half, I was sleeping on an old donated sofa bed in the main room. But my birthday was last month, and some friends chipped in to buy me the mattress, bed frame, and even new pillows and bedsheets! I did end up building it myself, which took the whole month because I had to find time between running around doing animal stuff, so it feels like my accomplishment too. I just feel so proud of myself and so happy and lucky to have great friends.

happy,"ljust need to let this out to some one but I'm finally happy in a relationship, my last one was exhausting and it was to the point that my new S/0 was confused why was so happy when she came into the store with me. I also almost cried when the first time I was at work and she stayed at my place she had cleaned the entire place just cuz, no one has ever done that and it ment so much to me,It just feels like such a great weight off my shoulders and made me feel something I've never felt before. I can't wait to take her on her first vacay in Sept to show how much she means to me and to spend time with he in Disney. 

Also wanted to let people know that love is out there, if this woman can love a 23 year old autistic guy with 10k in Legos, then there is hope for everyone out there."
happy,"I’m so happy, I could cry "

happy,"Writing this while sitting beside my mom.😃

Just got home from a different city where i stay for studies but not very far. *When i live alone, i do the most idiotic things.* However, I slept happy and relieved yesterday thinking how i finally got time to get back home to my family. I woke up pretty late but was so happy and did all the chores then got ready. I feel at peace, no pain, no stress, no regrets, just pure serenity. I just needed to share it becos this is rare. I don't feel the best these days so i'm very grateful to be happy today all becos i'm home, sweet home, sweet parents. It felt really good to see my parents after a couple of months, i know it's not been long but it felt like forever. Saw my brother, his smile as bright as a sunny day. Before i return back to feeling shitty, I wanna thank universe for whatever i have today and for this life:)

Lastly, thank you sm for reading."
happy,"My parents and grandparents gave me a surprise party for my birthday (not too far from now) and almost all my friends were there, including one that is like an older sister to me. They got me the best gifts I could ever ask for. I'm over the  moon and so grateful for them, and, honestly, I forgot the party was technically about me because I was busy thinking about them and how happy they've made me.

So, although this comes from a total stranger, you always have somebody who will come through for you. And if you don't yet, you will. There's always somebody."
happy,"I’m traveling in Korea at the moment.  Japan last week.  Life is good despite all the info to the contrary.  Find time to enjoy and reflect on how far you’ve come.  We are living in the best of times, believe it or not.  Hugs to all. "
happy,"I'm celebrating today!
I found out a lot about myself during this year because of reddit and people here.

thank you all, folks!"
happy,"So I'm 16 and over 300lbs, and yesterday I made a post about me taking my first proper walk in over a year. Y'all made me feel so seen, I felt like I wasn't alone in this journey and I'm appreciative of all of you. I want to make an update everyday to hold myself accountable in a public space. I hope that my posts can inspire just 1 person to start doing the same. Cheers!"
happy,"I didn’t want cats. But these two little guys are here now and I’m so glad they are. 

My older one was a bony 6-month-old stray last winter that begged my mom for help, he demanded attention. He wanted love so much that the thought of sending him to a shelter where he’d be alone in a cage broke my heart, so I took him in. My younger one was a 1-2-month-old kitten who went on an adventure. She climbed into my roommate’s fiancée’s car while she was delivering food in a trailer park and wouldn’t leave. She took the kitten home, but her dog didn’t get along with it. Based on how she described the kitten, I again couldn’t send it to the shelter, so I took her in. 

Both live with me in my college apartment. It took some adjusting for them, but it was worth it. They’re best friends now, I love seeing them together. They play fight constantly, I can tell my older one is holding back and my younger one is learning how to catch him off guard. They love to eat at the same time as well. The older one always sleeps right by me and the younger tends to sleep on the ground or in the cat tree. When I wake up in the morning, they’ll both wake up too, and and younger one will always hop up on my bed purring and immediately go touch noses with my older one. 

We had to travel back home for Christmas, my older one has bad separation anxiety and he would’ve been alone for a couple days so I took both of them. They were stressed in their new environment. So when we went to bed, they cuddled with each other, paws on one another for comfort and support. 

I’m so glad I’ve been able to provide them a good home. Watching them grow up has been an honor. From putting their first collars on them to seeing my kitten see snow for the first time, there’s so much to smile about. They’ve got so much time to spend with each other, I’m looking forward to it. I’m glad I’ve not only been able to give them a home, but that I’ve given them siblings and best friends, another cat that they can trust and play with."
happy,"Throughout my life I have dealt with a series of health problems and that caused me to be very lethargic. Been to hospital and so on many times. Mainly stuff with my ovaries, kidneys, and liver.  

One thing that made me upset a bit was when I was 17 and attempted to donate blood, but was just not able to due to my condition and problems in general.

Today after dealing with going to the doctors pretty much once a month last year I was finally eligible to donate and so I signed up and did so. 

Happened only a few hours ago and I feel great! Before when I used to get blood drawn for example for medical reasons I would get very nauseous and faint just due to how my health was. Feels strange not feeling that way despite the donation being more blood."
happy,"These are the things I've quit to be more happy:

Competetive gaming: Its just a bunch of pixels on my screen that has no real value and it also made me lose the fun for videogames over the years. 

Social media: I still use social media but less than before. It took me a long time of self discipline to do that and nowadays I have a screen time of 20 min at best. I also think that social media helped me with that as well because whenever I read comments all I read are either bot comments, brainrot opinions or unnecessary hateful stuff. This also made me realize if the time I put into watching internet content is worth it or not. I have the mindset of using the Internet only for research purposes for things I dont know about so I can learn new stuff.

Bad eating behavior: I used to heavily rely on vitamin pills because I would always refuse to eat certain things because a doctor on YouTube would tell me this is bad or that is bad etc. It really ruined me as a person but today I'm doing a bit better now. I feel more happy now that my body is receiving the natural vitamins which was craving for years.

Being home all the time: I always saw my home as a ""safe"" place where I always wanted to stay all the time. 

Its quite dangerous over time and it does get to you mentally. I wasnt afraid of going outside and I dont have social anxiety but I always felt comfy being home and not doing stuff outside. Nowadays I always try to go outside whenever I can unless Im out of energy. I even bought a professional camera JUST so I can have a reason to go outside and do some nice pictures of nature or other things that look nice.

Quitting all of these things made me more of a happy person and I appreciate life more. Im almost 22 and honestly... maybe I should've listened to my mom but my teenage self had other things in mind. 

Have a nice day everyone :D"
happy,"It feels so euphorically good to be in love with my best friend. Have I laughed? Constantly, daily, hourly. Have I cried? Yes, tears of joy. We play video games, sometimes I watch him play, sometimes he watches me, but when we play together we always have each others backs! We go on long walks, at night, with our dog, to the beach, to different cities or exploring shops and attractions. We leave each other love notes, poetry, words of encouragement. We workout and hold each other accountable, cook meals together. We love each other’s families and feel comfortable and accepted. We have spa days together, face masks, bubble bath, scrubs, moisturizer and massages. When either of us feels sad we listen with true understanding and openness, thoughtful advice and write out plans to strengthen our resolve. We dance together, in our home, in the grocery store, with our dog or anywhere we feel like. I’ve never been so in love, at peace, accepted,  empowered and confident. I am finally happy. "
happy,"It's been impossible for me (66F) to find anybody locally who knows enough about this to treat me, and the Mayo Clinic turned me down as a patient because I don't have the worse, more dangerous level of the disease, just the basic really shitty form of it.

I recently found out about Ketamine being used to treat chronic pain✅ trauma✅ depression✅ anxiety✅ *and this mast cell disease*✅, and five days ago I started on a daily microdose protocol. (The Ketamine works on the trauma *and* makes mast cells **calm TF down**, which helps the depression, anxiety, and pain, which will help calm down my nervous system, which will improve the mast cell symptoms, which include all of the above except the trauma.)

I didn't know what to expect because the disease makes my body think I'm allergic to virtually everything, but I haven't reacted noticeably to the drug at all. I haven't been optimistic at all about my future since my diagnosis, I'm so excited!"
happy,"So, as the title says, I started driving today. It was a motorcycle, no less. For some context, I'm 26 and never been in the driver's seat.

I've had Daisy (name of my bike) about as long as I've had a motorcycle license - about a year - but I haven't been able to put her on the road for various reasons, the funniest of which being the government and insurance companies typically don't like it when your 500lb death rocket was purchased with a lawn mower battery installed.

That's not all of it. Daisy needed a lot of work. But she finally met all the requirements to be put on the road just this morning, and I rode all day today. Let me tell you, it was worth every drop of sweat, every frustrated cuss, and of course every penny.

I knew driving would be fun, but I never could've predicted the extent of such. I was so calm just driving around my neighborhood. Everything could go wrong, and I knew it. But I didn't care. If it happens, I'll handle it like I was taught. All I could feel was joy."
happy,"I (20f) grew up with an emotionally abusive mother who neglected me and favoured my two older half brothers. I grew up on tv because I was a socially awkward kid and any friends I did have would want to hang with my brothers instead (we have a 6 and 7 year age gap. So when I was 8 they were teens). I saw that on a lot of my favourite shows there would be at least one picnic episode where the family would go to a park with the classic red and white blanket and eat out of a basket. I always wanted that. I would ask my mom if we could do it with her, my brothers and me ( my parents divorced when I was three and my dad had custody on weekends) but my brothers just wanted to go to the skatepark with their junkie friends. My mom chose them over me every time. So when I was 14 I stopped asking cause I knew that the one day I wanted with my family didn’t matter as much as wasting hours watching my brothers do the same old tricks. 
Anyway I haven’t seen my mother since I was 15 when my dad got full custody of me after my mom disappeared with her boyfriend of the week for a couple days. I have a carer cause I was diagnosed with autism at 13. I asked if we could do a picnic one day with just us fully prepared to be rejected but she said yes. So tomorrow we’re buying a basket and food and sitting on a blanket in the park having a picnic. 

Also mom… Fuck you. "
happy,"This was filmed at their album release party this past January. I think it rocks and wanted to share. They’re on Spotify and are already ready for a second album this summer. Really happy for him, he’s the guitarist in the cowboy hat and wrote this instrumental!"
happy,"I think I may have perfected my winged liner on slightly hooded eyes! And I tried out a purple liner which makes my brown eyes pop, especially the hazel and green flecks. Just super excited about it and wanted to share!"
happy,"After dealing with both clogged ears since Oct 2022, multiple ER visits, walk-in clinics, doctors, mineral oils, hydrogen peroxide, failed referrals to ENTS, I finally found an ear doctor that was willing to help me. He was able to unclog both my ears!

I can finally hear again. 

Nature, music, sounds I never heard before are all overwhelming. It’s like having surround sound!

Grateful for the small things. I am happy not to ask people to repeat themselves anymore!"
happy,"A few days ago my co worker complimented me on my hair. She said that it's in perfect condition and that she loves it.
Yesterday I met up with my dearest friends, and my friend's girlfriend told me how she was chatting with her friend some time ago, and they both agreed on how I looked like I came straight out of a movie last time we met.
Ngl, lately I didn't feel good about my appearance, so this really lifted my spirit. I thought I was going to melt both of these times lol.
"
happy,"I think I’ve done really well. I’ve been with my beautiful wife for 30 years, my two children are loved, well adjusted, educated and emotionally whole. I am financially stable, in love, calm and have the family of my dreams. I have burnt a lot of bridges removing myself from narcissistic parents and siblings, doing everything I can to break the cycle of toxicity and destruction. Both my wife and I are true survivors and are each other’s best friends."

happy,"I learned a new word the other day and am practicing it now.

Hurkle-durkle originates from the Scottish language which means to lounge in bed longer than when you should have gotten up.

I think I can be an Olympic class or professional hurkle-durkler.  I've been practicing so long without knowing it that I'm actually a professional my first time trying!!!!   

May everyone have at least one hurkle-durkle day a week."
happy,"I applied at a movie theater the other day, and went there to interview earlier. I had a really cool conversation with one of the managers about working there. Sidebar but I love movies and always talk about them!! I left with confidence thinking I WILL get the job. Lo and behold about two hours after I left that manager called me back and offered me the job! I am so excited to finally work at a movie theater! Like I said I LOVE movies and talking about them so this is like the perfect job for me! I cannot wait to start working for them!"
happy,"Most of my life I've had little to no self esteem. I've always thought little of myself. Little to the point I settled for people, things and situations that I didn't deserve. For the last year I've been working on me. I started exercising and I've lost weight, I've grown in my faith, I've even started expanding my mind trying to learn new things, for example I've been studying German for a year for fun. Today I realized I'm not a bad guy and I have a lot of good to offer others and my self image has drastically improved. For the forst time I'm getting some self esteem and I'm starting to like myself which I never have. I just felt like sharing this."
happy,I think I'm off to good start today
happy,It was a cheap one but decided to try real Champaign to celebrate

happy,"I just got back from a trip to Idaho for my nieces high school graduation. I had casually kept a good relationship over text with my niece ever since she moved from Southern California to Texas to Idaho in less than a few months. I knew she was going through a lot emotionally and with college coming up it was stressful. I remember how I was at that age (I graduated 2003 and also switched high schools my sr year).

Come graduation day we're in the gymnasium and all the families are still kinda getting seated. I can see all the chairs for the seniors to sit on, I see all the administration on stage and the band in the back playing some songs. Then I see some of her family on her moms side get super excited and I look down to my right to see what the commotion's about. It's a sash that said ""Valedictorian"".

What?! Not only was my niece Valedictorian of her class, she absolutely CRUSHED it. She's already a full year ahead into her college coursework, passed every AP exam she took, played Bass Clarinet through school, did Softball and went to State Championships. She's like a superhuman.

I don't have any kids of my own, but the amount of pride I feel for her is immense. To top it all off she got a full ride to the University of Idaho and she plans on studying Neuroscience (you know, easy stuff). And she's still highly critical of herself and self analyses a ton looking for any way to be better in almost anything she does. The coolest thing I ever did was play video games professionally on a stage - this girl's about to solve complex brain problems as a hobby.

As a reward for all her hard work I made her a promise - a thing I never do because I hate making promises as I hate even the idea of not being able to keep one. I promised her if she graduated with a 4 year degree (not even necessarily in neuroscience, I gave her that leeway) that I'd personally pay for and accompany her on a trip to Japan. And since she's worked so hard in high school she's already got a year head start. I now have 3 years to save up for a Japan trip. Worst Best promise ever."
happy,"I've resisted unhealthy snacks today!

I've resisted, even though I've been tempted to have some because I'm quite hungry. I'm so happy, because I've gained almost 20kg due to my pregnancy and I desperately want to lose it so that I can feel good about myself again. 

Also, I plan on exercising today, even though it's hard to make time for myself. I've been so incredibly depressed after giving birth and, despite my hunger now, I'm not going to give in to having a snack because then I'm never going to make progress. 

I'm tired of disappointing myself and avoiding looking in the mirror. Today, skipping snacks and exercising is a small step in the right direction. I'm taking things one day at a time, one small step at a time. Please wish me luck! :)"
happy,"So I’m 17 and an engineering intern. I started last year mid-February and it’s been going pretty good. At Christmas, I got a $330 bonus ($200 after taxes) and I was super happy with that. Today, my boss stopped by my office and said they usually give out year end bonuses but their system wasn’t working right this year so it was a bit late. He said to remember that I’m only really part time and when I said I appreciate it no matter what he said “it’s better than a stick in the eye”. 

So after he said that, I thought it was gonna be like $100 max right, but I open it and see ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS!! It’s $640 after taxes and I know that isn’t a ton to some people BUT I AM SUPER HAPPY. And yesterday I found out I’m getting $1500 back in taxes so I am going to be absolutely ballin!!!! HELL YEAH!!!"
happy,"I’m kinda lonely in college I didn’t find many good friends here throughout the years, I got good friends back home though but kinda sad I can’t spend it with them bc I feel like 21 is kinda special? Maybe? But here’s to another trip around the sun of life 😄"
happy,"Hope my cat can brighten your day

My cat always brightens my day every day she brings a smile to my face , every day she brings a smile to my face

I hope this nice picture of her can also brighten your day. She is such a loving cat.

Hope you have all had a great day"
happy,Back from a deployment and finally got to take my mom out for a birthday celebration. Long overdue.
happy,I live in Florida so pretty soon it’ll be too hot to spend entire days out here so we enjoy it when we can!!
happy,"Today I (17 m) was home alone and started to take out the ingredients (pasta and frozen cubed chicken) but then I thought f*ck it, imma be brave today and boil frozen meat balls in tomato sauce instead of just heating up the chicken in the microwave. It went much better than the last times, I didn’t even think I  would start a fire, unlike the other times. I’m so proud of myself!"
happy,"I was accepted by my top choice college a couple of hours ago, and I'm really excited!! It's not selective whatsoever - the acceptance rate is around 85%, but I was still really nervous. My GPA isn't the greatest - only around 2.9 at the time of admission, because I had a rough sophomore year and was out of school due to an eating disorder and was in a treatment center hours from my home. I will never be able to fully explain to anyone how awful and scary that experience was for me. It's amazing because that really felt like the end of the world, and to see now that I have a lot more to do in my life feels super weird (but good!). I worked my ass off this past semester and scored a 28 on my ACT, and I can finally say I'm kind of proud of myself."
happy,"I just wanted to share to everyone that I am truly happy. The past couple of weeks, I have spent my afternoons and nights outside on my back porch just enjoying life. Sometimes I will watch my phone, or I’ll browse Reddit, but just being outside in the bliss, cool, and calming air just makes me feel some kind of way. Pair that with the beautiful sounds of the birds, and the frogs in the distance. It all just puts me at ease. Most of my life has been pretty stressful, especially now that I’m graduating high school in less than a month. To be able to enjoy the creations of God with the moon shining, the chirps of the birds in the trees, the speckled sky littered with stars, and the gentle sway of the pine trees… I’ve rambled. Point is guys, I truly feel happy. I have nothing to complain about. I have great friends, great parents, a cute little chihuahua, supporting teachers and staff at my school, and most importantly what seems to be a great future. No idea what I’ve done to deserve it all but I’m grateful. Just wanted to share my emotions because seeing life at face value, excluding all negatives, is so special to me. "

happy,I was super anxious about those tests because I was not doing well in the class and I thought I may fail few classes but im happy that I pass with A +.. this has been a crazy semester
happy,"My son loves to play outside. The house next to us is being rebuilt so it is unoccupied at the moment. There is a small pond located on the property so every now and then we venture over there to see what sort of wildlife we can spot. Yesterday, disappointment struck when we arrived to the pond and didn’t spot any animals. Normally there’s at least a few ducks, but not today. After about 10 minutes he looked down at the ground, picked up a very high-quality stick, and threw it into the water. The stick struck the water. The splash made him so happy he exclaimed, “I did it dada, I did it.” It took me a second but then I realized, wow he is so happy because of the stick hitting the water! Mind you, I have never thrown anything into this pond before, so this was just his primal instinct telling him “pick up stick, throw stick water, stick make splash, make boy happy”… anyways I thought I’d share this because it was enough to make a grown-man cry. Such simple acts can bring so much joy. We’re such simple creatures haha. Have a great day everyone

happy,"Recently, I went to the movie theater with my kid, and while we were waiting for the movie to start, we played duck-catching. We were both thrilled to catch two of them, and I was delighted to capture this moment. I sincerely felt that happiness can be found in the simplest of things and tastes even better when the joy is shared with a loved one."
happy,"What's so special about an office snack drawer?

It sounds funny but I have dreamed of having my own snack drawer at my own desk in my own office for as long as I can remember.  While I may not have my own office, I have a nice cubicle next to a large set of windows in the corner of the building.  It's wonderful!

I spent the better part of a decade getting an undergraduate engineering degree and graduated at 33 while working to support myself and doing extracurricular projects.  There were so many times I just wanted to quit.  I moved around a lot and changed majors at one point so it took a while to get through it all but I did it.  I now work for a company that I've always wanted to work for and I have myself a snack drawer.

It's silly but this snack drawer reminds me of all the blood, sweat, and tears that went into getting my degree and I just feel so accomplished when I turn around, open it, and grab some crackers.  I've come so far since I was waiting tables with no direction in life and it's a nice reminder that all the hard work paid off.  I can't help but smile when I think about it.  Lmao, sounds so weird typing it out but it makes me so happy!"
happy,"I've always had trouble finding jeans or any kind of pants for most my life. I was either way too skinny or, after I started body building, my thighs were too big. No matter what though, the waist band was always waaaay too loose. 

Today I tried curvy fit jeans, I wish I had tried years sooner. They look so good on me!!! They fit just right. I always have to settle for the loose waistband. Not today!

The only unlucky part is I'm back down to a 00 pant size... Very hard to find on sale racks or in stores."
happy,"I have the best in-laws, they spoil me more than their own son! I volunteer at a pig sanctuary, so when my MIL saw this she said she just had to get it for me. I’m so lucky 🥰"
happy,"So, this was my first year applying to physical therapy school and I managed to get accepted everywhere I applied. I even have a soft offer for a paid research assistant position for work similar to what I did in undergrad!

I understand that PT school isn't the best financial decision for most people, but I did accept my offer at a relatively cheap school. Beyond that, I grew up with a single mom and my first paycheck will be more than she has ever made! It just feels like all the work is paying off and I am making progress towards my goals."
happy,"I just started a new job 3 weeks ago. On the first day of training there were 2 other people in a group with me. We instantly clicked and have been having lunch together and texting each other everyday since. 

We each are going through breakups and while at different stages of healing, they are just so positive and supportive. It’s been really good for me. They are also both super healthy and workout regularly which is really impressive to me and has motivated me to get off my ass! lol  We even signed up for a hot yoga class this weekend! 🧘‍♀️

We were all texting last night saying how we felt we were supposed to meet one another. Just makes me feel grateful for being able to meet new friends at 43 and especially at a time when my heart is missing who I thought was my person so much. 
"
happy,"There used to be a falling down house across the street from me. Some realtor picked it up on a property tax sale and tore it down. Should have been no big deal and just a normal tear down and rebuild, right? Along the way, I noticed it was taking forever to build 2 homes they decided to build on the lot. It's been almost 2 years since construction started, 1 house is complete, the 2nd is about half finished. I'm home with a work injury, so there isn't much else to watch but this build and the boob tube. And of course, my dogs go berserk whenever people show up over there.

Dogs are going off one day and I look to see what set them off. It's a mold abatement company. I didn't really think too much of it, and a year passed before the house was complete. My friend tells me after she has signed the contract that she's moving across the street from me. That's when the alarm bells went off in my head. I let her know to be thorough in her inspection because they'd already treated this brand-new home for mold. Her jaw hits the floor, and she says that the owner/realtor (both are the same person) didn't disclose that.

There are other problems, like none of the dirt from digging in water lines, nor any gravel in preparation for driveways and sidewalks being compacted. None of the cement has rebar to reinforce and strengthen it to stand up to our winters. The un-compacted water line trenches run under both driveways. I guess hauling off piles of dirt wasn't a clue to the builder that it might be a problem later.

Final inspection day comes, and it takes 2 pry bars operated by 2 fairly large men to get the access to the crawl space open because it's so wet in the crawl space it has made the wood swell quite a bit. Not only is the crawlspace infested with mold, but against code, the crawl space wasn't built with any ventilation. So my friend got out of the contract, and the owner/realtor will likely lose her real estate license for not making proper disclosures.

Yes, it sucks that she has to look for another house, but she's so happy she didn't get stuck in a mold infested trap. And funnily enough, you can hear fans running from over there 24/7 in both houses."
happy,I wish I was this good at waiting 
happy,"Are they enough?

I moved away from family and friends to another state over 1000 miles away. It’s just my husband, two dogs and me. I work from home. I’m 52 years old and it’s hard to make friends at this age. Is it wrong that I feel content and dare I say happy with the limited companionship? Social media tells me I should have friends to hang out with on a weekly basis. 

I like hanging out at home with my pups and husband. I read and garden. We have fires and cocktails. 

Am I missing out? Should I be trying harder? I do go back “home” twice a year to see family and one or two friends."
happy,"I just got back from a trip to Idaho for my nieces high school graduation. I had casually kept a good relationship over text with my niece ever since she moved from Southern California to Texas to Idaho in less than a few months. I knew she was going through a lot emotionally and with college coming up it was stressful. I remember how I was at that age (I graduated 2003 and also switched high schools my sr year).

Come graduation day we're in the gymnasium and all the families are still kinda getting seated. I can see all the chairs for the seniors to sit on, I see all the administration on stage and the band in the back playing some songs. Then I see some of her family on her moms side get super excited and I look down to my right to see what the commotion's about. It's a sash that said ""Valedictorian"".

What?! Not only was my niece Valedictorian of her class, she absolutely CRUSHED it. She's already a full year ahead into her college coursework, passed every AP exam she took, played Bass Clarinet through school, did Softball and went to State Championships. She's like a superhuman.

I don't have any kids of my own, but the amount of pride I feel for her is immense. To top it all off she got a full ride to the University of Idaho and she plans on studying Neuroscience (you know, easy stuff). And she's still highly critical of herself and self analyses a ton looking for any way to be better in almost anything she does. The coolest thing I ever did was play video games professionally on a stage - this girl's about to solve complex brain problems as a hobby.

As a reward for all her hard work I made her a promise - a thing I never do because I hate making promises as I hate even the idea of not being able to keep one. I promised her if she graduated with a 4 year degree (not even necessarily in neuroscience, I gave her that leeway) that I'd personally pay for and accompany her on a trip to Japan. And since she's worked so hard in high school she's already got a year head start. I now have 3 years to save up for a Japan trip. Worst Best promise ever."
happy,"I got a new co-worker 6 month ago and I was her mentor and organized her onboarding. Today she said to me, that she hopes I will get promoted zo be the boss of our little Team (4 people) at the end of the year since she believe I would be great as a leader."
happy,"* hang out with people you love. go out, get drunk, have fun. everything in moderation hehe
* touch people. hugs, touches, pets, holding hands, squeezes, cuddles... EVERYTHING
* talk to people. open up. it's okay to allow yourself to be held by the people you want to be cared by. *it's okay to have the selfish desire to be burdensome*. it is OKAY! keep moving. never stay in one place too long (small and large scale). *comfort is the foil of growth.*
* exercise. even if you don't feel like going, just do 15 minutes. the rest will come. and I KNOW you always feel better after moving. whether it be a walk after dinner, a gym run, or even a a simple stretch outside. 
* always push yourself. no matter how hard it seems, you can always go further. one extra lap, minute, or rep... just that extra breath of effort will push you boundlessly. you will realize you can overcome the goals you set for yourself, which slowly seep into the rest of your life. 
* correct negative thoughts gently. when you feel hateful, reflect on your own thoughts. why are you being mean? your inner thoughts heavily influence your perspective on the outer world. humans are creatures of projection, so PLEASE be kind to yourself and others.
* eat breakfast. even if you don't think you want to. a coffee, a fruit, or a slice of bread. I promise that extra boost of energy is worth it. 
* talk to people that make you happy. keep the company of people who uplift you. keep those who support you, purge the ones who denounce you. *may the bridges you burn light the way!* 
* talk less, act more. for me, actions have always spoken louder than words. making less excuses and just doing things will help propel your plot. 
* MUSIC. listen to it, play it, learn it, make it, worship it. make playlists, sing songs, listen with people. it's the best thing to boost you up and feel understood when no one else understands. (the best part about music is there's so freaking much of it you can't possibly find something you don't like)
* question your perspective to the world. think of the external and internal causes that lead you to your beliefs. learn to question EVERYTHING, but keep a grounding foot on your intuition as well.
* don't overthink. if you're self conscious about it, they probably are too. no one is focusing on your faults. you are your biggest critic! 
* you get out what you put out and that's that!

***\* DISCLAIMER: \****

this is the unsolicited advice of a (highly opinionated) 22F yr old onliner, so take everything with a grain of salt. this just happens to be a helpful guide i keep in my notes app and wanted to share. 

on paper, i have no impressive concrete accomplishments in my life. i am a classic instance of a burnt-out-gifted-kid turned college drop out. so, if you would like to tell me i am living my life wrong, go ahead. 

i am quite content. 

i have spent a lot of  time trying to find that sense of normalcy we've all been aching for since graduating high school. it felt like i would never experience that grandiose feeling of truly ""living in the moment"" and ""seeing in color"" again.  i wished the world would pause for me just once. just to allow me to relive a core memory from my childhood again. but alas, that nostalgic relief never comes... 

because truly, life goes on, and it never stops. 

to some, it might sound harsh, but i interpret it as a comfort saying. accepting that ""it is what it is"" but ""what ***will*** be, is in my hands"", is the most important takeaway. 

ultimately, there is no ""cure"" or solution to find happiness. it comes and goes, wanes and rises, just as the moon and the sun! if you remember the world always has balance, whether it be spiritually, mentally, or physically, you begin to understand that 

spread kindness and patience, or don't. it is up to you do as you please! just remember to challenge yourself always, and truly focus with intention.

happy,"Most of my life I've had little to no self esteem. I've always thought little of myself. Little to the point I settled for people, things and situations that I didn't deserve. For the last year I've been working on me. I started exercising and I've lost weight, I've grown in my faith, I've even started expanding my mind trying to learn new things, for example I've been studying German for a year for fun. Today I realized I'm not a bad guy and I have a lot of good to offer others and my self image has drastically improved. For the forst time I'm getting some self esteem and I'm starting to like myself which I never have. I just felt like sharing this."

I am so unbelievably proud of my little girl. I'm smiling ear to ear thinking about how happy she must be to be living as her true self. She is my world, and her happiness is my happiness."

I met this girl two months ago online and I really adore how quickly and how mutually we have gotten close to one another, despite the fact that we started off as simply friends. It happened so naturally that it really felt magical in a way, none of it being forced, its like there was an unspoken agreement that we would be together lol.
She lives abroad, a timezone away, but I still cannot help but feel sure about here and I will get to pay her a visit really soon :).
And she really is the sweetest person I have ever met. She is respectful and caring to the point that it feels impossible for her to ever step beyond my boundaries, always being reassuring to even just remove possible wrong impressions of anything that might make me feel bad. We are capable of talking about any topic without disagreement and any worry without feeling unheard or judged. She started learning my entire language just for me (🥺) and she did not miss practicing it for a single day. I wish I could return the favor but I already know English lol. Shes really the best and she puts so much effort into being so that I dont think that will ever change. I hope I can be there for here whenever she needs it and I hope that she always feels how much I value her. I would take an oath to never stop taking her on dates if I could right now, regardless of what age we may reach together. And she looks so cute too like oml I physically melt when I see her smile, I really cant mess this up guys wish me luck lol."

I'm really excited to be able to go to college and be able to move out of my parent's house!! 
happy,"Hi everyone!

So my girlfriend and I (both women <3 if that's an issue for you, please just don't interact with this post) started dating at the end of January this year. This was after my ex-boyfriend and I broke up a few weeks before (we were together 4 years but it had been over a year that it wasn't working out. I don't want comments on this, you'll understand why later).

I have a lot of anxiety around relationships. My ex verbally abused me for the first part of our relationship, and then he was never physically there because he had to stay back home for understandable reasons. I was unhappy. I did things that hurt him too, and I've looked into why I did what I did and am learning to overcome what happened between us (the things he used to say to me in anger outbursts).

Now I've been friends with my girlfriend for 3 ish years now. I always thought she was so gorgeous and funny. I got to spending more time with her and next thing I knew, I was falling in love. I don't know what I did to get so lucky. Whenever I come forward about my feelings about something, she NEVER gets mad at me. She's so calm, so chill. She reassures me gently, and listens to me while explaining to me why this is okay, that I am valid. When I'm down for whatever reason, she makes me laugh without a problem. I can do anything with her and we can make it fun! I laugh harder with her than anyone else. She engages in things that I like and genuinely enjoys them, and vice versa.

The other day, we were snuggling and chatting in bed. I don't remember what she said, but it really hit home and I just felt my eyes start to water. She asked me what was wrong, and I just looked at her and said ""I just realized how unsafe I felt in the world before you"". She smiled and pulled me in, she let me cry on her for a few seconds.

She lets me talk about my ex and what happened. She knows I'm far from romantically or sexually interested in him anymore. She's so kind about the fact that I do miss him sometimes as a friend (I mean, 4 years with someone and talking almost every day is hard to let go of). I don't think about it often, really. She lets me talk about the things he did/said to me that hurt me deeply. I mean even yesterday we were talking about some of the horrible things he said and she looked at me and said ""I want to show you what a soft love looks like."" I just stared at her in awe and shock. I was frozen in place, just...speechless. She makes it safe for me to express excitement about things I love, she doesn't judge me for the things I enjoy, and SHE DOESN'T GET MAD AT ME!!! She doesn't insult me beyond what we both agree are jokes, she gently redirects me towards healthier behaviors for my mental health and for the relationship, we're both working together to be healthy and I just...wow....She's even coming home with me for Easter weekend (we don't celebrate but hey, why not).

I'm beyond happy with her. Maybe it's too soon to tell, I don't know, but I want to marry her someday. I really think this is it, that she's my future wife. She's currently asleep in my bed. I want her to be my love for the rest of our lives. She is truly and unequivocally the most beautiful person I've ever met (inside and out). I can't see a day where I don't find her funny anymore, where I don't find her attractive anymore, where I don't want to run to her to tell her about my day. I want to share my world with her. She's my best friend and more. I've never been happier, and I've never felt more like me.

If you read this whole thing, thank you so much :) I know it's a lot, it's messy, and honestly I can't even say everything I feel about this woman because I just don't have the words to express the deep, honest love I have for her. I wish you all the most WONDERFUL day!"
happy,"I just wanted to share it with somebody who can appreciate it. I am a young aspiring writer and I have never got actual recognition for it before. It's a small contest, but I am still incredibly overjoyed by it. It was a short story, but I mostly specialise in those anyway. It feels so awesome to have someone see my work and like it.
I'm not even excited about whatever my reward will be. I'm just happy someone read that little story and enjoyed it."
happy,"NSFW for mention of suicide 

This time last year I was lower than I've been. I remember having to pull my car over because I was crying so hard I couldn't see. I remember sitting with my loaded gun and the only thing that stopped me is kids often go to the park I was in. I remember trying to wreck into a semi after a particularly bad day. For years I was so depressed and so low I never imagined things could be this good. 

But now I wake up everyday overjoyed. I go to work and even though it's work I love it. I shower and I don't sit and cry. I ride with my windows down and sing along to my music and thank my God that I'm alive to see today. That I didn't opt out before I turned 18 like I thought I would. That I made it to 22 like I didn't believe I could. That I wake up today at 25 happier than I've ever been my entire life. I smile and I laugh and I love and I took control of what made my life so awful and kicked its ass until I had full control. 

I think back on all those years I spent unhappy and hating myself and harming myself and I wish I could talk to old me and tell her that it does get better. It takes a long time and alot of shit but you come out on top. 

25 is so young and my life is so full now and I just wanted someone to know. I'm just happy and that's all I've ever wanted and all I'll ever want. I'm just happy to be happy yall"
happy,Family dog didn't want to come inside from the snow. So I took a break from work and spent some quality time appreciating the outdoors. I'm glad I trusted his instinct.
happy,"We’ve had some pretty intense rain, heat and humidity over the past few weeks where I live, and it resulted in my garden going absolutely nuts with weeds. There wasn’t much I could do because it was either raining or so hot I would get heat stroke if I tried. So the last three days i spent a couple of hours each (still in the 30s Celsius) pulling the weeds. The first photo was taken after I had already pulled two garbage bags of weeds from the edge of the concreted space."

But being real, i have no idea what i want to do with my life, even tough i am now legally responsible for it.

Even tough im not sure if its the degree i will end up pursuing a career in, i feel like at lleast not stuck in place, nor moving backwards. at least the one or two, max three years that i would have ""wasted"" dropping out would let me be sure thay law school just wasant for me.

all in all, im pretty satisfied -when my parents arent breathing down my neck thinking i will just play games all year and not pass the year."

happy,"Workplace moment

I had a mentally bad morning after my birthday and was having a moment thinking about how certain people in my life would react if I wasn’t in this world (for context this doesn’t happen often and I am ok now).

When I came to work I turned the corner and my colleagues sang happy birthday and had a cake out for me. 

Fair to say my day went from 0-100 after that. It’s the little things that matters, even if you don’t ask if someone’s okay."
happy,"I have been struggling with IBS for over a year - the bloating, constipation, constant anxiety, experimenting with supplements; MSM, L- Glutamine, Vitamin C. I have also done the castor oil thing, but to no avail. 

However, last week I decided to finally go the antibiotics route and got flagyl. And surprisingly, it worked. I have had zero symptoms for the past 3 days. I am super happy."
happy,"recently, life has been busy so i've started to put my phone aside other than for an hour, and honestly it has made all the difference. there are so many unnecessary things we think about when scrolling endlessly on social media , highly recommend putting your phone in another room, so that you feel a weight lifted off your shoulders!"
happy,"We sat and talked for 6 hours yesterday and she said a lot of sweet things to me; like saying I was one of the best things to happen to her (I said that one first; she just said it back). I wish I wrote down the rest of them because I already forgot most of it (my memory is so bad and my life is so dramatically different than it was 3 months ago; new huge things are happening every week; last night I just got the keys to a house on the beach in Venice). There was one thing she said which did stick out, though:

""You're my type: extraordinary.""

No one has ever come close to making me that happy with less than 6 words.

Anyway, I'm about to make one of the biggest pivots of my life. I got an offer to leave the US and move to Switzerland\* and possibly Germany for a bit, so I'm working to change every last piece of me that has been holding me back. I don't know what I will resemble at the end of this, but I know, to at least one person, one of the most amazing people I've ever met, they found me extraordinary at one point in my life.

I honestly don't know that I could ask for a better compliment.

Anyway.

To future me, if you end up reading this, and you're feeling down, you were extraordinary to one of the most amazing people you ever met. That should not ever not matter to you.

\* it was somehow endearing how upset she got over this; I hate hurting her, even if it was inadvertent, but seeing her very upset texts burst through as I'm ""reviving"" my dead phone from an eventful night, was so \*damn\* heart-warming."
happy,"Today is the day my life will change FOREVER!!!!

Even as a welder, the most I have ever made doing back breaking work was $20.60 an hour. I currently make $18.22 an hour as a lead IT processing technician. Since 2021, I have been going to school for an A.A.S in multimedia/web development. I joined this company in 2022 and worked up to a lead IT processing technician. And today I was just offered a software developer job for $50,000 a year.

I wont lie, yes, I worked INCREDIBLY hard. I am in the honors society as the VP of communications and public relations for our school chapter. I have maintained a 4.0 GPA (I am graduating in May, I have 2 classes left that I am currently taking) and am so close to graduating with highest honors in my community college. I won an award last year in our state that only 55 students out of 200,000+ community college students called the All-State Academic Team and won a scholarship for Women in STEM. I am a very ambitious and have strived so much through this

BUT, I would have not had this job opportunity if I didn't have luck on my side. Working at this company, I found out they have a software developer team, and did my best to network with them and the adjacent IT team since I started. I had people who I made friends with who spoke my name when the software developer team asked about possible internal candidates. Just like it was luck for them that they actually had an internal employee who lives close enough to their facility who just happens to be going to school for web development, I just so happen to be lucky to work at a place where I could even move up like this.

There were 192 candidates, some of them being other internal employees. And I got it. me. I can't believe this.

happy,"Today I've been feeling stressed due to personal family issues, and I've been mentally ruminating on these issues for 1-2 hours. When I got to the gym (thankfully by myself) I was still ruminating. That changed when I got to my last exercise, sumo deadlifts (I like to save the best exercises for last). I hit a 5 RM sumo deadlift today, and my mood was uplifted. 

Now I'm happy AND proud I hit a milestone!! :)"
happy,"Ill try to be short and sweet, but basically I mentioned to my boyfriend, close friend of two years boyfriend for almost one year, that I'd really love a prom-posal for our senior year since I've never experienced one and it's a once in a lifetime kinda thing for us.

It was a while ago and I assumed her forgot because his schedule with school, sports, gym, etc has him running around. I wasn't even upset and chose to keep it to myself since I know his life is already hectic and didn't want to feel like I was pressuring him.

Well today we were in my room relaxing, I bought some small Lego sets to do, before we started building them he told me if I wanted to see a card trick he just learned.

He dabbles in card tricks and magic, when we first met he did a lot of magic for me, I love watching these tricks to this day. He sat me down next to him and started going on about Royal flush being the best hand in poker while doing the trick for me. I was confused but going along with it and before I knew it he said ""You know what else would be the best, you going to prom with me"" and in front of me the royal flush hand with heart cards with will you go to prom with me on the cards.

I'm heavily emotional and started bawling my eyes like a baby cause he caught me off guard and I didn't know what to say but he reminded me I had to say Yes while hugging me lol.

Regardless, I'm still tearing up over it still cause I can't believe how great of a guy he is and I adore every nerdy, geeky ounce of him.

I just wanted to share this because even though I know it's probably some silly high school romance I still feel like the luckiest person in the world.

Hope you're all having a good day or night and I wish the best for all of you who took time to read this sappy stuff :)"
happy,"I (30f) have been married to my wonderful husband for 4yrs and we dated for 2 before getting married. My in-laws have been wonderful to me the entire time. My FIL is like a second father and my MIL is like the mother I never had. Through the duration of my relationship with my husband, I have also been helping him heal his relationship with his parents, i.e making sure boundaries are maintained and communication lines remain open and honest whilst still being kind and considerate. 

My father suddenly passed away about a month ago and it's been really difficult as it was very unexpected but my husband, my friends and my inlaws have really rallied around and made sure I am okay. I've spoken to my husband and my inlaws and it has been decided that they will move in with us into my father's house to 1: help us with some bills and maintaining my father's property and 2: help them because they do not own the place they live now and will need some help as they are getting closer to retirement age. 

My FIL is disabled and on SSA benefits. I am also trying to get disability as I have not been able to work in almost 2 years due to a variety of health issues. My FIL has been so understanding and helpful with tips and tricks on how to do things around the house while chronically in pain or what processes are helpful in going through the disability thing. My MIL has been a real trooper through all of this and has helped keep me grounded as well. My husband is actually excited to live with his parents again because while I understand that his relationship with his parents is completely different than what I had with my dad, I don't want him to go through what I'm going through with any regrets and such. 

It just feels like a spotlight in a very dark time and I really love my husband and my in-laws. Even my brother in-law and future sister-in-law have been super amazing and accommodating and kind. I really love the family I married into and l hope they know I love them too."
happy,"I (25m) am in a relationship for the first time in my adult life and can not describe how happy I am.

Towards the end of October last year my boss told me that one of my co-workers (23f) who I did also consider a friend had told her she had a crush on me. I admitted that while I had never really considered it before, if she was interested I was willing to give it a go. We started flirting and a couple weeks later we had our first date. 

The funny part is that at the beginning of January my now girlfriend and I were talking and it came out that while we were definitely friends rather than just co-workers at the time, neither of us had considered a romantic relationship until our boss told us both that the other was interested and we realized that our boss had just been bored and decided to play matchmaker. We have since confronted our boss and thanked her for doing what she did.

We are both incredibly happy with our situation now and incredibly grateful to our bored meddling boss for setting us up (and creating two incredibly inefficient employees)."

I’m now home and I just really wanted to share what happened today, Sadly this was the first year I didn’t celebrate Easter with a Easter egg hunt but I still had just as much of a good time as the other past years :)

happy,"My two kids from a previous marriage now have mom, dad, AND papà. They looked so happy during our little ceremony; even my generally stone-faced teenager couldn't help but smile. Husband's parents served as our witnesses, and we had a lovely day together. We also have our honeymoon to Japan in a few weeks, which I'm beyond thrilled about. More than anything, I feel gratitude. For an amazing, intelligent, and funny partner, and for the wonderful and loving papà my kids have gained over the last few years. My life has gone from the very dark place I was born into to this...it feels like a fairytale. I have my partner, my babies (shared time with their dad, but for several months at a time which is great for us with school,) and then university finally, and just generally life is stable and good. I didn't know where else to share but I'm just really happy. :)

I looked at the photography and it's absolutely beautiful and he took in one of my favorite vacation spots. tawas Michigan. So double meaningful. I'm very happy to have this in my home.

happy,"I worked all year while doing school (the maximum amount of hours I was allowed to do I did), I worked during all my breaks and I haven't gone on any trips out of state because I wanted to feel financially sane more than wanting to go out. I've been living bill to bill, rent to rent, month to month and sometimes had to borrow to meet the rent (since my pay is bi weekly).

I've been so bitter all year. Initially it hurt that I had to work and do my difficult stem course and worry about feeding myself while all my friends and classmates lived in their lavish apartments close to school as I commuted from far away to save money. But I don't feel bitter anymore!


I know what living month to month feels like so I'm gonna still do max hours of work. But I'm gonna be able to give myself 2 weeks of breaks between semesters now. 


I'm moving in with my boyfriend too which will reduce my rent by so much since we're splitting.

happy,This is my cat Hopper. He’s a pretty rad and chill cat and really just likes to hang out with his people. The lil dude doesn’t know it but he makes me very happy and life would be boring without him. 
happy,"Dropped out of college in 2013, became a licensed cosmetologist in my state… worked hair full time for 9 years. Went back to school. 

Graduated, passed exams. I am a certified nurse aide. "
happy,I live in Florida so pretty soon it’ll be too hot to spend entire days out here so we enjoy it when we can!!
happy,"First of all, English isn't my first language so please understand. 

I come from a country and a community where dating culture isn't very big. Me and my brother have a 8 year age gap (he's younger). As a result, we don't relate to the same stuff, share similar likes/dislikes or even talk a lot about our personal lives or choices. Although I find a friend in him and he's been protective, caring; he barely talks about his friends, or problems, etc. 

But today! Oh boy, I'm still smiling ear to ear!
Today he called me out of the blue( lives in a different city) and asked me for an outfit suggestion because he was going to go meet this girl he has had a crush on. That alone, made me so happy! In that moment, I knew he found me helpful, I knew he trusted me with that as probably my parents would not approve of him skipping classes to go meet her, and I was happy that he came to me when he felt like he was stuck.
I gave him a suggestion, appropriate for a first date (of his life) and he left. I was fine, happy that he was happy. It was just a little meet at a cafe at evening, they decided to have some snacks, talk etc and head back their own ways.

Fast forward three hours, HE CALLED me.. n he told me how great the date was!! I NEVER expected he'd call and share that with me! N he was so giggly (I don't know if that's even a word, sorry) and chirpy and happy and nervous and so much more lol! He told me, that she looked so beautiful this evening, that he couldn't utter a word. So he scrolled through Instagram, luckily came across a picture of  beautifully arranged flowers and he sent that post to her with a message that said - ""you look this beautiful today"". My little brother, ladies and gentlemen!! He's 19. 19!!! We never have seen anyone go on a date except in movies and stuff ig. And this guy was like 5yo just a couple years ago 🥺🥺When did he grow up so fast! 

N to top all that, he thanked me - he THANKED ME for helping him know how to treat a girl right! He thinks I'm nice. He trusts me. He ACTUALLY looks up to me!!🥺
I. Am. Melting! 
I'm happy a ton! Sorry if this is too long. To the ones who stuck till the end, you people are my angels. I just wanted to share this. ❤️

happy,"It's been some time since we have time to go out on our own, she realized that the zoo give her a free ticket fkr her b-day, so we said ""why not?"""
happy,We’ve been dating for a year and about five months? They picked me up from my apartment and we went to a really nice restaurant. I was panicking so much.
happy,"For 24 years I've worked to grow my business.  As a single parent it has been tough.  I missed many precious moments with my daughter and I've always regretted it.  My company has been my second greatest accomplishment next to my daughter.  I'm truly happy to sell it today because I'm selling it to the employees who have done so much to make it great.

I never thought this day would come and it's been an emotional rollercoaster for the last four years. I feared what retirement would mean.  I had an identity crisis coming to terms with not being the boss.  I feared boredom but the pandemic has taught me that I don't need my business.  Connection to my family and hobbies are more than enough to provide fulfillment.

I had a hard time with selling, I built this company and it's a reflection of me.  I've had plenty of offers from larger firms but I don't want to think what would have happened to my company, my employees and it's reputation if some huge conglomerate absorbed it.

It's taken years and I am not getting as much as I could if I sold to a competitor but I'm selling to people who I know will continue the company with the same standards I built it with.  I'm selling to the employees who are the ones that made it all possible. I also know I'm the only one who will be out of a job from this.

It took 4 years to let go and today I finally signed. In a few more months I'll walk away, happily. I have many years left to spend with my family, travel, enjoy my farm, and my horses. I'm truly thankful for the last 24 years and everyone who has made this moment possible.
"
happy,"I've been pretty depressed for several month and I just started to get better. I've develloped a crush on a old schoolmate that is really beautiful and out of my league, but I'm not pessimistic of my chances.

We talk a little bit on instagram. Nothing more nothing less. It is nice even tho nothing is really happening.
I didn't saw her in real life for like 3 years. Only on social medias

This morning I took the Subway to go to work and I saw her in the train. God she was beautiful !
She left after just 4 stations but that was such a cool moment for me.
Nothing happened, but just the fact that I got the opportunity to see her in real life made that day a bit better :)"
happy,"
So I’ve officially made it a month away from drinking and about 2 months away from morphine. And considering all the shit I’ve been through recently and the fact I was drinking a handle of vodka every school week and every weekend for over a year I am incredibly proud of myself for not relapsing. I went from chugging my last drink in last then 30 seconds to only smoking an 8th in like a week. I’m also kinda happy cuz I just turned 16 and now I don’t have to worry about me being stupid and trying to drink and drive. Honestly all of this only happened because my girl didn’t like me when I was  drunk. and considering I’m not the only one in my family who has had a drinking problem and I’ve seen how alcohol ruined my grandparents marriage and eventually led to my grandfathers death at 45 I honestly feel kinda strong for once."
happy,"

My professor had embarrassed me in front of the whole class because I did not know one answer. He started asking me my name and throwing comments about how I don't know anything and all. He made me stand in front of everyone. Nevertheless, I, someone who's suffering from anxiety disorder and severe anxiety, someone who gets embarrassed so very easily, for the first time, did not get embarrassed. 

I was pretty chill tbh. I did not have a raised heartbeat, I did not feel extremely sad, I did not panic, I might have had a few tics but that's it. After he left, I just went about doing my job and honestly I was impressed with myself. Idk whether this happended because I have a bigger embarrassing situation/trauma to deal with such that this felt so small or because I was already tired of everyone's sh!t. 

It happened and I'm honestly kinda happy."
happy,"I’m a 20 year old in my last year of college and for a long time I was so confused as to what I wanted to do with my communications degree. I did a few internships which I hated and had no idea how I was going to cope working in a place I hate for the next 50 years. 

Now, by a chance opportunity, I started a new job alongside my studies for a company in an industry that I love to death (it’s a type of sports). 

I love the people I work with, my office is super nice, and the work is really interesting and fulfilling. I’m actually genuinely excited to grow and learn and forge my career and I am so grateful for the opportunity!

happy,"I am not a phone addict, but I always used to grab my phone and start doom-scrolling whenever I felt bored, which increased my screen time to somewhere around 5 hours.

I decided to give it a shot in the hopes that it might at least aid me, and I am pleased to report that it worked. I won't claim I fully quit using my phone in a few days, but it did help me minimize my screen usage by about 65%.  "

I know there have been some really cool sets to come out in the past couple of years (some look like flowers or little zen gardens or insects one might pin, etc) so when he got himself a set today I also looked. I found this darling little bonsai tree and he offered to get it for me so we could build together! 

We both put ours together tonight and it was so much fun! I didn't realize that the cherry blossoms were actually little pink frogs until I got to that section. My little bonsai is chilling with its adorable little pink frogs on my counter and I could not be more pleased!

And for anyone wondering, hubby got himself the Thanos glove and he is pleased as punch! 😊"
happy,"Workplace moment

I had a mentally bad morning after my birthday and was having a moment thinking about how certain people in my life would react if I wasn’t in this world (for context this doesn’t happen often and I am ok now).

When I came to work I turned the corner and my colleagues sang happy birthday and had a cake out for me. 

Fair to say my day went from 0-100 after that. It’s the little things that matters, even if you don’t ask if someone’s okay."
happy,"I think I’ve done really well. I’ve been with my beautiful wife for 30 years, my two children are loved, well adjusted, educated and emotionally whole. I am financially stable, in love, calm and have the family of my dreams. I have burnt a lot of bridges removing myself from narcissistic parents and siblings, doing everything I can to break the cycle of toxicity and destruction. Both my wife and I are true survivors and are each other’s best friends."

happy,"It feels so euphorically good to be in love with my best friend. Have I laughed? Constantly, daily, hourly. Have I cried? Yes, tears of joy. We play video games, sometimes I watch him play, sometimes he watches me, but when we play together we always have each others backs! We go on long walks, at night, with our dog, to the beach, to different cities or exploring shops and attractions. We leave each other love notes, poetry, words of encouragement. We workout and hold each other accountable, cook meals together. We love each other’s families and feel comfortable and accepted. We have spa days together, face masks, bubble bath, scrubs, moisturizer and massages. When either of us feels sad we listen with true understanding and openness, thoughtful advice and write out plans to strengthen our resolve. We dance together, in our home, in the grocery store, with our dog or anywhere we feel like. I’ve never been so in love, at peace, accepted,  empowered and confident. I am finally happy. "
happy,"I just got back from a trip to Idaho for my nieces high school graduation. I had casually kept a good relationship over text with my niece ever since she moved from Southern California to Texas to Idaho in less than a few months. I knew she was going through a lot emotionally and with college coming up it was stressful. I remember how I was at that age (I graduated 2003 and also switched high schools my sr year).

Come graduation day we're in the gymnasium and all the families are still kinda getting seated. I can see all the chairs for the seniors to sit on, I see all the administration on stage and the band in the back playing some songs. Then I see some of her family on her moms side get super excited and I look down to my right to see what the commotion's about. It's a sash that said ""Valedictorian"".

What?! Not only was my niece Valedictorian of her class, she absolutely CRUSHED it. She's already a full year ahead into her college coursework, passed every AP exam she took, played Bass Clarinet through school, did Softball and went to State Championships. She's like a superhuman.

I don't have any kids of my own, but the amount of pride I feel for her is immense. To top it all off she got a full ride to the University of Idaho and she plans on studying Neuroscience (you know, easy stuff). And she's still highly critical of herself and self analyses a ton looking for any way to be better in almost anything she does. The coolest thing I ever did was play video games professionally on a stage - this girl's about to solve complex brain problems as a hobby.

As a reward for all her hard work I made her a promise - a thing I never do because I hate making promises as I hate even the idea of not being able to keep one. I promised her if she graduated with a 4 year degree (not even necessarily in neuroscience, I gave her that leeway) that I'd personally pay for and accompany her on a trip to Japan. And since she's worked so hard in high school she's already got a year head start. I now have 3 years to save up for a Japan trip. Worst Best promise ever."
happy,I hope it does the same for you!
happy,"What's so special about an office snack drawer?

It sounds funny but I have dreamed of having my own snack drawer at my own desk in my own office for as long as I can remember.  While I may not have my own office, I have a nice cubicle next to a large set of windows in the corner of the building.  It's wonderful!

I spent the better part of a decade getting an undergraduate engineering degree and graduated at 33 while working to support myself and doing extracurricular projects.  There were so many times I just wanted to quit.  I moved around a lot and changed majors at one point so it took a while to get through it all but I did it.  I now work for a company that I've always wanted to work for and I have myself a snack drawer.

It's silly but this snack drawer reminds me of all the blood, sweat, and tears that went into getting my degree and I just feel so accomplished when I turn around, open it, and grab some crackers.  I've come so far since I was waiting tables with no direction in life and it's a nice reminder that all the hard work paid off.  I can't help but smile when I think about it.  Lmao, sounds so weird typing it out but it makes me so happy!"
happy,"Just needed to get off my chest how happy I’m feeling rn in my relationship. We’re definitely not perfect but my fiancé tries really hard to make me happy and really listens and takes on board anything I have to say. It helps that he’s a complete lefty and the biggest feminist I know, we share all the same values and have the same morals. We’ve been together 3 and a half years now, I have a child with my ex husband and a child with my fiancé. He treats both kids and loves both kids the same, he’s a brilliant dad and I feel so lucky. 

My heart feels happy ♥️"
happy,He’s so cute!!! I love him cause we both love dumplings and we’re both fun dumplings cause I think that’s way cute to say plus I got lots of candy it’s so much I love it! I usually have trouble deciding candy so I got Tootsie Rolls (my favorite) and a lot of the cute ones like gummy bears and gummy hearts and roses plus some gummy diamonds they’re blue and everything!!!! And that one that’s pastel blue and pink is called a Unicorn Gummy I think and I love love love LOVE unicorns🤞🏼😋!!! His shirt says “Hugs” and I got a cute bag that has him in and I got a picture with the giant giant bear inside I would’ve gotten an outside picture of the store but there were people there and I didn’t wanna stop on the middle of the walkway🙁 and the woman doing the bear fluffy stuffing was going to have me step on the button and I couldn’t (I have anxiety and got nervous😾) apparently a lot o people think they’re too old for this stuff?????? That’s crazy to me cause I never really thought like that cause I love Build-a-Bear and NEED the new Sesame Street ones !
happy,"and also wanted to ask the you, the users of internet if I am the only one who thinks that she looks like soe kind of a fairy."
happy,"They’re both just one year old and my first two puppies.  

I’ve been in a totally dark place for the last two months from losing my girl, my bestfriend, but I’m so thankful that my other dog has saved me. Although I’d forever miss and think about my girl, I will look at this birthday as a start of a new life for me and this wonderful boy. That there is hope for me. 

Happy New Year everyone!"
happy,"I know this sounds silly. 

But my friend is going through a bad divorce. He's been abused for 30 years by a wack job. He got kicked out of his place, and I offered my couch. 

We're sitting on my bed, watching a movie, and high. He has had a terrible day, so I'm trying to make it better. I noticed he took a picture of a gift I got him and posted it to a Reddit sub. 

I asked what he was doing, and he got so excited. He told me he was in this nice sub and everyone is so welcoming, that his post got 700 karma. He is very, very new to this app and is older, so he's not up to snuff with everything. 

But he just lit up when he showed me how excited he was that people were talking to him and that they liked his post so much that he got ""a little karma"" 

This man has cried his eyes out for hours tonight; seeing him beam about something so small just filled my heart. I'm overjoyed to see him this excited! 

Anyway, I just, really want this man to be happy, so for this small thing to really bring him joy just makes my chest burn.

Edit: 

If you all want to give him some love I'll link his art post. It'll make him very excited that people enjoy his art. He only ever shares it within his work space. Not sure why but I think it'll get him excited.

happy,So I wanted to share that something rly good happened to me in my career/job today and I usually share these things with my gf of 5 years but we recently broke up and I have no one to share the happiness im feeling right now so I thought I'd just post it here :) 
happy,"The day me and this cutie met irl, we were supposed to go on our first date. Instead, I totalled my car 2 hours from home and 2 hours away from him (I'm ok!). He drove all the way to get me from the tow shop, drove to my hotel and stayed with me so I wouldn't be suffering alone because lawd I was some pain from being jarred so hard! Despite the dramatic start, our second date weekend was amazing! We went to a festival, watched Tenacious D's Pick of Destiny, I introduced him to Puerto Rican food and culture, and best of all, he met my grandma and she loves him! I am so happy, sooooo happy! I feel so lucky. :)"
happy,"I'm a few states away from home for a conference this week, and during some downtime I looked up things to do nearby. Turns out the art museum a short walk away had my FAVORITE sculpture on display, I didn't even know it had been put into a collection! 

L' Amante by Beth Cavener is every bit as beautiful in real life as I could have imagined and I am SO excited to have been able to marvel at it with my own two eyes!"
happy,"Like the title, I’ve moved far away from home and I had never done this before. I always lived in the place where I was born. I honestly never even thought I would move. Last year, I was promoted to manager for a company and I had a LOT of work to do. I needed help, but then lost some accounts and didn’t need as much help anymore. Someone told me early last year that they should’ve taken the opportunity to move back home when they had the chance (to my hometown - he was helping me for a while, and he lived 400+ miles away.)

It was a seed in the back of my mind to POSSIBLY eventually move. His best friend moved to my hometown to help me full time. Meanwhile, I grew feelings for a friend who said he was moving to where this guy lives. I still thought about moving, but thought there’s no way I would move for a guy just because I like him. (We aren’t in a relationship, but I am crazy about him. lol) 

Well, as luck (or fate?) would have it, I lost even more business at work through no fault of my own. I was desperate for a change because I needed to make more money. I don’t have a roommate and I have bills I need to be able to pay. No other job applications were going anywhere. My friend that I mentioned above suggested that I move out of my hometown, and I thought it might actually not be a bad idea to have more work in a bigger city, like he said. I thought really intensely about it and talked about it with my closest friends and family. 

Even the guy who worked for me was afraid of losing his job. I told him not to worry because I was thinking of moving to take his best friend’s place - he was in a hard spot financially too, and would have help in my hometown to get back on his feet. Every single person I told about the possibility of me moving said to 100% do it. (Well, aside from my parents, but they have been supportive even when I told them my crush moved away. I thought they were the crazy ones for that. LOL)

I got home from vacation after thinking long and hard about moving, and I drafted the email to send to my boss about moving to two possible locations. One because I had family there, and the other because I KNEW the other guy wanted to move earlier in the year back to my hometown. I had just spent my vacation near where he was living, and I liked it - but I was NOT thinking of moving when I took that trip. Lo and behold, when I got back home, I nearly went negative in my bank account. I had to return socks and underwear because I just couldn’t afford it. My car payment was coming up and I was so scared. 

I thought about if I were to move, what amount of money would I need to do it? The number $5k popped up and I figured that would be just enough to move. I had no idea how I would get the money. As if by magic, within 3 days, I never went negative in the bank and I had $5k to my name in addition to everything I needed for bills that month. My boss was totally willing to facilitate the move and the guy was desperate to move back home, even though he didn’t WANT to leave. He HAD to leave. 

It’s just been amazing how smoothly this has all worked out. I was terrified of moving here because I don’t know anyone very well, but I do have some friends in the surrounding areas whom I hope to get to know better. The cherry on top is that the friend I have feelings for lives here too, but I am not going to push anything with him. I didn’t move here FOR him, but it’s definitely a big perk, in my opinion. I don’t even know if he likes me at all. But it’s just so weird how everything has panned out. I am not complaining though. I absolutely adore this place already. 

All my life I thought I would hate it up here. I can’t think of a single negative other than my small family and my closest friends aren’t here. However, since moving, I am actually talking to my friends and family MORE than before! They care about my whereabouts and how I am doing so they are checking on me more often and making more of an effort, which is really nice. 

I am just so elated to be here in my quiet little bubble - in a beautiful city, which so far hasn’t given me anxiety much at all, despite it being so much bigger than where I am from. Everyone has been so incredibly friendly and, again, everything has been so smooth. It feels like it was meant to be. My mind is blown by this experience and honestly, it’s only been 48 hours, but I don’t think I’ll ever move back home unless I absolutely have to, and even then, I am sure it would be temporary."
happy,"A while ago I wanted to download a game from my childhood because I remember really liking the music. I'm waaay too old for anything in it of course and don't have kids but I wrote a review baisicly saying that it made my childhood and that even though I've grown out of it I still adore it. I checked today and found out that the creator of the game wrote back a review saying ""We were so pleased! We are extremely glad that we brought happiness to your childhood! This is our goal! Thank you very much for these words on behalf of the whole team! Be healthy!"" (Translated from bulgarian). Actually crying tears of joy this was so sweet."

happy,This works good if I'm sad about stuff that isn't a huge deal which is a lot of the time haha
happy,"awww, thank you to whoever gave me gold! 


I'm trying to respond to everyone because I love you all for taking the time to comment."
happy,"After 3-4 years of increasing exercise intolerance, I was diagnosed with a heart problem (SVT) 3 months ago. I'm only 40. At the time I could barely walk for 5 minutes. After medication I was up to 15 minutes walking in December. On Saturday, I completed a 2 mile walk outside (normally a big migraine trigger)! I haven't felt this good in 18 years! And the walk was for migraine awareness and education, so I learned about advocacy programs! This is a huge accomplishment for me and I am so incredibly happy. I'm actually tearing up just thinking about it! Now I can work on weight loss and socialize more, it's been absolutely life-changing."
happy,"I was a mess for two decades, booze, coke, just whatever. I have now made it two years without a drink or any coke. I'm so happy right now. I was able to go back to school and I went from a 36 waist to a 30. I later gave up sodas and energy drinks, but alcohol was the tough one. Two years!!!"
happy,"I was scrolling through Reddit and came across a video of this tiny dog carrying an abnormally large stick, maybe even a branch in his mouth, waddling around with it as he tried to balance himself, it was absolutely adorable! I love dogs, man <3"
happy,"I'm 28 years old. I graduated high school early and expectations were high for me even though I lived in a toxic sometimes abusive household. I worked in a restaurant to claw myself out of the gutter, and ended up with pretty severe addiction problems. Over 2 years ago I decided I wanted to break the cycle of mental illness and addiction in my family. I wanted to work on my mental health, but I knew that meant recovery. I went to treatment, found a form of therapy that worked for me and after 2 years of individual with a year of group therapy in there I have evolved! Not only did I get a day job that I love and feel valued at, but I also began school in January! My first term just ended, and I got A's in my two classes! And I got 100% in my favorite class of all time!! A good friend of mine went to some nice schools in the area but he's been beyond supportive throughout my journey so I texted him about school and that was his response. I'm so blessed. Good friends, just got a raise and more hours at my day job, we have partial custody over my step son, and I'm doing great mentally and emotionally on top of it all! IF I CAN DO IT YOU CAN DO IT TOO! LOVE YOU ALL TGIF I GET TO SAY THAT NOW AFTER QUITTING THE RESTAURANT LIFE IT KEEPS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER YALL XOXOXOXOXOX"
happy,"Today marks 1 year of not experiencing a panic attack. 🥹 Mine were severe - included vomiting, heart irregularities, tremors, sweating, a fleeting feeling, and occasionally paralysis. I felt as though I would never be free of these, until I moved and surrounded myself with lovely, caring individuals. I have not had one since and I want to jump around in happiness. My mental health was declining a few years back and now I feel like it might be at its positive peak which I’m eternally grateful for. This past week especially I’ve felt an overwhelming sense of peace. Just wanted to post in case anyone else is suffering, I still get anxiety but from all the work ive done and being in the right place has helped so much and the anxiety is very minor. 🙌🏼💕"
happy,"Recently I suffered an accident at a grappling competition. Large fracture on my right leg and 2 smaller ones near the ankle. 

&#x200B;

You would think this is a extremely low point in my life to get such a crippling injury, well you would be quite wrong. Part of is perhaps that in the end I will make a full recovery after a few months so I would be left in the end with just the humbling experience and the attitude that people now have with me.

&#x200B;

I used to think my friends are only friends with me because I am to use of them and because we have similar hobbies where we train together. Used to think I was the after thought of my family as the middle child. My feelings were always less important than my sisters, I was always supposed to support them if something happened but it never felt like it was given back.

&#x200B;

Well not only has my family offered help to even moving in with me to help me out and interrupting their lives to do so, not only have my friends all offered to drive me to the hospital and come to my place to play board games and entertain me, and even offering to do my university work but even random strangers on the street stopping their cars and asking me where am I headed and to drive me home. Old women offering to carry my bag and even the meanest looking face tattoo dudes offering help without even being asked or remotely needed.

&#x200B;

I am a 23 year old dude, used to feel alone in the world where nobody would care if something happened to me to now feel like society actually cares. Ofcourse Ive had a negative experience too but positive experience outweighs easily the one bad experience. To the people that are like the ones that help, thank you, you have no idea how much you help. I certainly would strive to become more like the selfless people that helped me when I fully recover. And dont judge the mean looking people by appearance, maybe thats how people also viewed me before, they turn out to be the most sympathetic of them all."
happy,"At 9:56 am today my boyfriend (m23) of 4 years and I (f21) both randomly  texted each other ""I love you ❤️"" while we were apart and it just made me smile. I was in my social work course watching a mock therapy group and one of the girls said her partner is her comfort person and I thought of him because he's mine. He told me that ""dreams"" by the cranberries was playing at his work (🥺) and it reminded him of me (omfg I'm winning). Life is funny and this just really reminded me that there are people who love you and think about you even when you're not around. "
happy,"First time in almost 7 years that I had a date in a arcade, then we went for some Asian street food (kinda expensive on my country but soooo great) 

I'm really hoping the rest of the year will be even better"
happy,i look good and i feel good - hiking five miles every morning has been glorious and the views here are chefs kiss! just wanted to share that little slice of sunshine. :)
happy,"My bucket list is filled with things like running with the bulls, paragliding from the summit of Mt. Blanc and climbing Mach Piccu, many things I won’t likely get around to, leaving my bucket unsatisfyingly shallow. 
My anti-bucket list has simpler and more achievable goals like removing unhealthy eating habits, avoiding overcommitting myself and purging toxic people and negative influences.
This bucket is filling up much faster and I’m finding longer term happiness rather than short term excitement. "
happy,"Life update: you may remember me from this post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/b5p72v/comment/ejhehp6/](https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/b5p72v/comment/ejhehp6/)

But so many things have happened since then. You guys truly changed my life at that moment and I wouldn't have even gotten started without you guys. I've been picked up by a small but pretty successful publisher, DYB Publishing, for both my seven book fantasy series and science fiction trilogy.  I also went to my first anime convention last week and almost sold out (despite me almost dying from social anxiety). And I just wanted to come by and thank all of you! Also here are some pictures! 

(Actually it was five years ago on the original post. Time is nebulous).

happy,"I posted something in this sub a little less than 6 months ago after being clean for 2 weeks (I deleted the post for unrelated reasons) and while I got a lot of support I also got a lot of crap because it was ""only two weeks, come back when you have actually achieved something"".  Well, [here I am](http://imgur.com/gallery/ZDd7cMS), 6 months later, still clean, recently engaged, just got into a computer programming program, and have never been happier.  I just resolved my legal issues last week, actually have a savings of more than $2K, am rebuilding relationships with my family members and have nothing but optimism and hope for the future I never bothered to think about before.

Just wanted to use today to send out a PSA to anyone struggling with addiction - it can and DOES get better.  I am here for anyone that needs support. 

♥️

Edit:  I honestly hate these types of edits but holy shit I worked a double yesterday and just woke up to this... You guys are amazing.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart. "
happy,"Tomorrow is my 18th birthday. I don't have friends, I don't have a high school diploma, I'm fighting/no contact with almost my entire family, and I work a low paying job. But I'm alive, I have a roof, usually have food. There are a lot of people that can't say the same. I've been severely depressed since I was young, a lot of people told me to ""die"", or that ""I definitely wouldn't make it to adulthood"" (guess what, bitches). Eighteen years old is like a baby that can vote, I have a lot to figure out. I'm just beginning life. 

I'll treat myself tomorrow, I'll order in a LOT of food, and binge watch my favorite movie saga. I'm so proud of myself!!! 😎"
happy,"It's been a long journey with a lot of ups and downs, but I've finally found myself a job I can manage with hours that work for me despite my disability - and I thought I was doing ok, but it turns out I've been doing great! I work in health care and it's really important to me that my patients feel cared for and respected, so I'm overjoyed that I've apparently got so much positive feedback from my patients, as well as the other medical staff I work with. I'm not naturally a ""people person"" so it's pretty exhausting putting on my mask for every person who walks through my door, but this makes it feel worthwhile. 

To everyone who worries that they'll never be able to manage in the workplace, don't lose hope! When you're ready, keep searching and the right job could come along when you least expect it. I was struggling so much after years of trying to survive in the workplace that I ended up on a disability pension, deemed unable to work at all. Now I do five mornings a week, which isn't a lot by ""normal people"" standards, but I'm proud that I've made it this far. It's not the job I dreamed of doing and it isn't prestigious or glamorous but it's important work that I'm providing to the community. Everyone has something they can offer to the world, for some of us it just takes longer to find it. "

happy,"Got my dog a toy today at a local ranch supply store. This was supposed to be the be all end all toy for destructive dogs. She managed to tear chunks out of it in 5 minutes flat. I wrote the company and said nice try, but it just didn't hold up. Company wrote back and said that only about 5% of dogs globally could defeat their rubber toys. As my puppy was one of those 5%, would I allow her to become a tester for their company? Heck yes, I'll let her do that. Whether they pay me, or whether they just send free toys, it's still a win for me and my American Bully XL.

ETA, this was an off brand toy, not the well known super duty one."
happy,"Hello everyone! If you look on my profile I’ve posted once a year about my weight loss. I started originally at 320 (although I was too embarrassed to admit it) and got to I think 250 before I got hurt, gained more weight, lost some. Now for 2023. Over the end of 2022 and into 2023 I let a coworker treat me to lunch every day. Where I ate a ton and really fell back into my old terrible habits and all that.
Since September something in me changed. (Also me and that coworker stopped talking, they were a terrible influence but I’m not go into that here) I have cut out most sugars and in general crappy food out. I usually eat one good meal a day. 
I originally started this just to lose weight out of embarrassment of how bad I had let myself go. Now, I just want to feel better. I’ve seen how much my diet change has improved how I feel and the lost weight helps a ton too. I feel so much better about myself. I just want to change now for the betterment of my health, now for how I look.
So here’s my post this year to keep myself accountable (and also people have said they wanted to see my updates as the years go on)
My end goal right now for this year is to be near 220, but I’d REALLY like to be under 200. So let’s see how 2024 will treat me and you and I hope we can accomplish our goals. If you made it this far reading, I thank you! See you next year!"
happy,She's old enough to follow along and we played a cupcake gathering boardgame. I grew up playing lots of games and I'm just so psyched about more! We followed about 90% of the rules and we had a blast!

happy,"Being funny and having a sense of humor and quick wit is something that's always mattered to me. Whenever somebody tells me I'm funny or laughs at my jokes it makes me feel really good.

I tend to have kinda shitty self-esteem so being told to my face something like that with any kind of regularity means a lot. It's nice to be secure in something that matters to me."
happy,I was in a bowling league for 4 years up until 2020 and they had to end the league due to covid. I got super unmotivated about everything and I didn't rejoin when it opened. For Christmas I asked for a new bowling ball because I want to play in a league again. I got my ball but leagues aren't available yet so I've been practicing on my own. I'm already better than I used to be and more consistent. My previous record was a 217 from 2019. Last night I bowled a 213 and then a 224. I'm gonna light up the league 😊
happy,I’m 44. Never thought I’d have kids. Today that changed. Say hi to Annie.
happy,My derpy boy also loves me unconditionally and if he loves me I can love myself like my cat loves me.
happy,"i'm going home and i'm so happy!

So for some context, I moved out to attend university over 6 months ago. It has been a tough but enjoyable experience so far and i have learnt many new things and made some new friends. Not a bad experience at all. However, i haven't seen my family and my cat (my pride and joy) since i left and i dearly miss them.

Today, my mom and i booked me a flight back home to visit for a whole month. I am so happy that i am full on happy sobbing. It doesn't seem like that much of a big deal, but it is to me and i am beyond excited!"

happy,"I have always worked construction and trades jobs my whole life but a few years ago I took a leap and decided to do something with my creative side. It has always been my dream to work in a creative field as I’ve always loved art and design. So I’ve been going to university for graphic design for the past two years online. I’ve been working meaningless part time jobs in retail and maintenance to pay my bills while going to school. 

A little while ago my friend gave me a tip that his company was hiring and it’s in the industry. Long story short I beat the other applicants and was hired!!! I am now a layout editor for a media company. I specialize in newspaper page layouts. For the first time in my life I’m actually making a living wage and can afford to live normally. Nothing fancy but I’m doing more than just surviving now. I couldn’t be happier. Follow your dreams kids!!"

happy,"I know I know; every community has it's toxic weeds that grow.

But so far my experience on Reddit has been like a walk in the park, and I'm just happy to read so many well written, sad, happy, funny, thought provoking, and interesting  posts/stories!

I always heard Reddit getting made fun of for the most part (and for good reason at times well deserved ofc) and even heavily bashed or told it was a ""cesspool of nasty to absolutely stay away from"".

 I stayed away for a long time, like the plague indeed, but I thought, ""Why not personally give it a shot,"" and see what happens, eh?

Never been a big social media person anyway since I'm not the best at being social, writing, taking pics, or navigating around strangers, so I'm beyond impressed so far with the community and am just happy my experience thus far has been good. :) 

And I'm just giddy to see what great, terrible, hilarious, irksome, and strange posts are yet to come.
Not to be sappy, I'm just happy to enjoy something new and am trying to find happy things to experience, especially with how lucky I am to be alive now.

Simple pleasures are my go to and I'm just getting older and more years are silently passing by. 
And I'm learning how to be a better writer thanks to y'all! I haven't written since high school, and am falling in love all over again with this hobby. 

I haven't seen such good writing, interesting stories, or funny jokes in ages. Impressed and can't wait to be more impressed and, somehow, even let down someday 😅if that even is something to look forward to."
happy,"

I guess I'm just trying to put some good vibes for myself out on a night where I feel rather low. I honestly didn't think I could get this far but since February I've lost 32lbs according to my scale this morning. It's probably more once I poop...if I poop."
happy,"Recently, I went to the movie theater with my kid, and while we were waiting for the movie to start, we played duck-catching. We were both thrilled to catch two of them, and I was delighted to capture this moment. I sincerely felt that happiness can be found in the simplest of things and tastes even better when the joy is shared with a loved one."
happy,"this morning, my boyfriend had to get up before i did. our room was kinda cold so he put his blanket on top of me so i had two blankets and i was soooo warm and comfy :’) (we sleep with separate blankets because we both tend to pull it away from each other in our sleep when we share one lol)

he knows i was really anxious about going to work today so he got me a cup of coffee and brought it to me at work before he headed to work himself. i feel so happy i could cry. he takes such good care of me and i really couldn’t ask for anyone better. he’s my whole world :)"
happy,"Truly grateful for the folks i work with. Even with the bittersweet end of our restaurant tomorrow, the moments we had during service and after are that of family. 

Who knew such people could literally save my life and give me hope for my future. 

Just grateful."
happy,"Today's been a really lovely. I felt so at peace handwashing antique quilts in textile cleaner to remove the yellow age stains so they become like new again, just a couple spots need to be patched up and already have some choice fabrics in mind (got some really nice cotton calico prints at a free sale a couple years ago and a few nice quilt squares at a church sale). Save that project for a rainy day. Went out to some yard sales today and got some nice antique furniture for really cheap and some work clothes. I love looking at how they joined wood furniture back then, no nails or screws, just complex wood joinery and yet it's so unbelievably sturdy. The solid cedar wardrobe needs to be stripped, sanded and stained with a wood oil but it's lovely and has a cute little mirror and hanger and everything. I really loved how helpful the gentleman selling it was too. He helped carry the furniture into my vehicle and he just seemed really kind and gentle. His mum raised him right. Something about this being his mum's furniture is bittersweet. That's the wonderful thing about these older pieces, they're loved and I hope whoever takes on these pieces after me, loves them equally as much. I do wonder sometimes who the craftsman is behind all of this. It's kind of paying tribute to his art and how it carries on after death. 😊🥰"

happy,"These past few days, my boyfriend and I have been spending a lot of time on calls, sharing what our everyday lives look like. Since then, I have learned a lot about him: he hates when people eat messy stuff in his car, he likes a slightly messy room but not too much, and he really thinks it's important to have a cup holder when you're drinking in bed. But most importantly, when he sleeps, he snores a little bit. It's the cutest thing I've ever heard in my whole life. Maybe I'm just so in love, but hearing him sleep like that, with his little sounds, makes my heart so fuzzy. I love every little thing about him, every little quirk."

I showered, and am now in bed just happy. I’ve been the “fix it” ticket guy at the court house and I just don’t want to continue bothering the police department with my lack of due diligence for my slowly ailing car. Luckily I didn’t get any infractions for the headlight out but it works now! It’s a nice car for me, unfortunately it’s just so old and I am not financially ahead enough on everything to pay the amount it needs; that’s why I work on it myself. Pay day is just around the corner and I’m just happy and feeing secure bundled up.  "

happy,"There's this old couple in our hood, Mr. and Mrs. Johnson. Super cute. Mr. J decided to recreate their first date for Mrs. J. Picnic in the backyard, candles, the whole deal. Mrs. J walks in, totally surprised and thrilled.

They spend the evening laughing, reminiscing, just being adorable. Now here's the cool part – word gets out, and suddenly, the whole neighborhood catches this happy bug.

People start doing little nice things for each other – helping out, checking in. It's like Mr. J's love move sparked this happiness wave in the community.

Lesson learned? A bit of love goes a long way. One sweet gesture can set off a whole chain of good vibes. Who knew a recreated first date could kickstart a happiness epidemic, right? "

I was just endlessly scrolling when I got a call from an old highschool friend of mine. What's funny is that I've always wanted to contact my old highschool friends but insecurities and self doubt always gets the better of me.

He called me to ask how I was doing, and of course I lied and said I was doing OK. He said he was doing fine too and we talked for a bit. And he also asked that we should hang out sometime, and said sure. 

I know it might seem sad and pathetic to be happy over a call but that made me feel good."

happy,"Has a sad start, but trust me it’s really nice once you read it all.


Long story short many years ago I had a lot of falling out with people I cared about. All my fault. Since then I thought of myself as a horrible person due to the guilt and shame. Lead me down a dark road. Even tried to kill myself in 2022 due to it all since it was getting harder and harder to handle. 

Last night I decided to reach out on social media to one of them who I had falling out with in 2019. He accepted the apology. He even said everything was alright. How he moved on for everything, and then we wished each other well.

This came to a shock to me. Honestly I thought he was gonna get angry at me, but no. Was very sweet really. 

The next morning I decided to reach out to anyone else I could to apologize, to forgive them, or just to send thanks. Really was a great feeling to do. Gave myself closure and even them if they needed it. Plus, I think it was good for me to thank the people in my life who treated me well too. 

Some haven’t responded or even said much, but that doesn’t matter. My actions I took made me forgive myself regardless. 

I feel so much peace. Serenity and contempt all over my body. Almost as if a giant weight was lifted from my body and now the wound is stitched and healed. 

Can’t remember the last time I felt like this. It’s a beautiful feeling and I hope get to experience it too. "

happy,I've never experienced love like this before. I'm actually happy now ☺️
happy,"Title seems conceited, I know, but I have been with fever the past few days and I just forced myself to go out so my brother will have company on the long lines at the cashier.

You see, I like dressing up a lot and I still did it earlier. I tucked a red sweatshirt on a pink skirt and matched it with my pink heels and bag.

At the grocery store, a promoter of something asked me to take a picture with them, and I did! I was genuinely happy about that because someone noticed my style.

We went to another mall because the first store was a bit lacking. While I was looking for food containers to put my desserts in, a saleslady complimented my heels!

I am elated and inspired to go out wearing what I want now! ❤️❤️❤️"
happy,"I'm an artist in NYC and the last several months have been brutally slow. After a lot of exhausting work, and serious anxiety about what they would say, not 1 but both people who reached out to me said they were going through with their purchases!!! I am soooooo happy and relieved!!! I'll be taking myself out to dinner tomorrow to celebrate 🥳 🎉  The first painting was called ""A Summer Daydream"" and the second was ""Health, Wealth, Prosperity."" Both acrylic on canvas and lots of love! Cheers to a great new year!! ✨️🥰✨️"
happy,Cancer free
happy,They have had issues with past pregnancies and I know it weighed heavy on them. I'm just so happy this pregnancy worked out for them. Their daughter is so beautiful and I can't help but share it wherever I can
happy,"Not only was I drinking out of despair for my unfortunate life, but I was making my life more unfortunate with drinking. I was depressed. Couldn’t hold a job. Was in debt. Unhealthy life habits and terribly unhealthy, both physically and mentally. Had toxic friendships and relationships. Deep down I hated myself and thought it was the life I deserved, and I couldn’t ever live a happy life. 9 months ago I decided to change that. My whole life has turned around! I’ve lost weight, am finally experiencing true happiness, have a wonderful partner and meaningful relationships, am constantly working on making my self and life better, and may even be able to retire before I hit 30.  Oh, and I am nearly 3 months sober of weed as well!!!!

Today is such a good day. "
happy,"My birthday was the 27th and I received money for letting me buy supplies to try sculpting for the first time. I went to Micheal’s and got everything I needed! The wonderful cashier gave me a discount and I was able to add a few more things I’d been eyeing! 

I drew ideas for figurines ages ago and I finally get to turn one of them into a reality!! This is my progress so far! I’ve never sculpted clay before but I have done some models on ZBrush and watched a few tutorials on working the clay, so I had an idea of how things were going to go. I’m doing piece by piece and then putting them all together at the end. I plan to paint and varnish it as well!! 

I’ve had a lot of fun so far and I’m really excited to finish it!!"
happy,"I'm big into the local music scene as a local musician, amateur gig photographer, and just general lover of grassroots music. For my birthday, my boyfriend secretly set-up a non-profit music promoter enterprise, booked four of my favourite local bands to play at a local grassroots venues on my birthday weekend, and arranged for all ticket sales to go to one of my favourite local charities! 

It's without a doubt the most thoughtful thing anyone has ever done for me, and I'm totally blown away by it! 

"
happy,"This isn't an advertisement or anything like that, I just love it. 

I work two jobs from home, and I didn't follow the advice of ""Separate your work space from your personal space"" (it's better for your mental health) so I spend effectively 13 hours a day at my desk, with my work PC and personal PC on the same desk right next to one another. I flip my monitor between PCs, so the space I used to go to to have fun, play games, and hang out with online friends is effectively ruined by 13 hours a day being trapped in this spot. I work from 5AM-7PM and get one single day off a week. Of COURSE I'm not going to want to spend another *second* of my time at that desk than I have to. 

Obviously, this caused all my steam games to go neglected, as well as the couple little online friends I keep up with. This simply can't do. So, I bought a steam deck. 

What a wonderful little handheld computer! It can run a few itch.io games on it, they don't even have to be steam games! And there's a game from 2005 that REALLY DIDN'T like the steam deck when I first launched it (The fucking mouse cursor was controlled by the gyro function for some reason?!) but the controls are so customizable on that thing that within just 20 or 30 minutes of messing with it I got it running so comfortably that it's not just tolerable but *enjoyable* to play on the deck. I love it. It was so easy to figure out, so easy to personalize, and it's just great. 

I play games more now than I even did on my PC before I was work from home. In fact, I prefer the steam deck over my PC. I'm just not a graphics-heavy gamer and the games I play don't require fast reflexes and pinpoint accuracy, so the deck is perfect for my style of single player meandering-along story games. And I always tended to enjoy a controller more than mouse and keyboard anyway. So, just having all my games be mobile?! Man. Least regrettable big purchase I have made in a WHILE. I would buy a new one tomorrow if my current one broke. 

Again, not an advertisement. I'm just a casual gamer, with casual games, which I love to casually enjoy. And the invention of such a neat, user friendly, handheld ""gaming"" computer makes me happy. Happy-happy!!! 

Edited to add: Oh, didn't even mention. The #1 benefit is that I can be snuggled up to my family members while gaming! That's honestly the main reason I bought it. I love the people I live with and being trapped in my room all the time means I can't see them, and if I wanted to game, I'd have to take away even more time from the 3 hours a day I get to visit with them. The steam deck gives me the benefit of cuddles AND gaming. Truly living the life here, folks. "
happy,"Apparently one night while I was extremely tired, I told him I really wanted a tiny spoon to eat with. He remembered and gave them to me a few days ago. Will forever use these things <3"
happy,Had to get lab work today and found this on the way out! I DO feel lucky! 
happy,We’ve been dating for a year and about five months? They picked me up from my apartment and we went to a really nice restaurant. I was panicking so much.
happy,"We sat and talked for 6 hours yesterday and she said a lot of sweet things to me; like saying I was one of the best things to happen to her (I said that one first; she just said it back). I wish I wrote down the rest of them because I already forgot most of it (my memory is so bad and my life is so dramatically different than it was 3 months ago; new huge things are happening every week; last night I just got the keys to a house on the beach in Venice). There was one thing she said which did stick out, though:

""You're my type: extraordinary.""

No one has ever come close to making me that happy with less than 6 words.

Anyway, I'm about to make one of the biggest pivots of my life. I got an offer to leave the US and move to Switzerland\* and possibly Germany for a bit, so I'm working to change every last piece of me that has been holding me back. I don't know what I will resemble at the end of this, but I know, to at least one person, one of the most amazing people I've ever met, they found me extraordinary at one point in my life.

I honestly don't know that I could ask for a better compliment.

Anyway.

To future me, if you end up reading this, and you're feeling down, you were extraordinary to one of the most amazing people you ever met. That should not ever not matter to you.

\* it was somehow endearing how upset she got over this; I hate hurting her, even if it was inadvertent, but seeing her very upset texts burst through as I'm ""reviving"" my dead phone from an eventful night, was so \*damn\* heart-warming."
happy,"I fully expected and accepted a request for cash from my teen nibbling instead I got this. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am a native English speaker, nibbling is not. "
happy,"Hello everyone! If you look on my profile I’ve posted once a year about my weight loss. I started originally at 320 (although I was too embarrassed to admit it) and got to I think 250 before I got hurt, gained more weight, lost some. Now for 2023. Over the end of 2022 and into 2023 I let a coworker treat me to lunch every day. Where I ate a ton and really fell back into my old terrible habits and all that.
Since September something in me changed. (Also me and that coworker stopped talking, they were a terrible influence but I’m not go into that here) I have cut out most sugars and in general crappy food out. I usually eat one good meal a day. 
I originally started this just to lose weight out of embarrassment of how bad I had let myself go. Now, I just want to feel better. I’ve seen how much my diet change has improved how I feel and the lost weight helps a ton too. I feel so much better about myself. I just want to change now for the betterment of my health, now for how I look.
So here’s my post this year to keep myself accountable (and also people have said they wanted to see my updates as the years go on)
My end goal right now for this year is to be near 220, but I’d REALLY like to be under 200. So let’s see how 2024 will treat me and you and I hope we can accomplish our goals. If you made it this far reading, I thank you! See you next year!"
happy,"It feels like I’m dreaming. Two of the hardest years of my life are finally over. I also got a job offer yesterday. Everything always works out in the end, I just never thought that it would work out this good."
happy,"I’m a friendly person so I know or recognize a lot of folks in person, but I am dogshit at recalling names. 

She said hello to me first and I said, “hey (redacted)!” and we had a nice chat about living here. Sounds like the last person to live in my place was really neat, so I have some cool shoes to fill! 

Hooray for small steps in self improvement and mundane conversations!"
happy,"after dealing with anxiety my whole life and suffering a lot of traumatic events, i finally got the help i needed (prozac/fluoxetine) !!

i finally feel happy and less anxious, im arguing with my dad less and things are looking up ! yay !!!! 😁 life is good and it DOES in fact get better"
happy,I’m 44. Never thought I’d have kids. Today that changed. Say hi to Annie.
happy,I still feel happy to be a part of this country 😊 flaws of course but how else would I be able to help if not becoming a citizen. 
happy,"Sorry for the late post, I was busy today so I didn't get my walk in until 7pm. But I made up for it with a picture of something else other than a view! I walked about 2 miles, mostly because I was given permission to walk around the properties on the hill. 

I've also decided to switch to weekly updates, as I don't want to clog r/happy with just my posts. It's just not fair to other posters. 

I love y'all and if you need anything, a pep talk, walking advice, or just wanna talk please feel free to DM me, as I'm alwaysore than happy to talk. Cheers!"
happy,"My dad and his girlfriend probaply tought that i needed a younger sibling to get my s*** together lol i visited them every weekend she didn't complain when i said that i wanted to change diapers ""oh yeah? go for it sweetie"" god i can still smell the 💩 lol"
happy,She was on opiates/heroin really hard but i loved her even then and just hoped she could over come it.  She did and we got togethor and have a beautiful 5 month old daughter. Anyone out there using you can beat that *%#!. 
happy,GRAD SCHOOL HERE I COME WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
happy,"I recently met someone. Our first date was during the work week, we met for drinks and ended up talking for 6 hours! Our second date was yesterday. It was so nice. We had ice cream and  went to the museum. He’s smart and funny. Artistic and creative. We had great conversation and he was a complete gentleman. He texted today and asked to go on a proper dinner date. 
I’m looking forward to seeing where this could go. ☺️ "
happy,"
I have been bullied for a lot of my childhood for various reasons and one of them was me being a little chubby (I was not even overweight) so it naturally destroyed my self confidence and caused me to develop anxiety and even depression at one point. I also struggle with binge eating while stressed. 

Now growing up my parents might have made a few mistakes here there that I could not handle but lately they seem to talk to me in a more positive and mature manner and it warms my heart. I know for a fact that they had to unlearn certain behaviours and ideas to have this outlook.


For example the other day I noticed that my favourite pair of jeans started ripping apart near the thigh area and I was beating myself up for it getting torn because I have put on weight since I bought them two years back. My parents casually reassured me that it was just a piece of clothing and I can always get a new pair that fits me perfectly. They also said clothes are meant to fit you and not the other way around . It might not sound much to them but for me it was a huge deal. 

Also I love dressing masculine and wearing clothes from men’s section all the time, even though I personally think clothes are genderless but corporate world doesn’t really think the same right, so we happen to have a lot of stores that exclusively sell menswear. When I first started to ask my mom to take me the store she immediately took me there no questions asked, she never says anything to me when getting clothes from the men’s section. I know this is how it should be but I know a lot of friends who aren’t allowed to do the same.  I mentioned this to her and she casually went clothes are for comfort and people can wear whatever they want as long as they feel good wearing them 😭❤️

These things may not look like a big deal to everyone but I know little me would be jumping with joy right now."
happy,"It took a lot of saving, moving things around financially, and sacrificing. I’m looking to improve my finances (and my life) in the future, but it’s good to have hope for once. Really was worried I’d miss the deadline. 

Sorry, I known I’ve been a problem , and I have no one who really cares enough in my life to share this with. Thank you guys for allowing me."

happy,"I was born in the early 80's and I have been obsessed with The Gremlins ever since it was released. I told my husband I begged my parents for Spike from the movie for 3 years in a row when I was younger. Of course, that wasn't a possibility, but it didn't quite sink in until I was older. I opened a specialty toy set with a large Spike Gremlin and a little Gizmo yesterday; it arrived a bit late due to the first one getting lost in the mail and major shipping delays for the replacement. It was such a nice surprise during the cold snap here and the first weekend of Dry January."
happy,"Thrilled to be in our new house!  We've been in an apartment for the last 5 years.  Today, I'm opening moving boxes, cleaning...and turning up the music as LOUD as I want!  I've been waiting for this for so long!!

happy,She marked her 3rd year sober Friday.
happy,One of my closest friends went to NYC in an au pair exchange and I painted one of my favorite photos of us  with watercolor and then I gave it to her at the airport before she got on the plane! 💗 She loved btw and it's now on her bedside table in her bedroom at her host family house. 
happy,"Just wanted to share this small victory, since im feeling hella good abt it.  
I tried to filter a dataframe for certain items, but it always gave me the code ""undefined columns selected"". I couldn´t solve it for literal DAYS and it really frustrated me to the point of crying.

  
Turns out i just forgot that the items had a headline in the program! So no wonder i defined them wrongly! I forgot that i didn´t turn off the headline while importing the dataset, and that´s why it always gave me that error!

  
I know i´m not a genius, but i feel absolutely undefeatable right now.

Thanks for reading my small vent :)"
happy,"And I just...

It feels so good.

Another friend, let's call her M, became super super super close with me over the past 2 months.

Anyway, tonight, my oldest friend (I've known her for like 26 years; she was my first girlfriend at like 13 years old), let's call her A, said she was really jealous about M and I was like why? And she told me she was super possessive of me.

I've always had a thing for A (except while I was in relationships) and I... guess all the signs were there. I mean... the last time we hung out she was grinding her butt all over my leg for like 20 minutes straight while I was chatting with friends at a house party. She also always makes sure to tell me she loves me before we get off the phone and she's not even remotely an affectionate woman.

I cant believe how oblivious I was.. Autism i guess haha

3 months ago I thought I was going to be alone forever. And now this on top of everything else.

Fuck 😊

I'm so happy."
happy,"hey! I woke up at 6am, took a shower and started my work shift until 1pm. then I went to my classes at 2 to 6pm. btw I had meal in breaks (it's importantfor me to praise myself for it). and after that I had enough power to do myhomework! I proud of myself really

I hope you y'all have a nice time "
happy,"I’ve done an emotional 180 over the past two years for the better! These books have helped me more than therapy, antidepressants, and sleeping pills. Some of them contain spirituality but can be enjoyed by any religion. I tell everyone I know about them and just wanted to share here!"
happy,"today i got in a car accident. i wasn't doing well lately and that car accident and the headache made me go in deep episode of depression. 

later i found myself in a ai image generator. i asked it to make one of my happiest days in the not so happy life of mine. and you know what? it didn't disappoint me.

this is a date i had with my love of life. it was beautiful day. i wore red polo shirt that she gave me in my birthday (she is one of 2 people who cares about my birthday) and she wore this outfit (pink skirt, white shir, pink hijab) that she wore in the day that i started loving her. before that we used to be friends, and we spoke a lot. i used to think of her as the coolest girl out there. and she thought of me like this as well (yes i said cool, yes we were young and yes i still do think of her as the coolest girl out ther). one day we decide to meet, i went to to that location, when i saw her from a distance and she smiled at me from far, wearing this outfit it i fall in love, 

we met to give her her birthday present (black hijab from the type she loves so much but she didn't have a black one, and inside of it i put a kindder surprise as a extra surprise for later).

so later in the relationship after i confessed and growing together loving each other more and more, we met in one of our walk dates (dates is kinnda illegal here) i wore this shirt that she gave me and a bracelet that she made for me before my confession (really sweet gift), and she wore my favorite outfit she had (she knows how to make me happy).

in this date we hold hands for the first time ever. we have been loving each other for over a year and half by now. (i know it may be something alien to most of you but we live in different place with different rules.)

so this is a small part of our story. it made me happy to remember these days even with all of my cournt problems.


thank you for reading. i hope you have a happy day as well <3"
happy,I think I'm off to good start today
happy,"I don't have a college degree but scrounged hard to climb a ladder and managed to get software engineering level 2 yesterday! My boss asked to talk to me and I thought it was about a new application I they had mentioned they wanted me to work with but he had an offer letter for me to sign instead!


I don't really have friends or family to talk about it with so l'm posting here if that's okay. Started from an entry position analyst to engineer in 5 years, now I'm here after 4 more years. I don't have my parents anymore so I guess I'll look for phrase on Reddit 🩷"
happy,I remember just a few months ago I couldn't even do 10! Let alone get down and do some more afterwards!
happy,A small achievement 
happy,"When I'll start earning my own income, I'll definitely have my personal libary within my room! I really want to discover, read and acquire new books!

happy,"[unrelated image]
Hi, i just got in high school last week and I didn't know anyone except for a friend of mine that ended up on the same school as me. A friend of her  also ended up there (wich i didn't know until yesterday). I just think it's worth to say that my social skills are terrible (expected from a reddit user lol), and i just find so difficult to start conversations, meeting people and stuff like that. On the first week i was dead silent, didn't talk to anyone, i was too shy and embarrassed, and felt like i would be a inconvenience to anyone just trying to stay in peace. Then yesterday (second week already), that friend of mine and her friend were talking to each other and they came to my desk to say something, and just stayed there for the rest of the lunch break, and we talked for a while until the class resumed. But today was even cooler, some of the teachers didn't show up on class, and we just talked the entire time about our lives. And believe it or not, it gets even cooler: we live in the same region, so we get the same buses on our way to home, and guess what: we talked the entire way lol. It just feels so nice to have someone to talk with that isn't on the internet, i was really missing that in-person social interactions haha.
Anyway, i think I've never typed so much in english, I hope only the best for y'all, cya ;P"
happy,"Today I (17 m) was home alone and started to take out the ingredients (pasta and frozen cubed chicken) but then I thought f*ck it, imma be brave today and boil frozen meat balls in tomato sauce instead of just heating up the chicken in the microwave. It went much better than the last times, I didn’t even think I  would start a fire, unlike the other times. I’m so proud of myself!"
happy,"I just feel ecstatic this week full of pride for myself.  I grew up around alot of drugs and awful people, not awful in the sense that they did bad things but awful in the sense they had lost themselves in a pit of drugs and self depreciation.  My mom and my grandma were both addicted to opioid painkillers for like all of my childhood and I never knew my dad so my grandpa raised me and he was a great man he taught me alot of things a dad should like how to shave how to treat people and generally what it means to be a good person.  But nobody lives forever and when he passed things got worse and I was eventually taken by Arkansas CPS when i was 16 in late 2018 and given to my Great Grandma.  Lived with her for a bit then she decided she didn't want me and my oldest sister.  It hurt alot hearing someone just say they didn't want you when you expect them to care for you.  So I was placed in the foster system in January 2019 met lots of good people while I was in the system and I still talk to my foster mom.  I got out of the system in 2022 and left Kansas to come back home to Arkansas and I found myself surrounded by a whole new side of my family my mom had hidden from me my whole life, My Aunt Jamie and her wife Trey helped me get on my feet and my first place.  But me being new to this whole thing after about a year I lost a good job and in turn lost my place.  And then I met my Dad and he's just such a good person who's given me a firm guiding hand in the right direction which I exactly what I needed so now im an Assistant Manager at my local Dominoes and I plan on working here until September or November to say I have a year's worth of Management Experience then looking for a better paying job and this Saturday I'm moving into a new Apartment using all the money I've worked so hard for to save up and I'm just so happy and proud of myself.  And I'm thankful that I got to meet all this family I never knew cared so much about me for so long.  2025 is going to be my year, I hope to finally be able to really worm on myself and keep this winning streak going because this has been the best year or two of my life I'm happier than I've ever been and it's all thanks to my new friends and family. I'm learning to survive and I have to support system I need to finally make myself the person I want to be and I will never take it for granted. "
happy,Not to Jinx myself and I'm knocking on wood. But next week I've been at my job eleven years. It makes me happy because growing up I had learning issues and was in special Ed. And the teachers were not nice. I was told I would never go to college and ide never hold a job. I have so far done both. And I feel..well proud of myself in a way I've beaten odds and expectations. I was told i would be nothing but a failure.
happy,"My sister has just passed her Business Tax exam after having struggled with it before. I am so incredibly proud of her. She's already a good Accountant but that piece of paper is unfortunately what you need to show it. I knew she'd get there in the end and she has achieved success today. She is going to go so far in her career and I couldn't be happier. Well done you superstar!

🥳👏🎉"
happy,"I’m traveling in Korea at the moment.  Japan last week.  Life is good despite all the info to the contrary.  Find time to enjoy and reflect on how far you’ve come.  We are living in the best of times, believe it or not.  Hugs to all. "
happy," I go to a university and I just started going to counseling there. I like counseling it gives me a chance to vent. Anyways Tuesday I will take the bus to school, go to my classes, after my classes I will have 3 and a half hours to kill so I will go to a movie at a movie theater two blocks from school, after the movie I will likely get something to eat and sit on my laptop until its time for my appointment, then I will go to my appointment and talk with the counselor about some issues. My sister said she can pick me up that night so no riding the bus for two hours that night! I will then get home and play my PS5 for a few hours then go to bed. I have only seen this counselor once so far but I am so looking forward to dumping more of my issues on her! "
happy,"So I’m 17 and an engineering intern. I started last year mid-February and it’s been going pretty good. At Christmas, I got a $330 bonus ($200 after taxes) and I was super happy with that. Today, my boss stopped by my office and said they usually give out year end bonuses but their system wasn’t working right this year so it was a bit late. He said to remember that I’m only really part time and when I said I appreciate it no matter what he said “it’s better than a stick in the eye”. 

So after he said that, I thought it was gonna be like $100 max right, but I open it and see ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS!! It’s $640 after taxes and I know that isn’t a ton to some people BUT I AM SUPER HAPPY. And yesterday I found out I’m getting $1500 back in taxes so I am going to be absolutely ballin!!!! HELL YEAH!!!"
happy,"I hope he was talking about post-serum! 

But in all seriousness, made my day. When kids are nice, it just seems so genuine. Same kid also asked me if I was a D1 basketball player while I was shooting around (I’m not even close!)

Anyway, it just made me happy."
happy,Me and my wife have been together 20 years in October and married 16 in November. As long as I've known her she's been a smoker. I was a smoker myself. I finally kicked the habit three years ago. Bur my wife has been incredibly stubborn on the subject. Today we talked for a while and she decided to take steps to quit. I couldn't be happier with this decision. I'm aware that this will not he easy but she's at least willing. And I'm gonna stand by her and take all the crap that comes with quitting. If it means she can improve her health and I can have her longer I am more than willing to be her punching bag for a few weeks. I'm very proud because she really didn't want to do this. 
happy,"I’m so happy, I could cry "
happy,"I'm 28 years old. I graduated high school early and expectations were high for me even though I lived in a toxic sometimes abusive household. I worked in a restaurant to claw myself out of the gutter, and ended up with pretty severe addiction problems. Over 2 years ago I decided I wanted to break the cycle of mental illness and addiction in my family. I wanted to work on my mental health, but I knew that meant recovery. I went to treatment, found a form of therapy that worked for me and after 2 years of individual with a year of group therapy in there I have evolved! Not only did I get a day job that I love and feel valued at, but I also began school in January! My first term just ended, and I got A's in my two classes! And I got 100% in my favorite class of all time!! A good friend of mine went to some nice schools in the area but he's been beyond supportive throughout my journey so I texted him about school and that was his response. I'm so blessed. Good friends, just got a raise and more hours at my day job, we have partial custody over my step son, and I'm doing great mentally and emotionally on top of it all! IF I CAN DO IT YOU CAN DO IT TOO! LOVE YOU ALL TGIF I GET TO SAY THAT NOW AFTER QUITTING THE RESTAURANT LIFE IT KEEPS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER YALL XOXOXOXOXOX"
happy,"A day ago I posted about how happy and excited I was that I made a plan to visit my boyfriend suddenly! And he was surprised a lot! But today he surprised me back by proposing me 😅🥺 So apparently he had plans to propose me before but the ring wasn’t delivered on time , so he was planning to propose me later this month. But since I visited him suddenly, he took this opportunity to surprise me back by taking out the ring at this magical hike we had today. This is probably the best thing ever happened to me, the uno reverse we all need in life ! 😭🤍✌️"
happy,"Husband had to work in Kinross, but stayed in St Ignace. Someday we'll make it up to Mackinac in the Summer, but for now I can have the fudge! The kids each got chocolate, I have Turtle, Sea salt and caramel, and chocolate peanut butter."
happy,"Hi, Everyone.

I was going to wait a week, but I had to create an account and post this because I’m just too happy to keep it inside anymore.

A few days ago, my wife posted on this board. She was having a tough time sleeping, and in the middle of this rough night, the thought of something I did brought a smile to her face. She shared that moment with everyone here, and in response, the amount of goodwill and kindness that flowed from this community was overwhelming. 

She kept this post secret from me—never expecting it to make other than a few people smile. Little did she know, it would gain a ton of traction. The generosity and support that followed made it tough for her to conceal, and eventually, she showed me the thought that made her so happy this past Monday at 3 A.M..

My wife is amazing. I’m so happy, lucky, and fortunate to be in that group of people who have truly found their soulmate. My heart becomes full just thinking about her, and sometimes I just say her name randomly because it makes me happy to hear. I love her so much, and I can’t stop smiling right now.

I also want to take a moment to thank everyone in this community. What you all did truly shows the amazing types of people you are. From the messages of encouragement, to the acts of support, it’s a been such a joy. I’ll never forget any of it, and when I called my mother to tell her about what everyone here did, it seriously made her day.

Thank you all so much. You made my wife happy. You made my mom happy. For that, I will forever be grateful, and I promise to do my best to spread all the positive energy you gave us back out into the world.

This truly is the bright center of the Internet."
happy,Edit: Guys I’m blown away from the feedback. I wasn’t expecting this to get as much love as it did. I think it just goes to show that happiness can be simple and doesn’t require any extravagant justifications for sharing your feelings. r/happy is such a great community. 
happy,"I've been sad for nearly 2 years after my best friend completely moved on from me after 13 years. I'm not longer angry or sad about it. 

I can't change it. She's happy now, and that's all I wish for her. I'm at peace with the whole situation at last. I'm happy knowing she's happy, and that we can still be friends, even if we're not as close. 

I think of our memories fondly, and not in sadness. And I feel so much more free, it's always been in the back of my mind since it happened, and when I first thought of her today I just felt alright. Life will do what it will. I absolutely can't wait to make new friends"
happy,"It took a lot of saving, moving things around financially, and sacrificing. I’m looking to improve my finances (and my life) in the future, but it’s good to have hope for once. Really was worried I’d miss the deadline. 

Sorry, I known I’ve been a problem , and I have no one who really cares enough in my life to share this with. Thank you guys for allowing me."
happy,"Hey all, today I woke up and stepped on a weight scale and saw it was 158.5lbs :) I was around 202lbs when I started and it's amazing I reached into the 150 range, the last recorded weight of me I can remember was being around 160 a couple years back and it has only gone up since then. The fact I'm lower than that makes me extremely proud of myself and that change really is possible! 

It really helps I also have my boyfriend supporting me and he's one of my main motivators, he helps me feel secure and safe :D

There were times I ""failed"" and felt terrible about myself that I didn't keep myself in check, then I always tell myself, ""it's a marathon, not a race"" and that along the way you will have difficulties snacking, plateaus, and others where you just go beyond your calories for the day. But also, times where you'll do it and be succcessful. In the end they all add up and you will see that no matter what, that you DID lose weight because you didn't give up regardless of all the missteps. The smallest steps are my favorite, esp at the beginning! Because something is working. The scale isn't always accurate and fluctuates, so I take pictures and the differenc is very noticable :)

Super proud of myself, and thankful to my boyfriend in this journey."
happy,"Walked around the store today and smiled at a few people sharing glances. It's noticeable their expression changes before you smile at them vs. after. Like, yes old lady checking out the frozen waffles, you deserve smiles and happiness too. 🥰 Makes me extra happy when I do it to other people too, careful guys I'm contagious. You might catch it. 😂"
happy,"I really love him. I spent forever putting his gift together and when I finally gave it to him seeing him cry made me so happy. He said he’s never been loved like this before and that he loves me more than anything. 

I’m just so so happy I get to make him feel loved cause he makes me feel so safe and loved too. I’m not so great with my words like he is but I think this really showed him how I feel :)"
happy,"Got my dog a toy today at a local ranch supply store. This was supposed to be the be all end all toy for destructive dogs. She managed to tear chunks out of it in 5 minutes flat. I wrote the company and said nice try, but it just didn't hold up. Company wrote back and said that only about 5% of dogs globally could defeat their rubber toys. As my puppy was one of those 5%, would I allow her to become a tester for their company? Heck yes, I'll let her do that. Whether they pay me, or whether they just send free toys, it's still a win for me and my American Bully XL.

ETA, this was an off brand toy, not the well known super duty one."
happy,"This is a long, very happy rant. I can't rant out of happiness this hard to anyone in my life rn

I am so happy. I can't stop talking about my glasses and it's probably getting annoying, because everyone has glasses. But I feel like a lot of people just got glasses when they first started needing them and didn't just have terrible vision that was ignored for most of their lives to the point of developing eye problems over it, and then suddenly get it corrected like in an instant, and I literally cannot shut up about it. What I thought was pretty normal vision was actually complete dogshit and now I am seeing things I couldn't even imagine a few weeks ago.

And holy shit. I pretty much immediately got hit with the heavy fist of depth perception for the first time in my life and spent like half an hour touching the sink and putting my hands in the corners of the room because everything was suddenly EXTREMELY 3D. I feel like I am in an actual video game. I used to joke that video games are higher definition than my actual vision but not right now.

Everything is so BRIGHT. Everything is so DETAILED. Grass doesn't all blend together anymore, everything on my shelf is a distinct individual object, I can see a face a few feet away, hell I can read something across the street. It's nuts. Colours are so sharp and saturated now, life isnt a foggy haze around me, everything is in such intense focus and detail I keep just staring at little things and tearing up. 

AND I CAN ACTUALLY READ OH MY GOD. I've been afraid to Crack open a novel because I'm afraid it's going to be too good to be true, but as far as scrolling on my phone, sentences and words are so crisp and distinct. I don't have to hold it at right up to my actual nose, close one eye and squint just to have my eye bounce all over the page and give me a headache after about one sentence. 

And better, I haven't had double vision in days. I used to get it every day like clockwork around 2pm until the end of the day. Since putting on my glasses, I guess my brain just. Isn't trying to mash together two extremely different visual fields anymore and giving up or something (I'm not a doctor, that makes sense to me though)

I'm just losing my mind. I never want to take them off. I have to force myself to take them off at bedtime. I want to order 500 pairs and put them on a special shelf like a shrine lol. I have never been more greatful for anything before.

It's insane how bad I let this get under the guise of ""it's always been like this, it was like this when I grew up, can't imagine it gets that much better than this now."" It's like the Crack in your windshield that you eventually stop noticing until your windshield explodes."
happy,I still feel happy to be a part of this country 😊 flaws of course but how else would I be able to help if not becoming a citizen. 
happy,"I had a girl I’ve been dating over for dinner and drinks last night to celebrate NYE.  Things started getting physical so I suggested going to the bedroom.  It was a hard no.

I was a little bit puzzled (we’ve had sex before).  She then informs me she has her period, appears visibly upset and apologizes.  I sort of start laughing; now she looks puzzled.

I tell her I’m chuckling at the apology; there is absolutely no reason to be sorry and I couldn’t be happier just giving her a kiss at midnight and waking up beside her tomorrow (she’s never spent the night).  I offer her a heating pad, pillows and to run out to grab some midol; whatever she needs to be comfortable, she need only let me know.

The result was a lovely young lady, stunned by the thoughtfulness and filled with appreciation.  Though I invited a ‘date’ over for dinner, we decided to become exclusive and I woke up beside my new ‘girlfriend’ the next morning.

What a great start to 2022.

Edit: inclusion of exclusivity."
happy,"* hang out with people you love. go out, get drunk, have fun. everything in moderation hehe
* touch people. hugs, touches, pets, holding hands, squeezes, cuddles... EVERYTHING
* talk to people. open up. it's okay to allow yourself to be held by the people you want to be cared by. *it's okay to have the selfish desire to be burdensome*. it is OKAY! keep moving. never stay in one place too long (small and large scale). *comfort is the foil of growth.*
* exercise. even if you don't feel like going, just do 15 minutes. the rest will come. and I KNOW you always feel better after moving. whether it be a walk after dinner, a gym run, or even a a simple stretch outside. 
* always push yourself. no matter how hard it seems, you can always go further. one extra lap, minute, or rep... just that extra breath of effort will push you boundlessly. you will realize you can overcome the goals you set for yourself, which slowly seep into the rest of your life. 
* correct negative thoughts gently. when you feel hateful, reflect on your own thoughts. why are you being mean? your inner thoughts heavily influence your perspective on the outer world. humans are creatures of projection, so PLEASE be kind to yourself and others.
* eat breakfast. even if you don't think you want to. a coffee, a fruit, or a slice of bread. I promise that extra boost of energy is worth it. 
* talk to people that make you happy. keep the company of people who uplift you. keep those who support you, purge the ones who denounce you. *may the bridges you burn light the way!* 
* talk less, act more. for me, actions have always spoken louder than words. making less excuses and just doing things will help propel your plot. 
* MUSIC. listen to it, play it, learn it, make it, worship it. make playlists, sing songs, listen with people. it's the best thing to boost you up and feel understood when no one else understands. (the best part about music is there's so freaking much of it you can't possibly find something you don't like)
* question your perspective to the world. think of the external and internal causes that lead you to your beliefs. learn to question EVERYTHING, but keep a grounding foot on your intuition as well.
* don't overthink. if you're self conscious about it, they probably are too. no one is focusing on your faults. you are your biggest critic! 
* you get out what you put out and that's that!

***\* DISCLAIMER: \****

this is the unsolicited advice of a (highly opinionated) 22F yr old onliner, so take everything with a grain of salt. this just happens to be a helpful guide i keep in my notes app and wanted to share. 

on paper, i have no impressive concrete accomplishments in my life. i am a classic instance of a burnt-out-gifted-kid turned college drop out. so, if you would like to tell me i am living my life wrong, go ahead. 

i am quite content. 

i have spent a lot of  time trying to find that sense of normalcy we've all been aching for since graduating high school. it felt like i would never experience that grandiose feeling of truly ""living in the moment"" and ""seeing in color"" again.  i wished the world would pause for me just once. just to allow me to relive a core memory from my childhood again. but alas, that nostalgic relief never comes... 

because truly, life goes on, and it never stops. 

to some, it might sound harsh, but i interpret it as a comfort saying. accepting that ""it is what it is"" but ""what ***will*** be, is in my hands"", is the most important takeaway. 

ultimately, there is no ""cure"" or solution to find happiness. it comes and goes, wanes and rises, just as the moon and the sun! if you remember the world always has balance, whether it be spiritually, mentally, or physically, you begin to understand that 

spread kindness and patience, or don't. it is up to you do as you please! just remember to challenge yourself always, and truly focus with intention.

happy,"Hey All - Just wanted to tell someone other than since I don’t really have any friends. 

Got the promotion at work I’ve been working towards for the last 11 months. Over 125 interviews (internal postings) and I got selected. Beat out very capable individuals, some with 5-7 years of seniority. 

Pretty damn happy. Giving my all each and every day, without exception, finally paid off for me, for once. 
"
happy,"I just wanted to share it with somebody who can appreciate it. I am a young aspiring writer and I have never got actual recognition for it before. It's a small contest, but I am still incredibly overjoyed by it. It was a short story, but I mostly specialise in those anyway. It feels so awesome to have someone see my work and like it.
I'm not even excited about whatever my reward will be. I'm just happy someone read that little story and enjoyed it."
happy,"I’m feeling really proud of myself, and I’m super appreciative of all of the people that gave me feedback and help along the way. Wanted to share this feeling with everyone!!"
happy,"Been talking to this girl for a actually not that long just two or thre months, has not been the best start but currently it's been working really well actually. got to hang out and yeah she's starting to text me on her own whenever we didn't text much throughout the day, asking me how my day has been. Seems stupid but it really means alot to me because i have had a really  exhausting  time with relationships and had little to no female friends and never talking to anyone or socializing for days and feeling left alone and it's been a while since my last relationship that was more than just sleeping together. I mean intimicay doesn't do much for me if i don't feel emotionally connected. Nothing made me happier recently than when she texts me and asks how my day was or when we just talk about Mutual interests and shit. Life has been really good recently."
happy,"I’m so happy, I could cry "
happy,"Even tho it’s quite embarrassing I wanted to share this. This is Caesar my poodle puppy who is ready to greet me early every morning. This means I have to get up and out to walk him first thing, something that I COULD NOT and WOULD NOT ever do before I had him because of my agoraphobia. He has given me more independence and has made me progress so much faster. He even helps with my panic attacks. But most importantly I love him and he makes me happy!"
happy,"What's so special about an office snack drawer?

It sounds funny but I have dreamed of having my own snack drawer at my own desk in my own office for as long as I can remember.  While I may not have my own office, I have a nice cubicle next to a large set of windows in the corner of the building.  It's wonderful!

I spent the better part of a decade getting an undergraduate engineering degree and graduated at 33 while working to support myself and doing extracurricular projects.  There were so many times I just wanted to quit.  I moved around a lot and changed majors at one point so it took a while to get through it all but I did it.  I now work for a company that I've always wanted to work for and I have myself a snack drawer.

It's silly but this snack drawer reminds me of all the blood, sweat, and tears that went into getting my degree and I just feel so accomplished when I turn around, open it, and grab some crackers.  I've come so far since I was waiting tables with no direction in life and it's a nice reminder that all the hard work paid off.  I can't help but smile when I think about it.  Lmao, sounds so weird typing it out but it makes me so happy!"
happy,"These are the things I've quit to be more happy:

Competetive gaming: Its just a bunch of pixels on my screen that has no real value and it also made me lose the fun for videogames over the years. 

Social media: I still use social media but less than before. It took me a long time of self discipline to do that and nowadays I have a screen time of 20 min at best. I also think that social media helped me with that as well because whenever I read comments all I read are either bot comments, brainrot opinions or unnecessary hateful stuff. This also made me realize if the time I put into watching internet content is worth it or not. I have the mindset of using the Internet only for research purposes for things I dont know about so I can learn new stuff.

Bad eating behavior: I used to heavily rely on vitamin pills because I would always refuse to eat certain things because a doctor on YouTube would tell me this is bad or that is bad etc. It really ruined me as a person but today I'm doing a bit better now. I feel more happy now that my body is receiving the natural vitamins which was craving for years.

Being home all the time: I always saw my home as a ""safe"" place where I always wanted to stay all the time. 

Its quite dangerous over time and it does get to you mentally. I wasnt afraid of going outside and I dont have social anxiety but I always felt comfy being home and not doing stuff outside. Nowadays I always try to go outside whenever I can unless Im out of energy. I even bought a professional camera JUST so I can have a reason to go outside and do some nice pictures of nature or other things that look nice.

Quitting all of these things made me more of a happy person and I appreciate life more. Im almost 22 and honestly... maybe I should've listened to my mom but my teenage self had other things in mind. 

Have a nice day everyone :D"
happy,"At 9:56 am today my boyfriend (m23) of 4 years and I (f21) both randomly  texted each other ""I love you ❤️"" while we were apart and it just made me smile. I was in my social work course watching a mock therapy group and one of the girls said her partner is her comfort person and I thought of him because he's mine. He told me that ""dreams"" by the cranberries was playing at his work (🥺) and it reminded him of me (omfg I'm winning). Life is funny and this just really reminded me that there are people who love you and think about you even when you're not around. "
happy,"It's been impossible for me (66F) to find anybody locally who knows enough about this to treat me, and the Mayo Clinic turned me down as a patient because I don't have the worse, more dangerous level of the disease, just the basic really shitty form of it.

I recently found out about Ketamine being used to treat chronic pain✅ trauma✅ depression✅ anxiety✅ *and this mast cell disease*✅, and five days ago I started on a daily microdose protocol. (The Ketamine works on the trauma *and* makes mast cells **calm TF down**, which helps the depression, anxiety, and pain, which will help calm down my nervous system, which will improve the mast cell symptoms, which include all of the above except the trauma.)

I didn't know what to expect because the disease makes my body think I'm allergic to virtually everything, but I haven't reacted noticeably to the drug at all. I haven't been optimistic at all about my future since my diagnosis, I'm so excited!"

happy,"I started a music project with two of my best friends a couple of years ago.  After releasing our first album I reached out to an author / reviewer to get feedback on what we'd put together.  I didn't get any feedback the first time around: this person was super busy so I didn't take any offence.  After releasing our second album I reached out again, still hopeful we'd get a listen.  It turns out this person liked our work quite a bit!  We got some very kind compliments.  I'm still smiling a day later. "
happy,"Hello everyone! If you look on my profile I’ve posted once a year about my weight loss. I started originally at 320 (although I was too embarrassed to admit it) and got to I think 250 before I got hurt, gained more weight, lost some. Now for 2023. Over the end of 2022 and into 2023 I let a coworker treat me to lunch every day. Where I ate a ton and really fell back into my old terrible habits and all that.
Since September something in me changed. (Also me and that coworker stopped talking, they were a terrible influence but I’m not go into that here) I have cut out most sugars and in general crappy food out. I usually eat one good meal a day. 
I originally started this just to lose weight out of embarrassment of how bad I had let myself go. Now, I just want to feel better. I’ve seen how much my diet change has improved how I feel and the lost weight helps a ton too. I feel so much better about myself. I just want to change now for the betterment of my health, now for how I look.
So here’s my post this year to keep myself accountable (and also people have said they wanted to see my updates as the years go on)
My end goal right now for this year is to be near 220, but I’d REALLY like to be under 200. So let’s see how 2024 will treat me and you and I hope we can accomplish our goals. If you made it this far reading, I thank you! See you next year!"
happy,"I love my profession but i absolutely hate my job and workplace for a number of reasons that I wont bother talking about. But today was one of those days that people just make me and my heart smile. At my PM shift today a man and two girls (they looked 4 and 6, I was not very sure) came into the pharmacy and handed me one prescription. The smaller one literally said “doctor, you’re so cute” (im not a doctor but i appreciated the compliment). Thought I heard her wrong so I told her to repeat herself and it made me really happy that I giggled under my mask and couldnt stop smiling. While they were waiting for their prescription filled, the older sister said it was cold and the younger offered her jacket and started taking it off and putting it on her which i thought was extremely sweet. They were sitting and talking, their dad just hugging them. When I finally dispensed her medications, the older one said “thank you, bye, cute doctor”. Their dad just laughed at the whole thing but I feel like I have to credit good parenting. This has to be the most wholesome interaction."
happy,"He moved around to get comfy and he laid his head on my hand like a pillow and he always comes to comfort me whenever I don’t feel well, I love him"
happy,"This is very small, but I haven't stopped thinking about it since it happened and it makes me happy! Sorry, this might get long.

I have a weird role at my job and it was created when I was hired so there were no processes or procedures in place. It's listed as a Customer Experience Specialist role, but I am involved in every aspect of the company. One thing that's evolved, that definitely wasn't part of the job, is that coworkers confide in me knowing I have a ""loose lips sink ships"" mentality. I never reveal details or gossip, but if I'm concerned about something/someone I'll roundabout bring it up to management. 

On Friday one of my direct teammates was venting pretty hard and I went to my manager to say I was concerned this person may be experiencing burnout and I'm not sure how long they'll be with the company.  My boss said he noticed it too and if they need to leave for their mental wellbeing it's understandable and there are contingency plans in place. Then he said, all except you, there's no contingency plan if we lose you. 

Folks, I know everyone is replaceable, but this made me feel so valued and seen. I already love my job, but this was icing on the cake. 

Thank you for reading. "
happy,"I know this sounds silly. 

But my friend is going through a bad divorce. He's been abused for 30 years by a wack job. He got kicked out of his place, and I offered my couch. 

We're sitting on my bed, watching a movie, and high. He has had a terrible day, so I'm trying to make it better. I noticed he took a picture of a gift I got him and posted it to a Reddit sub. 

I asked what he was doing, and he got so excited. He told me he was in this nice sub and everyone is so welcoming, that his post got 700 karma. He is very, very new to this app and is older, so he's not up to snuff with everything. 

But he just lit up when he showed me how excited he was that people were talking to him and that they liked his post so much that he got ""a little karma"" 

This man has cried his eyes out for hours tonight; seeing him beam about something so small just filled my heart. I'm overjoyed to see him this excited! 

Anyway, I just, really want this man to be happy, so for this small thing to really bring him joy just makes my chest burn.

Edit: 

If you all want to give him some love I'll link his art post. It'll make him very excited that people enjoy his art. He only ever shares it within his work space. Not sure why but I think it'll get him excited.

happy,"SO and I are gen x, come from suuuuuper broken homes. We met just over ten years ago, are celebrating our 9th wedding anniversary today. We’re having Jimmy John’s to celebrate while we save money for the move. 

He comes from the troubled teen industry, I come from your standard fucked up adolescence. 

We’ve been apartment dwellers since we met and have talked about a house but it had to be damn near perfect to make us commit. It was a long distance dream we clung to in our darkest hours. 

We found one.  Georgian Colonial, made from brick. It’s gonna last generations, like us. It has a small waterfall in the backyard, only a few neighbors, lots of trees and privacy. The Seller sat on the house until he found the “right” buyers and it turns out that was us. We got one hell of a deal. We’re paying less than half a mil for a house that’s worth 3/4 of a mil easily. 

We don’t feel like we deserve it but we’re damned if we won’t enjoy it. 

I’m a firm believer that the Universe gives you what you need. Not god, not fate, but something similar. I don’t know, but it seems like there was a time we needed something, and it’s been provided, and it’s not the first time. 

We needed a larger apartment? One was open in the same complex. We needed a family type car? First one we looked at was perfect. SO’s job sucked monkey balls? Here’s a random call about one and oh, hey, we’ll pay to interview and move you … 

We’re just so fucking happy right now and it sucks to share that with friends and family who aren’t necessarily feeling it. 

I wish I could share this feeling with all of you.

happy,"Workplace moment

I had a mentally bad morning after my birthday and was having a moment thinking about how certain people in my life would react if I wasn’t in this world (for context this doesn’t happen often and I am ok now).

When I came to work I turned the corner and my colleagues sang happy birthday and had a cake out for me. 

Fair to say my day went from 0-100 after that. It’s the little things that matters, even if you don’t ask if someone’s okay."

happy,"My mum has always been big into sewing and is much better at it than I am, I lost my quilt when I was 19 and we had a flood and it broke my heart because I was planning on passing it onto my daughter. But out of the blue this arrived. My daughter loves it and it's an absolutely gorgeous quilt. It looks like it took an insane amount of time (from all the different patches, edging and lining I'd estimate about 30 hours) and it's got a whole story that my mum wrote out by hand. The nostalgia, happiness at seeing my daughters joy and appreciation for the effort my mum went to for her granddaughter has made me the most proud and happy son/father "
happy,"So, as the title says, I started driving today. It was a motorcycle, no less. For some context, I'm 26 and never been in the driver's seat.

I've had Daisy (name of my bike) about as long as I've had a motorcycle license - about a year - but I haven't been able to put her on the road for various reasons, the funniest of which being the government and insurance companies typically don't like it when your 500lb death rocket was purchased with a lawn mower battery installed.

That's not all of it. Daisy needed a lot of work. But she finally met all the requirements to be put on the road just this morning, and I rode all day today. Let me tell you, it was worth every drop of sweat, every frustrated cuss, and of course every penny.

I knew driving would be fun, but I never could've predicted the extent of such. I was so calm just driving around my neighborhood. Everything could go wrong, and I knew it. But I didn't care. If it happens, I'll handle it like I was taught. All I could feel was joy."
happy,"So, my brother and I were walking to the store just to pick up some stuff. We got in and I went to the drinks section, to get a flavoured water. Some kid who looked a little older than us was half-way blocking the drink I needed to get (I don't care, I'm really patient), and when he noticed, immediately apologized and moved. I felt bad, I said ""no, it's alright!"", and he mumbled something inaudible to me afterwards, but smiled, so did I. 

My brother and I got our items, and were waiting in line. It was just the guy from the drinks section in front of us. He payed for his stuff, then handed a 10 dollar bill to the worker, and said, ""That's to pay for them"", pointing to us, whilst exiting the store. We thanked him, and he said ""You guys are nice"", and he was out of the store. It all happened really fast, but it paid for our stuff. We left and his dad or someone was already driving away. He waved, and we did too. It was just really sweet I thought. I hadn't had that happened to me before."

This has been the school of my dreams since I was a child, I grew up around it, supported the teams since I was a kid and always drove by it wanted to go to it. I got the acceptance letter today and started crying. Everything that has happened to me has lead to this point. The happiest moment of my life, if I can talk to my younger self who never believed she could end up here I would hug her. I can’t wait for this next step in my life."
happy,"I posted something in this sub a little less than 6 months ago after being clean for 2 weeks (I deleted the post for unrelated reasons) and while I got a lot of support I also got a lot of crap because it was ""only two weeks, come back when you have actually achieved something"".  Well, [here I am](http://imgur.com/gallery/ZDd7cMS), 6 months later, still clean, recently engaged, just got into a computer programming program, and have never been happier.  I just resolved my legal issues last week, actually have a savings of more than $2K, am rebuilding relationships with my family members and have nothing but optimism and hope for the future I never bothered to think about before.

Just wanted to use today to send out a PSA to anyone struggling with addiction - it can and DOES get better.  I am here for anyone that needs support.

Edit:  I honestly hate these types of edits but holy shit I worked a double yesterday and just woke up to this... You guys are amazing.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart. "
happy,"There isn’t much that brings me pleasure anymore but i am so grateful for warm blankets. I just put a blanket in the drier until it was warmed up, i took it out and laid under it for a few seconds and it was one of the most pleasurable things I have ever felt in my life. I just felt so safe, so comforted and loved and even though i was completely alone i didn’t feel like it at all. All of the tension in my body just completely went away and breathing became so easy, my lungs felt so open and every time i breathed i could feel my breath traveling throughout my whole body. The pleasurable sensation that started in my chest began to expand, until it expanded to the blanket itself. I didn’t even feel like a separate entity anymore, nothing was separate, all that exists is warmth, and every aspect of my surroundings including myself is a part of the Great Warmness. I was so affectionate i started smiling so intensely and i felt so happy i started crying in the middle of nowhere. It was beautiful. Why is a heated piece of cloth capable of this?? Even though it only lasts a few seconds, it makes everything around me seem perfect and it makes everything seem okay. It’s the only friend i have. I love the warmth of heated blankets so much and i am so thankful for its sweet embrace, i don’t deserve it at all"
happy,"Recently, I went to the movie theater with my kid, and while we were waiting for the movie to start, we played duck-catching. We were both thrilled to catch two of them, and I was delighted to capture this moment. I sincerely felt that happiness can be found in the simplest of things and tastes even better when the joy is shared with a loved one."
happy,"Tomorrow marks one whole month of not purging or throwing up, and recovering from my second bout with bulimia!!"
happy,"SO and I are gen x, come from suuuuuper broken homes. We met just over ten years ago, are celebrating our 9th wedding anniversary today. We’re having Jimmy John’s to celebrate while we save money for the move. 

He comes from the troubled teen industry, I come from your standard fucked up adolescence. 

We’ve been apartment dwellers since we met and have talked about a house but it had to be damn near perfect to make us commit. It was a long distance dream we clung to in our darkest hours. 

We found one.  Georgian Colonial, made from brick. It’s gonna last generations, like us. It has a small waterfall in the backyard, only a few neighbors, lots of trees and privacy. The Seller sat on the house until he found the “right” buyers and it turns out that was us. We got one hell of a deal. We’re paying less than half a mil for a house that’s worth 3/4 of a mil easily. 

We don’t feel like we deserve it but we’re damned if we won’t enjoy it. 

I’m a firm believer that the Universe gives you what you need. Not god, not fate, but something similar. I don’t know, but it seems like there was a time we needed something, and it’s been provided, and it’s not the first time. 

We needed a larger apartment? One was open in the same complex. We needed a family type car? First one we looked at was perfect. SO’s job sucked monkey balls? Here’s a random call about one and oh, hey, we’ll pay to interview and move you … 

We’re just so fucking happy right now and it sucks to share that with friends and family who aren’t necessarily feeling it. 

I wish I could share this feeling with all of you.

happy,"I'm 28 years old. I graduated high school early and expectations were high for me even though I lived in a toxic sometimes abusive household. I worked in a restaurant to claw myself out of the gutter, and ended up with pretty severe addiction problems. Over 2 years ago I decided I wanted to break the cycle of mental illness and addiction in my family. I wanted to work on my mental health, but I knew that meant recovery. I went to treatment, found a form of therapy that worked for me and after 2 years of individual with a year of group therapy in there I have evolved! Not only did I get a day job that I love and feel valued at, but I also began school in January! My first term just ended, and I got A's in my two classes! And I got 100% in my favorite class of all time!! A good friend of mine went to some nice schools in the area but he's been beyond supportive throughout my journey so I texted him about school and that was his response. I'm so blessed. Good friends, just got a raise and more hours at my day job, we have partial custody over my step son, and I'm doing great mentally and emotionally on top of it all! IF I CAN DO IT YOU CAN DO IT TOO! LOVE YOU ALL TGIF I GET TO SAY THAT NOW AFTER QUITTING THE RESTAURANT LIFE IT KEEPS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER YALL XOXOXOXOXOX"
happy,"Poor thing was almost dried up. I put it in my houseplant, watered it, and stuck some dead leaves in the pot. Looking a little more closely at the pictures, I could’ve nursed it a little longer (was worried the pot was too small for it), but I tried my best. I didn’t see it at the time. Nonetheless, I am so glad it’s alive and better!
Wanted to share our little victory with someone🪱"
happy,"I was tired of my life. I woke up one day and realized I have been “winging” it and “half-assing” through life. I’m not in a terrible place. I have a decent paying management job in infrastructure. But this wasn’t the life young me wanted.

I got accepted in college and I’m about to start classes. I scored insanely well on the accuplacer (after countless hours studying). And the end goal is to finally pursue my dream and become a lawyer. It was my dream all as a child. But I spent too much time in high school skipping class and hitting the reefer. I graduated high school with a 2.0 GPA. I didn’t even understand math at all. I had Fs in every math class. But I self taught my self advance algebra and statistics in a matter of weeks before my test. And I’m so proud of that. (I was proud when I was doing 7th grade math test and passing lol) 

I’m sharing on here because I’m divorced and kinda alone. No one is by my side to share the joy with me. And all my coworkers laughed at me and one of my coworkers (who dropped out in 7th grade) keeps telling me how dumb I am for doing it. I just wanted to get it off my chest in a safe area because I’m genuinely stoked. 

This is a massive vent and humble brag. "

happy,"First there's A, she's been my number one bestie since we were 7! Me and her get together to watch bullshit reality TV and talk major shit about the men. She loves videogames and she 100% completed breath of the wild and working her way through the new one. She loves her younger brother and takes him on as many vacations as she can. She puts together the most perfect for you, beautiful thoughtful gifts which she presents for you artfully. She has a talent at art and also interior design and her place is stylishly decorated and immaculately clean. Her passion lies in the Library though and she's almost finished with her masters in library science while working full time as a receptionist but soon she'll be a librarian. She's also super fucking funny. When we get together it's allllways laughing.

Then there's B, she's only like a genius scientist and professor with a perfect SAT score who just landed a job at NASA working from home. ALSO she runs marathons even though she got long COVID and has heart problems now. Her goal is still to run in every state and she's still working her way through it. She also skiis, roller skates, rock climbs, and has completed iron man triathlons. On top of that she can also draw and recently she made her own stickers of famous rock formations (shes a geologist). She's the most emotionally intelligent human I know and crafts everything she says with the most delicate tactful gentle thoughtfulness without sugarcoating anything and tells you things to challenge your ideas and potentially harmful or toxic thought processes. She is also a good baker and sends me cookies in the mail a lot!

Then there's C, he's probably the most interesting dude I know although it took him two years of talking to me every day to actually open up about the history of his life. He's been to jail a few times for various things and he told me all about the people there and most of them were ok guys who just ran amock and got themselves in trouble (except for theives who were all around no good people) he's been a chef in fancy restaurants but he is keen on languages and very knowledgeable about them particularly those from the middle east. He originally wanted to be an academic until life took a turn. When he was younger he did martial arts, tended to carnivorous plants, was part of the orchid society, and went out into the wilderness to hunt rocks a lot. He got into bad accidents and was badly injured so now he can't really do the stuff he used to love. It makes me sad. But he's super funny in the most imaginative quirky way. And no one has ever made me laugh in quite the same way.

Then there's well, the other C. He's a young thing. He's a bright person with a promising future. He's in medical school studying to be a surgeon and he's recently gotten his masters degree in the top of his class. He loves videogames and he's quiet, reserved, values manners but he's not afraid of dancing. He loves a good party and night out. When I went to the uk and visited him, he showed me some of the castles in Wales of which he is very proud. He has a strong sense of patriotism about being Welsh. He is the most different from me of all of my friends from two totally different upbringings and worlds but somehow we never run out of things to talk about. When I get in my dramatic moods, He has a way of saying just the perfect matter of fact thing to drop me down to earth and I laugh as I fall. He is a complete nerd to the core but he has a little bit of a charming cockiness and confidence that makes me love the hell out of him.

I have a bunch more friends but if I told you about them all then this would be insanely long! So I just talk about the closest ones. "

happy,"everyday can be a chance to start over is the what i think about each day i wake up and get out of bed. i want to hear your story and what you either think, or do to stay happy and not let bad thoughts ruin the start of your day!"
happy,"So I’m 17 and an engineering intern. I started last year mid-February and it’s been going pretty good. At Christmas, I got a $330 bonus ($200 after taxes) and I was super happy with that. Today, my boss stopped by my office and said they usually give out year end bonuses but their system wasn’t working right this year so it was a bit late. He said to remember that I’m only really part time and when I said I appreciate it no matter what he said “it’s better than a stick in the eye”. 

So after he said that, I thought it was gonna be like $100 max right, but I open it and see ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS!! It’s $640 after taxes and I know that isn’t a ton to some people BUT I AM SUPER HAPPY. And yesterday I found out I’m getting $1500 back in taxes so I am going to be absolutely ballin!!!! HELL YEAH!!!"
happy,"I've been so depressed the last few months because of an incident I don't want to go into. Its been a long time since I've felt genuine happiness but today is just the perfect day. I feel so relaxed, as if all my problems just went away. There's a really nice sunset out (if only there was a few extra degrees so I could sit out on my balcony), and I'm listening to my favorite tracks on my phone. Usually those things are more of a treatment, but today its a cure. 








I feel free for the first time in so long. I wish this feeling on everyone"
happy,"Just remember guys there are good things and people in the world, you just gotta find them :) thank you couple wherever you are now!"
happy,"I haven't had sushi in about 3-4 weeks. That changed when my parents surprised me with sushi! I was in the middle of an online class when my mom walked in (I had the camera and microphone turned off) and gave me two pieces of sushi. When I took the first bite of that first piece of sushi, it REALLY hit the spot. It just felt soooo satisfying and soooo delicious when I took that first bite. When I took that first bite, I felt that amazing feeling when you taste sushi for the first time and end up loving it so much that it becomes your favorite food. I've never felt this satisfaction and fulfillment like any other when satisfying a sushi craving like this particular moment.

I'm pretty sure that this is what a foodgasm feels like, cause I don't think I've ever felt this before when eating food, let alone trying certain foods for the first time.

I don't know if there are any more words I could use to describe this feeling."
happy,"So I've worked for getting on 6 years now 

Been senior support for about 3-4 years. Which involves working 24 hour shifts 

For the last year or so I've been doing a lot of the manager work without the extra pay, this is because the current deputy was not really able to do the tasks 

Well I was having a bit of a moan over the Easter bank holidays because I had finished three 24 hour shifts when the regional manager started sending me a series of tasks for some reason (my bosses boss) and I did it all promptly while moaning at myself for being a push over 

Turns out the regional manager then asked my boss why I'm not the deputy as I seem better for the role.

This lead to a discussion with the current deputy who said that she is more than happy to step down from the position for me to take over 


So I'm happy to have gotten recognition from someone high up the chain but also I will now only be working one 24 hour shift a week and will have 16 hours office hours throughout the week 

Also I still get a pay rise of course aha "
happy,You can do it too!!!
happy,I absolutely love pineapple and strawberries! I buy them precut because it’s time consuming but one day I was rambling with my mom complaining about how expensive it is to buy precut fruits so she took it upon herself to buy some pineapples and cut them up and wash the strawberries! ☺️ I’ll finish them in like 2 days lol
happy,"My son loves to play outside. The house next to us is being rebuilt so it is unoccupied at the moment. There is a small pond located on the property so every now and then we venture over there to see what sort of wildlife we can spot. Yesterday, disappointment struck when we arrived to the pond and didn’t spot any animals. Normally there’s at least a few ducks, but not today. After about 10 minutes he looked down at the ground, picked up a very high-quality stick, and threw it into the water. The stick struck the water. The splash made him so happy he exclaimed, “I did it dada, I did it.” It took me a second but then I realized, wow he is so happy because of the stick hitting the water! Mind you, I have never thrown anything into this pond before, so this was just his primal instinct telling him “pick up stick, throw stick water, stick make splash, make boy happy”… anyways I thought I’d share this because it was enough to make a grown-man cry. Such simple acts can bring so much joy. We’re such simple creatures haha. Have a great day everyone

happy,"I’m going with 2 of my close girl friends. I’ve done cruises with family before but I’ve never traveled as an adult, both in the US and internationally,  without family (parents) or husband. Now I’m 31, divorced, just got out of an awful relationship, and i am SO excited for these next adventures. I’m going to see some BEAUTIFUL places, learn fascinating history, drink, laugh, meet new people, and I can hardly wait. 

I’ve been through a pretty wild ride the last several years and I just feel like I am in a really good place. I have good friends, good family, a job I love that pays the bills, and I am able to do things like get a Disneyland pass and travel to new places. I am so happy and grateful to be where I am in life and I hope everyone finds this level of contentment ❤️"
happy,"I went to bed sad and preoccupied, I woke up groggy and then... 

Then I went to see my freshly repoted baby tomatoes, some of them grew a third cute leaf when I thought I fucked it all up ! New leaves on my plants (I'm a young plant parent, 20 plants besides the vegetables) give me hope, it's like starting anew, being reborn... 

What is the thing that made You smile today?"
happy,"Exactly as the title states, I'm just really happy that things I used to dream about are actually becoming a reality!! I'm also so grateful to be in a position to make it happen. Just wanted to share :)"
happy,I can’t even describe this. I feel so light and nice and light and my head is spinning 
happy,"For context I’ve always wanted to do content creation like YouTube and streaming mainly streaming and I finally have started officially 30 days ago streaming everyday. This past 30 days have been the most motivated and passionate I’ve felt about anything I’ve ever done and truly feels good to know I finally have atleast tried. I couldn’t have forgiven myself for never atleast trying it and I guess now I can say I did. If anyone ever sees this whatever you are afraid to do, please don’t be and just do it. Do what you love because that’s what matters. I think a quote that randomly connects with this sentiment is one by Jim Carrey. summed up he pretty much said if you can fail at what you hate doing why not take the risk at what you love doing because atleast you are happy.

happy,I just feel so much better now that I've learned to cope with all of my mental health issues and even though is not perfect I just feel so proud of myself :))
happy,"Most of my life I've had little to no self esteem. I've always thought little of myself. Little to the point I settled for people, things and situations that I didn't deserve. For the last year I've been working on me. I started exercising and I've lost weight, I've grown in my faith, I've even started expanding my mind trying to learn new things, for example I've been studying German for a year for fun. Today I realized I'm not a bad guy and I have a lot of good to offer others and my self image has drastically improved. For the forst time I'm getting some self esteem and I'm starting to like myself which I never have. I just felt like sharing this."

happy,"We've only been dating for a few weeks now, but she is incredibly thoughtful--she made soup and dropped it off for me when I got covid over the holidays, we've made each other playlists and I am enthralled by the one she made me, she sends me really sweet voice messages when she wakes up and before she goes to bed, she says incredibly sweet, silly, and romantic things that make me blush for days at a time. I have never felt so safe and held and seen and attracted to someone all at once so quickly before. She is really forthright and curious and has a lot of integrity. I admire her a great deal and feel so lucky to be able to see who she is becoming (she is trans and has been honoring herself in some pretty big ways lately and witnessing that from the sidelines has been really beautiful and touching). I am not sure how long we'll be together but for now I am very grateful she is in my life. "
happy,"IM GONNA HAVE A FEAST

happy,"I’m so excited. This is a job I’ve wanted for ages and I feel like people take me seriously and respect me professionally, which I’ve never really experienced as I’m still 20 and in college. 

I get to go to a new city I’ve never seen before, go to fancy dinners every night and get paid for it!! Also I feel like I’ve made my dad proud of me so that’s an added bonus. "
happy,Back from a deployment and finally got to take my mom out for a birthday celebration. Long overdue.
happy,"

My professor had embarrassed me in front of the whole class because I did not know one answer. He started asking me my name and throwing comments about how I don't know anything and all. He made me stand in front of everyone. Nevertheless, I, someone who's suffering from anxiety disorder and severe anxiety, someone who gets embarrassed so very easily, for the first time, did not get embarrassed. 

I was pretty chill tbh. I did not have a raised heartbeat, I did not feel extremely sad, I did not panic, I might have had a few tics but that's it. After he left, I just went about doing my job and honestly I was impressed with myself. Idk whether this happended because I have a bigger embarrassing situation/trauma to deal with such that this felt so small or because I was already tired of everyone's sh!t. 

It happened and I'm honestly kinda happy."

I am so excited to share that I was finally able to mow my lawn, rake my leaves, and plant a few seeds in my yard today! Some backstory (trigger warning: SA), I was sexually assaulted by a man that lived on my street, and for the longest time, I was nervous to work on my yard in my front lawn because I did not want to see him. But, he finally moved out. I was so excited to see the moving truck near his house.

So, here's how the conversation went: we were walking out of class together, it's the last day of the semester before I can't see him again, and we had this activity where we needed to compliment someone about them. 

We were walking out of class, and I told him: your smile is so, so contagious, Annd immediately he smiles incredibly wide at me, his two small dimples on the sides of his lips show, and it was the cutest thing ever, and super rewarding. Then we walk past a classroom with his friend in it, which he interrupts me, but my crush goes:

""SHUT UP, she's SPEAKING. Continue, please, continue."" So I do, but I tell him that.""Yeah, yeah, I know I'm boosting your ego, but it's like- actually super amazing, and..."" To which my face is pratically melting off, which he points out, telling me my cheeks are beet red.
Then says: 

""It's kinda hot, ngl"" I wasn't sure whether he said, ""Your face is super hot red,"" I was too dizzy from the amount of blush on my face. 

Then I told him it was just adorable and how I was gonna miss it. He's full-on grinning now before he begins to leave. AHHHHHHHHHG"
happy,"Undergraduate Completion

This story is about my journey as a college student and the joy I have at its completion.

I started my 5-year undergraduate degree in accounting during the fall of 2018. The first year was pure bliss; I gained so many friends, lost my virginity, felt heartbreak, expanded my understanding of the world and came to love diversity. I had earned a position as an RA for my sophomore year with one of my new, and still, great friends. 

Fall of 2019 started as the Residential Department put it, ""Gaining 60 new contracted friends"". I put my life into creating the best experience for both my residents and myself. Come March of 2020, this was shattered. COVID-19 officially shut down my campus and everyone was sent home. Uncertainty of the next year lasted until summer when our accepted return was announced. With many new rules and being shipped off into a different housing area, I was apprehensive to say the least. 

Fall of 2020 was the beginning of my hidden, yet sharp, mental decline. It is here my met my most sincere and closest friends beyond my home as well. The seclusion was otherwise agonizing and I had turned to drinking on the weekends with a small group of friends for the majority of the college year.  By summer of 2021, I had landed an internship in my field of study, entered a relationship, and received a promotion from RA to CA. The internship was phenomenal and the relationship amazing, though I found myself constantly crying and was put on am anti-depressant as depression runs in my family.

Fall of 2021, I was now entering the depths of my studies, additional responsibilities from my position, and my s/o was now 2 hours away. The anti-depressants dramatically worsened my mentality and became secluded from my studies, relationship, and job all at once. I dropped 2 classes in an attempt to reduce the load, to no avail. By winter of 2022, the relationship had ended in pain from depression+guilt and my education and job faltered further. I stepped down from my role as a CA to RA and took fewer classes to start the next year. Summer of 2022 was jobless in an attempt to regain my mental fortitude. 

Fall of 2022 did not last long. Immediately I was shunted into the same routine of depressive behavior, this time accompanied by suicidal ideation. As I was failing every class and effectively not working as is, I dropped out of college just before Thanksgiving to live at home and continue online next semester. Spring of 2023 I had begun seeing a psychiatrist as well as therapist weekly. My class load was very light as I was surely going to need an extra year to graduate. I tried new medications bi-monthly and my therapist was unhelpful for myself. I completed some summer courses but sank deeper and deeper in depression. 

Fall of 2023 was the worst time of my 24 years of existence thus far. Although my course load was still light, I had no point in living. I was divising painless ways to commit suicide and preserve my body for my family. I was ready to die when I started a new medication (Cymbalta) and started seeing a new therapist.

My life changed.

This medication with a dedicated therapist who cared about me and my wellbeing rocketed me out of the 6-foot hole. Within 3 months of dedicated medication rigorous therapy, I had finally stopped my suicidal ideation. Winter of 2024 was the first time I felt alive in almost 3 years. I felt pure happiness again for the first time 1 month ago. I am alive again.

As of May 11, 2024, I have walked across the stage, accepted my diploma for accounting, and am *effectively* depression free. I breathe as this chapter is completed. I felt the sun of my skin today, felt what it is like to be human. What it is like to be alive. 

I wanted to share this joy with others in hopes to encourage growth and foster hope. I am alive and far beyond well as I work to create the best me I can for the world.

happy,"I've got some body image issues, depression, and all the other things we all deal with and when I'm feeling low I find post matching my mood and give the positive advice I wish someone would lay down on me, hoping it helps.

Today I responded to one and they dm'd me back and said thanks and even went through a couple of my old post and gave me some advice...how great.

Have a great day everyone, spread the love!"

happy,"I haven't had sushi in about 3-4 weeks. That changed when my parents surprised me with sushi! I was in the middle of an online class when my mom walked in (I had the camera and microphone turned off) and gave me two pieces of sushi. When I took the first bite of that first piece of sushi, it REALLY hit the spot. It just felt soooo satisfying and soooo delicious when I took that first bite. When I took that first bite, I felt that amazing feeling when you taste sushi for the first time and end up loving it so much that it becomes your favorite food. I've never felt this satisfaction and fulfillment like any other when satisfying a sushi craving like this particular moment.

I'm pretty sure that this is what a foodgasm feels like, cause I don't think I've ever felt this before when eating food, let alone trying certain foods for the first time.

I don't know if there are any more words I could use to describe this feeling."
happy,"My mum has always been big into sewing and is much better at it than I am, I lost my quilt when I was 19 and we had a flood and it broke my heart because I was planning on passing it onto my daughter. But out of the blue this arrived. My daughter loves it and it's an absolutely gorgeous quilt. It looks like it took an insane amount of time (from all the different patches, edging and lining I'd estimate about 30 hours) and it's got a whole story that my mum wrote out by hand. The nostalgia, happiness at seeing my daughters joy and appreciation for the effort my mum went to for her granddaughter has made me the most proud and happy son/father "

happy,"I remember getting a notif, looking at my phone, then freaking my family out cuz I just suddenly started jumping up and down yelling 12 DOLLARS! 12 DOLLARS! 😂

I really came a long way with working on music, putting my heart into beats just to make people dance and forget about whatever troubles them, so seeing people begin to support me made me feel happy beyond words.

Finally I can consider myself an actual artist, not just a hobbyist making music for fun, but an actual artist that was capable of inspiring others.

I never thought I'd make it to this point, I know it's a very small win, but its the first step towards many other milestones yet to come.

I have many people to thank, the yt community and soundcloud, but I think Id be years behind if it werent for niche communities on reddit supporting me all the way through.

Its only January and it's already a big year for me ❤️"

happy,"Quit my job

Recently quit my full time job. Was a good position and good pay but my manager went behind my back and basically just gave my position away and expected me to take the demotion purely because she was struggling at the other location and needed me back there to help. It was nothing to do with me or my work as I was really good at my job (don't mean to be bigheaded) but she allowed this other lady to introduce herself to all my colleagues as the manager of my location when they all know that i was there. 
I was really upset because it made it look like it was because I couldn't do my job and she completely broke any trust I had for her. I loved my job and I'm pretty upset BUT I stood up for myself and didn't stand for the lack of respect and told her where to go. I'm proud of myself for doing so and happy I'm no longer working under her. I'm confident I'll get a good job again that gives me the respect and decency I'm owed.

Just needed a lil rant lol don't mind me"
happy,"I've been playing as a non-singing guitarist
in rock bands for a long time and finally started taking singing lessons 2 months ago to boost my confidence.

My wife has heard me sing plenty at home in private and has always given that supportive, but vague, ""yah, you sound OK"" response.

My instructor said I really had to own and believe in the lyrics of the songs I sing, so l've been working on singing with more feeling and expression.

We've been together for more than 30 years and I'm still crazy about her.

This morning I was hugging my wife, and while looking in her eyes, I started singing her the Beatles version of ""Til There Was You""...and she got quiet with watery eyes and a beet red face!  Then we burst out laughing.

My voice may not be perfect and I may be an old, but maybe I still got it!😻"
happy,"Basically the title but my mum recently bought us tickets to see Hozier when he comes to Australia and she’s now teaching herself the lyrics to all his songs so she can sing along, what makes this better is that English is not her first language and she keeps asking me what some words mean so she can fully understand what his songs are about."
happy,"

My professor had embarrassed me in front of the whole class because I did not know one answer. He started asking me my name and throwing comments about how I don't know anything and all. He made me stand in front of everyone. Nevertheless, I, someone who's suffering from anxiety disorder and severe anxiety, someone who gets embarrassed so very easily, for the first time, did not get embarrassed. 

I was pretty chill tbh. I did not have a raised heartbeat, I did not feel extremely sad, I did not panic, I might have had a few tics but that's it. After he left, I just went about doing my job and honestly I was impressed with myself. Idk whether this happended because I have a bigger embarrassing situation/trauma to deal with such that this felt so small or because I was already tired of everyone's sh!t. 

It happened and I'm honestly kinda happy."
happy,"Hi everyone!

So my girlfriend and I (both women <3 if that's an issue for you, please just don't interact with this post) started dating at the end of January this year. This was after my ex-boyfriend and I broke up a few weeks before (we were together 4 years but it had been over a year that it wasn't working out. I don't want comments on this, you'll understand why later).

I have a lot of anxiety around relationships. My ex verbally abused me for the first part of our relationship, and then he was never physically there because he had to stay back home for understandable reasons. I was unhappy. I did things that hurt him too, and I've looked into why I did what I did and am learning to overcome what happened between us (the things he used to say to me in anger outbursts).

Now I've been friends with my girlfriend for 3 ish years now. I always thought she was so gorgeous and funny. I got to spending more time with her and next thing I knew, I was falling in love. I don't know what I did to get so lucky. Whenever I come forward about my feelings about something, she NEVER gets mad at me. She's so calm, so chill. She reassures me gently, and listens to me while explaining to me why this is okay, that I am valid. When I'm down for whatever reason, she makes me laugh without a problem. I can do anything with her and we can make it fun! I laugh harder with her than anyone else. She engages in things that I like and genuinely enjoys them, and vice versa.

The other day, we were snuggling and chatting in bed. I don't remember what she said, but it really hit home and I just felt my eyes start to water. She asked me what was wrong, and I just looked at her and said ""I just realized how unsafe I felt in the world before you"". She smiled and pulled me in, she let me cry on her for a few seconds.

She lets me talk about my ex and what happened. She knows I'm far from romantically or sexually interested in him anymore. She's so kind about the fact that I do miss him sometimes as a friend (I mean, 4 years with someone and talking almost every day is hard to let go of). I don't think about it often, really. She lets me talk about the things he did/said to me that hurt me deeply. I mean even yesterday we were talking about some of the horrible things he said and she looked at me and said ""I want to show you what a soft love looks like."" I just stared at her in awe and shock. I was frozen in place, just...speechless. She makes it safe for me to express excitement about things I love, she doesn't judge me for the things I enjoy, and SHE DOESN'T GET MAD AT ME!!! She doesn't insult me beyond what we both agree are jokes, she gently redirects me towards healthier behaviors for my mental health and for the relationship, we're both working together to be healthy and I just...wow....She's even coming home with me for Easter weekend (we don't celebrate but hey, why not).

I'm beyond happy with her. Maybe it's too soon to tell, I don't know, but I want to marry her someday. I really think this is it, that she's my future wife. She's currently asleep in my bed. I want her to be my love for the rest of our lives. She is truly and unequivocally the most beautiful person I've ever met (inside and out). I can't see a day where I don't find her funny anymore, where I don't find her attractive anymore, where I don't want to run to her to tell her about my day. I want to share my world with her. She's my best friend and more. I've never been happier, and I've never felt more like me.

If you read this whole thing, thank you so much :) I know it's a lot, it's messy, and honestly I can't even say everything I feel about this woman because I just don't have the words to express the deep, honest love I have for her. I wish you all the most WONDERFUL day!"
happy,Recently I've been looking for a new drill and I went to a hardware store and saw all of the drills where 100-200 bucks!

happy,"Undergraduate Completion

This story is about my journey as a college student and the joy I have at its completion.

I started my 5-year undergraduate degree in accounting during the fall of 2018. The first year was pure bliss; I gained so many friends, lost my virginity, felt heartbreak, expanded my understanding of the world and came to love diversity. I had earned a position as an RA for my sophomore year with one of my new, and still, great friends. 

Fall of 2019 started as the Residential Department put it, ""Gaining 60 new contracted friends"". I put my life into creating the best experience for both my residents and myself. Come March of 2020, this was shattered. COVID-19 officially shut down my campus and everyone was sent home. Uncertainty of the next year lasted until summer when our accepted return was announced. With many new rules and being shipped off into a different housing area, I was apprehensive to say the least. 

Fall of 2020 was the beginning of my hidden, yet sharp, mental decline. It is here my met my most sincere and closest friends beyond my home as well. The seclusion was otherwise agonizing and I had turned to drinking on the weekends with a small group of friends for the majority of the college year.  By summer of 2021, I had landed an internship in my field of study, entered a relationship, and received a promotion from RA to CA. The internship was phenomenal and the relationship amazing, though I found myself constantly crying and was put on am anti-depressant as depression runs in my family.

Fall of 2021, I was now entering the depths of my studies, additional responsibilities from my position, and my s/o was now 2 hours away. The anti-depressants dramatically worsened my mentality and became secluded from my studies, relationship, and job all at once. I dropped 2 classes in an attempt to reduce the load, to no avail. By winter of 2022, the relationship had ended in pain from depression+guilt and my education and job faltered further. I stepped down from my role as a CA to RA and took fewer classes to start the next year. Summer of 2022 was jobless in an attempt to regain my mental fortitude. 

Fall of 2022 did not last long. Immediately I was shunted into the same routine of depressive behavior, this time accompanied by suicidal ideation. As I was failing every class and effectively not working as is, I dropped out of college just before Thanksgiving to live at home and continue online next semester. Spring of 2023 I had begun seeing a psychiatrist as well as therapist weekly. My class load was very light as I was surely going to need an extra year to graduate. I tried new medications bi-monthly and my therapist was unhelpful for myself. I completed some summer courses but sank deeper and deeper in depression. 

Fall of 2023 was the worst time of my 24 years of existence thus far. Although my course load was still light, I had no point in living. I was divising painless ways to commit suicide and preserve my body for my family. I was ready to die when I started a new medication (Cymbalta) and started seeing a new therapist.

My life changed.

This medication with a dedicated therapist who cared about me and my wellbeing rocketed me out of the 6-foot hole. Within 3 months of dedicated medication rigorous therapy, I had finally stopped my suicidal ideation. Winter of 2024 was the first time I felt alive in almost 3 years. I felt pure happiness again for the first time 1 month ago. I am alive again.

As of May 11, 2024, I have walked across the stage, accepted my diploma for accounting, and am *effectively* depression free. I breathe as this chapter is completed. I felt the sun of my skin today, felt what it is like to be human. What it is like to be alive.

After months of waiting, many tests, background checks and a fun 4 hour long psych eval with even more tests involved…

This is fantastic news!!!!"
happy,"My birthday was the 27th and I received money for letting me buy supplies to try sculpting for the first time. I went to Micheal’s and got everything I needed! The wonderful cashier gave me a discount and I was able to add a few more things I’d been eyeing! 

I drew ideas for figurines ages ago and I finally get to turn one of them into a reality!! This is my progress so far! I’ve never sculpted clay before but I have done some models on ZBrush and watched a few tutorials on working the clay, so I had an idea of how things were going to go. I’m doing piece by piece and then putting them all together at the end. I plan to paint and varnish it as well!! 

I’ve had a lot of fun so far and I’m really excited to finish it!!"
happy,"I'm so happy seeing her cuddled up in her old bunk bed this morning, we did something right huh? She still wants to be around us lol. "
happy,"As an artist, I’ve never been as prolific as I have been this year and even though I beat myself up about it, it’s amazing to think back on the year about ALL the paintings I have done. I’ve probably done over twenty or thirty paintings this year of varying sizes and this was after YEARS of doing maybe just less than a handful. I think last year I did two or three. Prior to this year I was making friends who didn’t even know I was a painter or went to school for art. I’m proud to say that narrative has vastly shifted! I’m so proud of myself for painting more even though it’s really hard to get started some days."
happy,"I (30f) have been married to my wonderful husband for 4yrs and we dated for 2 before getting married. My in-laws have been wonderful to me the entire time. My FIL is like a second father and my MIL is like the mother I never had. Through the duration of my relationship with my husband, I have also been helping him heal his relationship with his parents, i.e making sure boundaries are maintained and communication lines remain open and honest whilst still being kind and considerate. 

My father suddenly passed away about a month ago and it's been really difficult as it was very unexpected but my husband, my friends and my inlaws have really rallied around and made sure I am okay. I've spoken to my husband and my inlaws and it has been decided that they will move in with us into my father's house to 1: help us with some bills and maintaining my father's property and 2: help them because they do not own the place they live now and will need some help as they are getting closer to retirement age. 

My FIL is disabled and on SSA benefits. I am also trying to get disability as I have not been able to work in almost 2 years due to a variety of health issues. My FIL has been so understanding and helpful with tips and tricks on how to do things around the house while chronically in pain or what processes are helpful in going through the disability thing. My MIL has been a real trooper through all of this and has helped keep me grounded as well. My husband is actually excited to live with his parents again because while I understand that his relationship with his parents is completely different than what I had with my dad, I don't want him to go through what I'm going through with any regrets and such. 

It just feels like a spotlight in a very dark time and I really love my husband and my in-laws. Even my brother in-law and future sister-in-law have been super amazing and accommodating and kind. I really love the family I married into and l hope they know I love them too."
happy,"So for the past 3 months I’ve been managing the little money I had since work stopped paying us but it wasn’t just my office apparently it was the whole country like everyone working under the government wasn’t getting paid or isn’t getting paid let me say it was just a week  ago my sister even said they paid them but other offices not yet. Eventually my money finished and I ended with things I needed to do but had no money and worst of all a few days ago my cousin kept bugging me about a money I owed her this really made me so worried because I hate owing people money and hate people thinking I’m deliberately refusing to pay them but I really didn’t have the money 

I even cried because it’s not like I could borrow from someone else to pay her because no one ever believes me when I say I’m broke they just think I want to get more money or they think she is from a rich family her parents definitely give her money whenever she wants. They don’t, my parents have never believed in giving their kids everything, I mean they give other peoples kids everything but not theirs so I guess everyone would think they treat us the same way but it’s not like that 

Anyways today my mom called and said hey I sent you some money and the first thing I said what do you need me to get for you or pay or who should I send it to because that usually it and she said no it’s for you. For a second I thought she was joking and I was like what did you say I should do with this money, and she said it’s for you. I was so happy I wanted to cry. So I asked can I really use this money and she goes yes. I don’t know how she knew I needed money so badly because I didn’t tell anyone but I guess she could tell since she is my mom and I love her so much. Though it didn’t solve all my problems it solved the one I was most worried about it. My mom didn’t need to send me the money but she did and I’m so grateful for that

Update: I got paid today finally 😊. Thanks for the sweet comments my mom really is a great mom. I feel like her sending me that money had something to do with me finally getting paid after 3 months. Maybe a coincidence or something I don’t know but I just want to believe that. Though I only got paid for one month it’s still better than nothing "

happy,"
He is the strongest man I have ever met, I admire and look up to him more than he knows. We passed our one year recently and my love for him still grows day by day. The world seems so colorful with meaning falling out of every single fold and crevice. Everything has meaning. Every little bug exists at the same time as we do. As incoherent as it is, I even find joy in realizing we both have eyes to look at the same things together. We are under the same sky. Somehow these axioms of the human experience feel much more meaningful because he’s alive with me. If I had killed myself when I was 17 I would have never known he was out there in this very world that I am in. Living his little 17 year old life, experiencing things that would make him the man he is today. I sometimes wish we would have met as babies. I would’ve loved him when we were 10, 15, 20, just as much as I love him at 24. I think that’s what love is.

happy,"Today marks 1 year of not experiencing a panic attack. 🥹 Mine were severe - included vomiting, heart irregularities, tremors, sweating, a fleeting feeling, and occasionally paralysis. I felt as though I would never be free of these, until I moved and surrounded myself with lovely, caring individuals. I have not had one since and I want to jump around in happiness. My mental health was declining a few years back and now I feel like it might be at its positive peak which I’m eternally grateful for. This past week especially I’ve felt an overwhelming sense of peace. Just wanted to post in case anyone else is suffering, I still get anxiety but from all the work ive done and being in the right place has helped so much and the anxiety is very minor. 🙌🏼💕"

happy,"I'm solo traveling at the moment and I've had the realisation that I'm a completely different person than I was when I was younger (I'm 32 now). I remember back then I was so insecure and I dealt with crippling anxiety. I was so self aware and ashamed of myself that I had to mentally prepare myself to do grocery shopping because I was so afraid that people would judge me. I've never been conventionally attractive, but back then I was convinced I I was absolutely hideous and I didn't deserve good things. I feel so sorry for my younger self. Now I don't give a crap about what people think of me, I've accepted myself for who I am and find beauty in small things. Sometimes I still struggle with my appearance, but not in the self destructive way as I did ten years ago.I try to always be kind to myself and treat myself how I treat good friends. At the moment I'm doing whatever I want whenever I want, all the choices I make, I make for me. It is so freeing. I feel so much love for myself, ny life, my friends and family, my work.
God I love solo traveling."
happy,"I'm working on this AI chatbot app for a college project, and yesterday I encountered some errors causing the whole app to stop functioning and with the submission deadline just days away, I was freaking out. I've spent the last two days trying every fix I could think of but nothing worked. I was honestly starting to lose hope that I'd be able to get this thing running again in time.

This morning, I posted about the issue on a tech forum, desperate for any help I could get. That's when this dude reached out - he'd dealt with a similar error before and offered to walk me through solving it. He spends like 4-5 hours meticulous hours going through my code until we finally isolate and fix the bug. The guy even shared some of his own confidential API keys with me, just to ensure my app could run properly.

A total stranger devoting half his day to helping a random guy on the internet get unstuck. He's got his own shit to worry about, but he still took the time and made the effort, simply out of the goodness of his heart. We're from completely different countries, he doesn't know anything about me , but he came through in the clutch.

It's easy to think the internet is just a cesspool, but then you connect with someone who reminds you that good people are out there. You just have to be lucky enough to find them every once in a while. Somehow I managed to cross paths with this generous soul and now we're internet buddies. It's small acts of kindness like that which restores your faith in humanity. "
happy,"We've only been dating for a few weeks now, but she is incredibly thoughtful--she made soup and dropped it off for me when I got covid over the holidays, we've made each other playlists and I am enthralled by the one she made me, she sends me really sweet voice messages when she wakes up and before she goes to bed, she says incredibly sweet, silly, and romantic things that make me blush for days at a time. I have never felt so safe and held and seen and attracted to someone all at once so quickly before. She is really forthright and curious and has a lot of integrity. I admire her a great deal and feel so lucky to be able to see who she is becoming (she is trans and has been honoring herself in some pretty big ways lately and witnessing that from the sidelines has been really beautiful and touching). I am not sure how long we'll be together but for now I am very grateful she is in my life. "
happy,"Ever since my divorce my life has been soooo much better! I had no idea how much he was dragging me down financially, physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

I’ve paid off all my credit cards and have finally started saving — saving! I’m at my goal weight and I look and feel amazing. I have a gorgeous apartment that I get to decorate however I want; and since my tax return was huge then I actually have the money to do it!

For the first time in my life I only have ONE job, and it’s remote! 

The weather is glorious, my dog is the best ever, I have great friends, my plants are thriving, I love spending time with myself, and I’m even drinking less! 

Thanks for listening Internet strangers, it always feel like too much to brag to friends and family when you’re feeling this good! "
happy,"After 3-4 years of increasing exercise intolerance, I was diagnosed with a heart problem (SVT) 3 months ago. I'm only 40. At the time I could barely walk for 5 minutes. After medication I was up to 15 minutes walking in December. On Saturday, I completed a 2 mile walk outside (normally a big migraine trigger)! I haven't felt this good in 18 years! And the walk was for migraine awareness and education, so I learned about advocacy programs! This is a huge accomplishment for me and I am so incredibly happy. I'm actually tearing up just thinking about it! Now I can work on weight loss and socialize more, it's been absolutely life-changing."
happy,"I’m going with 2 of my close girl friends. I’ve done cruises with family before but I’ve never traveled as an adult, both in the US and internationally,  without family (parents) or husband. Now I’m 31, divorced, just got out of an awful relationship, and i am SO excited for these next adventures. I’m going to see some BEAUTIFUL places, learn fascinating history, drink, laugh, meet new people, and I can hardly wait. 

I’ve been through a pretty wild ride the last several years and I just feel like I am in a really good place. I have good friends, good family, a job I love that pays the bills, and I am able to do things like get a Disneyland pass and travel to new places. I am so happy and grateful to be where I am in life and I hope everyone finds this level of contentment ❤️"
happy,"Disney is like my escape from all the negativity in the real world. Despite being bullied for loving it, I don't care because Disney is something I truly adore, and no one can take that away from me. It's not just for kids; Walt Disney himself said, “I make films for the child in all of us, whether we be six or sixty.” Disney taught me to spread kindness, even when faced with mean people. Whether it's movies, shows, or visiting the parks, Disney has always been my happy place, and my love for it will last a lifetime!"
happy,"Walked around the store today and smiled at a few people sharing glances. It's noticeable their expression changes before you smile at them vs. after.

Was a good position and good pay but my manager went behind my back and basically just gave my position away and expected me to take the demotion purely because she was struggling at the other location and needed me back there to help. It was nothing to do with me or my work as I was really good at my job (don't mean to be bigheaded) but she allowed this other lady to introduce herself to all my colleagues as the manager of my location when they all know that i was there. 
I was really upset because it made it look like it was because I couldn't do my job and she completely broke any trust I had for her. I loved my job and I'm pretty upset BUT I stood up for myself and didn't stand for the lack of respect and told her where to go. I'm proud of myself for doing so and happy I'm no longer working under her. I'm confident I'll get a good job again that gives me the respect and decency I'm owed.

Just needed a lil rant lol don't mind me"
happy,That’s all. I’m a 53-year-old woman and I melted right then and there.
happy,"I was infantry, and I used to feel a certain amount a guilt having never killed.  Think of it as survivors guilt in a way, of others have to carry that burden what makes me so special?  But the older I get, the more I’m just all around glad and relieved.  We all think we will be fine when we join, but as you mature you realize there’s no telling how you’ll react.  I can finally, at least for today, say I’m perfectly fine having never been in that situation.  Some may look down on this, but kiss my ass after Taco Bell "
happy,"I gave birth ten months ago and it's been a struggle to have the discipline to get into a bedtime routine but now that I have, I have time to do some yoga before going to sleep. It feels like a huge accomplishment and I feel so much happier now that I'm getting back into physical exercise"
happy,"My family and I were a bit worried about her.  She’s 12 and we found something on her paw that we thought might have been a tumor.

Ten minutes ago we got a call indicating that it’s not.  I’m thrilled.  "
happy,"awww, thank you to whoever gave me gold! 


I'm trying to respond to everyone because I love you all for taking the time to comment."
happy,My husband is on the path to the airlines which means we get to spend lots of Sunday afternoons flying around to get hours. Sedona is always spectacular 
happy,"i do some challenge to keep living. there’s a thing as “tell your family “i love you”

i never had a family and ppl i knew was very much toxic and wanted to control me VERY VERY much

so i say “i love you” to my friends, they my family. no matter if we talk every day, once at week or if i see them once at month

you all my family. and i say, we says “we loves you”

don’t know if it’s counts then, but “family” is someone who make me to feel safe, love and accept me. not someone who controls me, insults and makes me to cry

so, yeah, we love you all and we happy to say it "
happy,"This was filmed at their album release party this past January. I think it rocks and wanted to share. They’re on Spotify and are already ready for a second album this summer. Really happy for him, he’s the guitarist in the cowboy hat and wrote this instrumental!"
happy,"Life is GOOD

Life is at an all time high rn. My grades are good, I'm a lot more athletic, I'm in a happy relationship (that's been going on for months now), I'm happier, and I'm making a lot of friends and most of all, my pizza rolls are done. Life is AMAZING RN!!"
happy,"I just wanted to share it with somebody who can appreciate it. I am a young aspiring writer and I have never got actual recognition for it before. It's a small contest, but I am still incredibly overjoyed by it. It was a short story, but I mostly specialise in those anyway. It feels so awesome to have someone see my work and like it.
I'm not even excited about whatever my reward will be. I'm just happy someone read that little story and enjoyed it."

happy,I work retail. I don't remember the last time I was called kind.
happy,"This morning I was walking around my apartment and my feet were cold from the tile floor. This was annoying until I realized that this meant my feet’s nerves were working again 🥳🥳🥳🥳. 

This is the first time this year it’s been cold where I live, so I’m not sure how long I have been able to feel the bottom of my feet for. Maybe it came back slowly and I just didn’t notice?

So what happened was several years ago I lost the feeling on the bottom of my feet and toes from wearing high heels for sorority recruitment. I was wearing high heels on concrete for 6 days around 10 hours a day and since I’m tall I had to stand in the back and jump nonstop every time girls were entering or leaving our sorority house.

After a few months the feeling returned to my toes but not the pads of the bottom of my feet. I had seen several specialists and they said pretty much there’s nothing we could do except wait and hope the nerves came back. After a couple of years I didn’t think they would ever come back.

I do not know how it is possible that the nerves could repair themselves years later. But they’re definitely back. I used my finger nail on the bottom of my feet and I can feel it so it isn’t just temperature I can feel 🥳🥳🥳

My feet now feel super tingly from the cold so I think they’re just having to readjust to being able to feel again or something but I’m so excited🥳🥳🥳"
happy,We’ve been dating for a year and about five months? They picked me up from my apartment and we went to a really nice restaurant. I was panicking so much.
happy,"I’ve been overweight for my entire life, and finally started trying to lose weight in a sustainable way back in December. As of this morning, I have lost 15 pounds! 

I have had trichotillomania (compulsive hair pulling, related to OCD and anxiety) for fifteen years. As of this morning, I have gone THREE DAYS without pulling! 

I’m a high school teacher, and this morning (after a pretty tough year), I found out that I get to teach my dream class next year!

I don’t have a lot of people to tell, but it was a really good day :) "
happy,"Ever since I was a teenager I wanted a pair but they were always too expensive for me. My BF took the plunge and for my birthday (which is in a month, but he wanted me to get the most out of these boots during January lol) him and my best friends split the costs on the gift. They are in the box next to my bed as I'm typing this. I feel like a little child that got a very precious toy and can't sleep without hugging it. I almost ran up the wall when I first tried them on.

I wanted to share this here. I feel bougie and expensive with these Demonia boots lol"
happy,"I'm big into the local music scene as a local musician, amateur gig photographer, and just general lover of grassroots music. For my birthday, my boyfriend secretly set-up a non-profit music promoter enterprise, booked four of my favourite local bands to play at a local grassroots venues on my birthday weekend, and arranged for all ticket sales to go to one of my favourite local charities! 

It's without a doubt the most thoughtful thing anyone has ever done for me, and I'm totally blown away by it!

Had been applying since 2 months"
happy,"It wasan't my first choice initially - i was shooting for medicine. 
But being real, i have no idea what i want to do with my life, even tough i am now legally responsible for it.

Even tough im not sure if its the degree i will end up pursuing a career in, i feel like at lleast not stuck in place, nor moving backwards. at least the one or two, max three years that i would have ""wasted"" dropping out would let me be sure thay law school just wasant for me.

all in all, im pretty satisfied -when my parents arent breathing down my neck thinking i will just play games all year and not pass the year."

happy,"When we were kids, our immediate family was pretty low-income. So when we were visiting, our grandpa would often take a few of the grandkids to “grab coffee” from a well known donut shop. We’d get there and he’d say to the employees, “A black coffee and a whatever these guys want.” 

My brother and I would have mere seconds to select a single donut from the wall of deliciousness, and I often would feel overwhelmed with choice in the moment. We loved going to “grab coffee” with grandpa. 

Fast-forward about 25 years or so, and my brother and I live far from our hometown in different states. I text him and he absolutely remembered getting donuts with Grandpa, so with a bit of planning, we roped a friend of mine in who still lives in the old stomping grounds. 

This morning, I called my grandpa, then added my brother to the call. Grandpa is 87, and had to put us on speakerphone because one of his hearing aids needed to be charged. We chat to him for a moment, then my friend (and his mom, who used to go to church with my grandpa) rolls up with a box of donuts and a black coffee. 

Grandpa was surprised and a little confused at first, but was delighted that we remembered his coffee after all these years. Then he hung up on us (most of his phone calls don’t last more than 60 seconds) so he could chat to my friend and his mom. 

Honestly, it was such a delight to organize something unexpected for such a generous and caring gentleman who had such an impact on me and my brother. 

TL/DR grandpa used to take us to get donuts so we had donuts delivered to him even though we live far away."
happy,"My washroom needed a good renovation for yearrrsss. Luckily, my dad does renovations for a living. With the help of our really friendly neighbour, they decided to take ln my washroom as their next project. I’m so happy a grateful for how it came out !!! :,DDD"
happy,"After 3 years of trying and IVF I'm now in my 28th week of pregnancy. 

My contract at work is ending before I go on maternity leave and I can't wait to have extra time to do all kinds of stuff for baby and the house in general. 

My husband is amazing and supportive in every way imaginable. 

My relationship with my parents have strengthened over the last couple of years and especially now that I'm pregnant. 

My friends write to me often even if we don't have as much time to see each other as we would like. 

I'm so happy I could burst with joy and gratitude. 

I wish everyone could feel this feeling but I'm scared if I talk too much about all the good things in my life it would come of as bragging?

Does anyone else have these thoughts?
How should I deal with it?

Thank you in advance and sorry for formatting I'm on my phone. "
happy,"I’m in community college, and I found that for this semester (spring semester) I’d gotten a bad English professor. I received a 25/50 on an assignment due to not formatting it correctly - on ratemyprofessor, many students were complaining about his oddly specific formatting rules (this man expected us to read five pages to adhere to his formatting guidelines… no thanks!) I’d actually started the assignment I received a 25/50 on early and had trouble submitting it in the docx form he really wanted us to submit it in, had to stop my Child Development Zoom meeting to call my college’s tech support at nighttime just to find a way to submit this assignment. This professor said he “wasn’t sure” and that I “still had time to call” when I asked him if I’d receive a 0 if I was unable to get the document submitted by the deadline even though I mentioned I’d started it early and that it was done. 

After much crying yesterday when seeing I had a 25/50 (this lowered my grade to a D+… I’ve never had a D+ in an English class) I simply decided, even though it means I’ll only be taking three courses this semester, to just drop the class. I have a job, I don’t know what I see myself doing in the future, and I felt like I just don’t have time for this, so I chose to drop the class. No extra stress needed. And I have no regrets about dropping it."
happy,"Wasn’t expecting this, but it’s one of the only things I’m happy about the past few days. I’m celebrating the little things in life.  Lol. 

I really respect this guy and his podcast is my favorite. I listened very religiously to it last year for a good portion of the year, and the year before that. It’s changed my life in a lot of ways. I was super stoked that he started following me recently and then even more excited to get a comment back from him! 

I’m such a nerd lol. I never thought he’d even know I existed. Haha. 

The internet is weird and people are people. I have to remind myself of this, but it’s still nice and I’m happy about it."
happy,"I’ve been in for four years, four years since I was seventeen. It’s been an experience and I’m so glad that I can go back home and see my family, my friends, travel more freely, attend university.

A bit about me i am a stupid guy never been smart was fat as a kid. I work in connection. And this guy looks op to me!

happy,"So it's been a while... I don't have my own kids to be proud of or excited for on their first day of school but I can be proud of and excited for myself. I have been in school for well over a year, which was a huge transition for me from who I was to begin with. But, today is my first day of classes in person... Over 20 years since I last sat in a classroom. I am excited for this. This is another step towards who I want to be. Here's to the future, and the work we put in to make one."
happy,I was able to buy the house mostly using money my mother left after she passed away.  And I think she'd be proud and happy knowing the hard work she put in while she was alive helped give me a new chance.  She always wanted me to live happy and now I am.
happy,"and also wanted to ask the you, the users of internet if I am the only one who thinks that she looks like soe kind of a fairy."

THE ONLY WAY IS DOWN!! 🥳"
happy,"I didn’t think I made enough money but I submitted my documents and they said I make way more than the qualifying amount. This is my first big adult real-life payment, and I’m so excited to move in. It’s an awesome place. "

happy,"I started an automotive apparel and parts brand back in 2012 as a “hobby”, just wanting to make some cool stuff for friends. A few years in, I took it on full time and I’ve been doing that ever since. It’s a lot of long days and sleepless nights but I finally achieved a goal I’ve been wanting since the beginning.

I’m so happy!"
happy,So what small things brings you joy or makes you happy? 
happy,"i'm going home and i'm so happy!

So for some context, I moved out to attend university over 6 months ago. It has been a tough but enjoyable experience so far and i have learnt many new things and made some new friends. Not a bad experience at all. However, i haven't seen my family and my cat (my pride and joy) since i left and i dearly miss them.

Today, my mom and i booked me a flight back home to visit for a whole month. I am so happy that i am full on happy sobbing. It doesn't seem like that much of a big deal, but it is to me and i am beyond excited!"
happy,"...Say Yes to the Dress! I've watched it before and it's always been a blast, but in the last two days I've been watching SYTTD Australia and Atlanta, and it's exactly what I need right now. So many happy and funny moments and it's just warm feeling to watch people embark on new incredible journeys, even when so much else feels like it's ending.

I love sharing joys and wins with people, and being able to do that with people I'll never meet is really filling a hole in my soul right now."
happy,"NSFW for mention of suicide 

This time last year I was lower than I've been. I remember having to pull my car over because I was crying so hard I couldn't see. I remember sitting with my loaded gun and the only thing that stopped me is kids often go to the park I was in. I remember trying to wreck into a semi after a particularly bad day. For years I was so depressed and so low I never imagined things could be this good. 

But now I wake up everyday overjoyed. I go to work and even though it's work I love it. I shower and I don't sit and cry. I ride with my windows down and sing along to my music and thank my God that I'm alive to see today. That I didn't opt out before I turned 18 like I thought I would. That I made it to 22 like I didn't believe I could. That I wake up today at 25 happier than I've ever been my entire life. I smile and I laugh and I love and I took control of what made my life so awful and kicked its ass until I had full control. 

I think back on all those years I spent unhappy and hating myself and harming myself and I wish I could talk to old me and tell her that it does get better. It takes a long time and alot of shit but you come out on top. 

25 is so young and my life is so full now and I just wanted someone to know. I'm just happy and that's all I've ever wanted and all I'll ever want. I'm just happy to be happy yall"

happy,"[unrelated image]
Hi, i just got in high school last week and I didn't know anyone except for a friend of mine that ended up on the same school as me. A friend of her  also ended up there (wich i didn't know until yesterday). I just think it's worth to say that my social skills are terrible (expected from a reddit user lol), and i just find so difficult to start conversations, meeting people and stuff like that. On the first week i was dead silent, didn't talk to anyone, i was too shy and embarrassed, and felt like i would be a inconvenience to anyone just trying to stay in peace. Then yesterday (second week already), that friend of mine and her friend were talking to each other and they came to my desk to say something, and just stayed there for the rest of the lunch break, and we talked for a while until the class resumed. But today was even cooler, some of the teachers didn't show up on class, and we just talked the entire time about our lives. And believe it or not, it gets even cooler: we live in the same region, so we get the same buses on our way to home, and guess what: we talked the entire way lol. It just feels so nice to have someone to talk with that isn't on the internet, i was really missing that in-person social interactions haha.
Anyway, i think I've never typed so much in english, I hope only the best for y'all, cya ;P"
happy," Last summer, there was a fat bumblebee hanging around in my neighbor's yard. My mom and I would talk to it whenever we went outside and he/she was there. The bumblebee would buzz towards us in a non-threatening way, back and forth, back and forth, almost dancing in a happy manner. This spring, another bumbly-bee is doing the same actions! This can't be the same bee (unless it's a queen?), but maybe said bumble passed the knowledge of me and mom being friendly.

I'm always happy to see the bumbly-bee when I go outside!"
happy,"There used to be a falling down house across the street from me. Some realtor picked it up on a property tax sale and tore it down. Should have been no big deal and just a normal tear down and rebuild, right? Along the way, I noticed it was taking forever to build 2 homes they decided to build on the lot. It's been almost 2 years since construction started, 1 house is complete, the 2nd is about half finished. I'm home with a work injury, so there isn't much else to watch but this build and the boob tube. And of course, my dogs go berserk whenever people show up over there.

Dogs are going off one day and I look to see what set them off. It's a mold abatement company. I didn't really think too much of it, and a year passed before the house was complete. My friend tells me after she has signed the contract that she's moving across the street from me. That's when the alarm bells went off in my head. I let her know to be thorough in her inspection because they'd already treated this brand-new home for mold. Her jaw hits the floor, and she says that the owner/realtor (both are the same person) didn't disclose that.

There are other problems, like none of the dirt from digging in water lines, nor any gravel in preparation for driveways and sidewalks being compacted. None of the cement has rebar to reinforce and strengthen it to stand up to our winters. The un-compacted water line trenches run under both driveways. I guess hauling off piles of dirt wasn't a clue to the builder that it might be a problem later.

Final inspection day comes, and it takes 2 pry bars operated by 2 fairly large men to get the access to the crawl space open because it's so wet in the crawl space it has made the wood swell quite a bit. Not only is the crawlspace infested with mold, but against code, the crawl space wasn't built with any ventilation. So my friend got out of the contract, and the owner/realtor will likely lose her real estate license for not making proper disclosures.

Yes, it sucks that she has to look for another house, but she's so happy she didn't get stuck in a mold infested trap. And funnily enough, you can hear fans running from over there 24/7 in both houses."
happy,"I know this sounds silly. 

But my friend is going through a bad divorce. He's been abused for 30 years by a wack job. He got kicked out of his place, and I offered my couch. 

We're sitting on my bed, watching a movie, and high. He has had a terrible day, so I'm trying to make it better. I noticed he took a picture of a gift I got him and posted it to a Reddit sub. 

I asked what he was doing, and he got so excited. He told me he was in this nice sub and everyone is so welcoming, that his post got 700 karma. He is very, very new to this app and is older, so he's not up to snuff with everything. 

But he just lit up when he showed me how excited he was that people were talking to him and that they liked his post so much that he got ""a little karma"" 

This man has cried his eyes out for hours tonight; seeing him beam about something so small just filled my heart. I'm overjoyed to see him this excited! 

Anyway, I just, really want this man to be happy, so for this small thing to really bring him joy just makes my chest burn.

Edit: 

If you all want to give him some love I'll link his art post. It'll make him very excited that people enjoy his art. He only ever shares it within his work space. Not sure why but I think it'll get him excited.

My parents don’t love me and haven’t for a long time and I’m happy with that. Recently, my parents have shown their true colors to a lot of people, especially me. I’ve come to learn that they have only loved me conditionally, if I provide something to them. They weaponize my siblings against me, try to financially cripple me, and just try to make me feel as bad as possible. Ever since I’ve been sure of what I wanna do for a career, my mother and sister have constantly belittled it. My mother has said that my sister is her favorite and my parents have always shown that for as long as I can remember. I realize now that they don’t love me anymore and I’m happy I can move on with my life. I’ve accepted that they never will for as long as I live, and I can finally grow and surround myself with people who truly love and care about me. "

happy,"So, my brother and I were walking to the store just to pick up some stuff. We got in and I went to the drinks section, to get a flavoured water. Some kid who looked a little older than us was half-way blocking the drink I needed to get (I don't care, I'm really patient), and when he noticed, immediately apologized and moved. I felt bad, I said ""no, it's alright!"", and he mumbled something inaudible to me afterwards, but smiled, so did I. 

My brother and I got our items, and were waiting in line. It was just the guy from the drinks section in front of us. He payed for his stuff, then handed a 10 dollar bill to the worker, and said, ""That's to pay for them"", pointing to us, whilst exiting the store. We thanked him, and he said ""You guys are nice"", and he was out of the store. It all happened really fast, but it paid for our stuff. We left and his dad or someone was already driving away. He waved, and we did too. It was just really sweet I thought. I hadn't had that happened to me before."

happy,"So I've worked for getting on 6 years now 

Been senior support for about 3-4 years. Which involves working 24 hour shifts 

For the last year or so I've been doing a lot of the manager work without the extra pay, this is because the current deputy was not really able to do the tasks 

Well I was having a bit of a moan over the Easter bank holidays because I had finished three 24 hour shifts when the regional manager started sending me a series of tasks for some reason (my bosses boss) and I did it all promptly while moaning at myself for being a push over 

Turns out the regional manager then asked my boss why I'm not the deputy as I seem better for the role.

This lead to a discussion with the current deputy who said that she is more than happy to step down from the position for me to take over 


So I'm happy to have gotten recognition from someone high up the chain but also I will now only be working one 24 hour shift a week and will have 16 hours office hours throughout the week 

Also I still get a pay rise of course aha "
happy,"23 Male and going through a Major Depression to the point I rarely get out of my bed unless I have to go to my shitty job.

I was just endlessly scrolling when I got a call from an old highschool friend of mine. What's funny is that I've always wanted to contact my old highschool friends but insecurities and self doubt always gets the better of me.

He called me to ask how I was doing, and of course I lied and said I was doing OK. He said he was doing fine too and we talked for a bit. And he also asked that we should hang out sometime, and said sure. 

I know it might seem sad and pathetic to be happy over a call but that made me feel good."
happy,"First of all, English isn't my first language so please understand. 

I come from a country and a community where dating culture isn't very big. Me and my brother have a 8 year age gap (he's younger). As a result, we don't relate to the same stuff, share similar likes/dislikes or even talk a lot about our personal lives or choices. Although I find a friend in him and he's been protective, caring; he barely talks about his friends, or problems, etc. 

But today! Oh boy, I'm still smiling ear to ear!
Today he called me out of the blue( lives in a different city) and asked me for an outfit suggestion because he was going to go meet this girl he has had a crush on. That alone, made me so happy! In that moment, I knew he found me helpful, I knew he trusted me with that as probably my parents would not approve of him skipping classes to go meet her, and I was happy that he came to me when he felt like he was stuck.
I gave him a suggestion, appropriate for a first date (of his life) and he left. I was fine, happy that he was happy. It was just a little meet at a cafe at evening, they decided to have some snacks, talk etc and head back their own ways.

Fast forward three hours, HE CALLED me.. n he told me how great the date was!! I NEVER expected he'd call and share that with me! N he was so giggly (I don't know if that's even a word, sorry) and chirpy and happy and nervous and so much more lol! He told me, that she looked so beautiful this evening, that he couldn't utter a word. So he scrolled through Instagram, luckily came across a picture of  beautifully arranged flowers and he sent that post to her with a message that said - ""you look this beautiful today"". My little brother, ladies and gentlemen!! He's 19. 19!!! We never have seen anyone go on a date except in movies and stuff ig. And this guy was like 5yo just a couple years ago 🥺🥺When did he grow up so fast! 

N to top all that, he thanked me - he THANKED ME for helping him know how to treat a girl right! He thinks I'm nice. He trusts me. He ACTUALLY looks up to me!!🥺
I. Am. Melting! 
I'm happy a ton! Sorry if this is too long. To the ones who stuck till the end, you people are my angels. I just wanted to share this. ❤️

happy,"Getting groceries with my(31) wife(29) and our 3 month old baby yesterday, I saw a kid standing in the middle of the aisle blocking someone trying to get their cart through. He turned and noticed them, stepped to the side and said ""oh excuse me!"". The parent around our age said ""good job (kids name) that was very polite!"". He said ""thanks, we have to think about other people too right?"", to which she replied ""that's exactly right"" and gave him a firm one arm hug.

Thinking about that this morning, it makes me so happy to see people teaching compassion and thoughtfulness nowadays. She seemed to be very involved as a parent, and I can't wait to be/teach that way for our daughter. Idk why but that thought is hitting that happy cord so hard today, just felt like sharing!"
happy,"Hi guys, 

So I’ve been doing some meditations that have really been working for me lately and I have a few things in my life that are going well and am in a couple blessed situations. I’m starting to have moment of real happiness on levels I don’t know if I’ve had before. I think mostly due to the meditations because it’s not externally dependent. 

I still have daily struggles and things I’m working on. A lot more than people know. Even the fact that I’m working on my struggles and am seeing them getting better is making me happy. I’ve had a lot of suffering in my life, especially within myself about myself and to witness imrovement is like witnessing a wonder, a miracle. 

I keep running into the situation where I tell people about the good things in my life, in a super excited way, (it could even be a new positive way I’m perceiving the world), and I feel (or at least perceive (I could be projecting)) it making people uncomfortable or I feel that I am being too much. I notice within me a fear of being unrelatable expressing the goodness in my life. I’m afraid of making people jealous. I feel like I need to then tone down the positive thing I said with something more “down to earth” (though I don’t because I see that urge rising from an anxiety about how others perceive me and to not try to “fix” it) 

I feel like I need to be more tactful than I am and I’m curious if anyone has any advice? One thing I’m trying not to do is tone myself down for others comfort (I’ve often done this when going out to not make other girls jealous) but also I don’t want to come off as chaotic or make people feel bad. 

On some level writing this does make me feel like it’s okay to be unapologetically happy/well. Maybe that’s how relaxed people are and I’m just learning/relearning it. 

Grateful for your input.
Thank you . "
happy,"Made me happy, They seem happy. I'm filming the wild monkeys that frequent my garden and was surprised with how quickly doing this brought joy to my life...only thing is I am a bit attached now.

happy,"The dress was 2 sizes smaller than her body shape, and then, today was the day, pure happiness in her face, I'm so happy and proud of her 🥹❤️"
happy,"Five years ago I didn't see a future for myself at all. I was sleeping in my rideshare rental car, was in a crappy part time job that I hated, and was living with severe anxiety. Sixteen months ago, I took a chance and decided to give school another try. Thanks to financial aid and scholarships, tuition assistance from my current job, and support from a lot of people around me, I now have an AA in Political Science and graduated Phi Theta Kappa with honors. I have gotten offers from several schools to transfer/finish my BA, including some really good schools (one is an Ivy League school). I've wanted to move to the East Coast (NYC area) since I was 15 and finally have the opportunity at the end of this year, and will be finishing my BA there. My dream is to become a history teacher; history is AWESOME because it helps us to learn about so many facets of society and humanity, and education is a very noble, yet very under-appreciated field that I wish more people would look into. Learning is magical, and as long as we are alive, we have a chance to learn something new."
happy,"I have been struggling with IBS for over a year - the bloating, constipation, constant anxiety, experimenting with supplements; MSM, L- Glutamine, Vitamin C. I have also done the castor oil thing, but to no avail. 

However, last week I decided to finally go the antibiotics route and got flagyl. And surprisingly, it worked. I have had zero symptoms for the past 3 days. I am super happy."
happy,"This isn't an advertisement or anything like that, I just love it. 

I work two jobs from home, and I didn't follow the advice of ""Separate your work space from your personal space"" (it's better for your mental health) so I spend effectively 13 hours a day at my desk, with my work PC and personal PC on the same desk right next to one another. I flip my monitor between PCs, so the space I used to go to to have fun, play games, and hang out with online friends is effectively ruined by 13 hours a day being trapped in this spot. I work from 5AM-7PM and get one single day off a week. Of COURSE I'm not going to want to spend another *second* of my time at that desk than I have to. 

Obviously, this caused all my steam games to go neglected, as well as the couple little online friends I keep up with. This simply can't do. So, I bought a steam deck. 

What a wonderful little handheld computer! It can run a few itch.io games on it, they don't even have to be steam games! And there's a game from 2005 that REALLY DIDN'T like the steam deck when I first launched it (The fucking mouse cursor was controlled by the gyro function for some reason?!) but the controls are so customizable on that thing that within just 20 or 30 minutes of messing with it I got it running so comfortably that it's not just tolerable but *enjoyable* to play on the deck. I love it. It was so easy to figure out, so easy to personalize, and it's just great. 

I play games more now than I even did on my PC before I was work from home. In fact, I prefer the steam deck over my PC. I'm just not a graphics-heavy gamer and the games I play don't require fast reflexes and pinpoint accuracy, so the deck is perfect for my style of single player meandering-along story games. And I always tended to enjoy a controller more than mouse and keyboard anyway. So, just having all my games be mobile?! Man. Least regrettable big purchase I have made in a WHILE. I would buy a new one tomorrow if my current one broke. 

Again, not an advertisement. I'm just a casual gamer, with casual games, which I love to casually enjoy. And the invention of such a neat, user friendly, handheld ""gaming"" computer makes me happy. Happy-happy!!! 

Edited to add: Oh, didn't even mention. The #1 benefit is that I can be snuggled up to my family members while gaming! That's honestly the main reason I bought it. I love the people I live with and being trapped in my room all the time means I can't see them, and if I wanted to game, I'd have to take away even more time from the 3 hours a day I get to visit with them. The steam deck gives me the benefit of cuddles AND gaming. Truly living the life here, folks. "
happy,"Life update: you may remember me from this post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/b5p72v/comment/ejhehp6/](https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/b5p72v/comment/ejhehp6/)

But so many things have happened since then. You guys truly changed my life at that moment and I wouldn't have even gotten started without you guys. I've been picked up by a small but pretty successful publisher, DYB Publishing, for both my seven book fantasy series and science fiction trilogy.  I also went to my first anime convention last week and almost sold out (despite me almost dying from social anxiety). And I just wanted to come by and thank all of you! Also here are some pictures!

happy,"We sat and talked for 6 hours yesterday and she said a lot of sweet things to me; like saying I was one of the best things to happen to her (I said that one first; she just said it back). I wish I wrote down the rest of them because I already forgot most of it (my memory is so bad and my life is so dramatically different than it was 3 months ago; new huge things are happening every week; last night I just got the keys to a house on the beach in Venice). There was one thing she said which did stick out, though:

""You're my type: extraordinary.""

No one has ever come close to making me that happy with less than 6 words.

Anyway, I'm about to make one of the biggest pivots of my life. I got an offer to leave the US and move to Switzerland\* and possibly Germany for a bit, so I'm working to change every last piece of me that has been holding me back. I don't know what I will resemble at the end of this, but I know, to at least one person, one of the most amazing people I've ever met, they found me extraordinary at one point in my life.

I honestly don't know that I could ask for a better compliment.

Anyway.

To future me, if you end up reading this, and you're feeling down, you were extraordinary to one of the most amazing people you ever met. That should not ever not matter to you.

\* it was somehow endearing how upset she got over this; I hate hurting her, even if it was inadvertent, but seeing her very upset texts burst through as I'm ""reviving"" my dead phone from an eventful night, was so \*damn\* heart-warming."
happy," I've been the happiest I've been for at least the past five years. No real complaints, no real worries. I mean, little day to day things like in a sitcom, but nothing crazy. I get up not worried about hating my job, don't think I have any real enemies, have a wonderful family and have the means to take care of them. Not religious either, so this is not fueled by my love for a higher being.

I found what makes me happy and don't really need anything else. Delighted to share my positive vibes if anyone needs some."
happy,"today i got in a car accident. i wasn't doing well lately and that car accident and the headache made me go in deep episode of depression. 

later i found myself in a ai image generator. i asked it to make one of my happiest days in the not so happy life of mine. and you know what? it didn't disappoint me.

this is a date i had with my love of life. it was beautiful day. i wore red polo shirt that she gave me in my birthday (she is one of 2 people who cares about my birthday) and she wore this outfit (pink skirt, white shir, pink hijab) that she wore in the day that i started loving her. before that we used to be friends, and we spoke a lot. i used to think of her as the coolest girl out there. and she thought of me like this as well (yes i said cool, yes we were young and yes i still do think of her as the coolest girl out ther). one day we decide to meet, i went to to that location, when i saw her from a distance and she smiled at me from far, wearing this outfit it i fall in love, 

we met to give her her birthday present (black hijab from the type she loves so much but she didn't have a black one, and inside of it i put a kindder surprise as a extra surprise for later).

so later in the relationship after i confessed and growing together loving each other more and more, we met in one of our walk dates (dates is kinnda illegal here) i wore this shirt that she gave me and a bracelet that she made for me before my confession (really sweet gift), and she wore my favorite outfit she had (she knows how to make me happy).

in this date we hold hands for the first time ever. we have been loving each other for over a year and half by now. (i know it may be something alien to most of you but we live in different place with different rules.)

so this is a small part of our story. it made me happy to remember these days even with all of my cournt problems.


thank you for reading. i hope you have a happy day as well <3"
happy,"After long hard months of grinding applications, interviews and dealing with the anxiety that comes along with it I have finally received a job offer from a company that I really like.

Always remember that if you are willing to work hard enough to achieve something that it is always possible! Don’t give up!"

happy,"Things I saw the other morning on the way to work that made me genuinely feel happy and exclaim loudly (like, actually out loud) with joy :

🐾 Walking across the carpark saw a man walking his tiny dachsund puppy, he stepped off the curb but had to stop and look back cos the puppy had sat down on the edge of the curb. So the guy went back and picked him up and put him on the road and then the puppy walked after him with a big waggy tail.

The step off the curb was too high!! 🥹

🎈3 hot air balloons coming into land nearby. I saw about 5 in the sky but there were 3 landing in a park along the trainline. They're huge! I've never seen that before!! It was very exciting for me!!

Kinda made my day. No photos, but it all happened. Just wanted to share my feelings of joy. 😊

Have a good day!!!"
happy,Met my bestfriends girlfriend and when we were alone for a little bit she told me “he talks about you all the time and it’s really obvious you mean so much to him and he looks up to you. i’m really glad he has you he needs you”. It just felt so damn good man. Usually it’s people talking bad behind your back but he is praising me to his GIRLFRIEND. I feel so loved man.
happy,"I have always worked construction and trades jobs my whole life but a few years ago I took a leap and decided to do something with my creative side. It has always been my dream to work in a creative field as I’ve always loved art and design. So I’ve been going to university for graphic design for the past two years online. I’ve been working meaningless part time jobs in retail and maintenance to pay my bills while going to school. 

A little while ago my friend gave me a tip that his company was hiring and it’s in the industry. Long story short I beat the other applicants and was hired!!! I am now a layout editor for a media company. I specialize in newspaper page layouts. For the first time in my life I’m actually making a living wage and can afford to live normally. Nothing fancy but I’m doing more than just surviving now. I couldn’t be happier. Follow your dreams kids!!"
happy,"After many failed relationships (they all cheated) I’m finally happy with a guy that is just as happy with me. 

He got me a gift and I can’t stop bawling my eyes out. No one besides family, of course, has ever gotten me a gift before.

I’m so happy!"
happy,"So I'm 16 and over 300lbs, and yesterday I made a post about me taking my first proper walk in over a year. Y'all made me feel so seen, I felt like I wasn't alone in this journey and I'm appreciative of all of you. I want to make an update everyday to hold myself accountable in a public space. I hope that my posts can inspire just 1 person to start doing the same. Cheers!"
happy,"When we were kids, our immediate family was pretty low-income. So when we were visiting, our grandpa would often take a few of the grandkids to “grab coffee” from a well known donut shop. We’d get there and he’d say to the employees, “A black coffee and a whatever these guys want.” 

My brother and I would have mere seconds to select a single donut from the wall of deliciousness, and I often would feel overwhelmed with choice in the moment. We loved going to “grab coffee” with grandpa. 

Fast-forward about 25 years or so, and my brother and I live far from our hometown in different states. I text him and he absolutely remembered getting donuts with Grandpa, so with a bit of planning, we roped a friend of mine in who still lives in the old stomping grounds. 

This morning, I called my grandpa, then added my brother to the call. Grandpa is 87, and had to put us on speakerphone because one of his hearing aids needed to be charged. We chat to him for a moment, then my friend (and his mom, who used to go to church with my grandpa) rolls up with a box of donuts and a black coffee. 

Grandpa was surprised and a little confused at first, but was delighted that we remembered his coffee after all these years. Then he hung up on us (most of his phone calls don’t last more than 60 seconds) so he could chat to my friend and his mom. 

Honestly, it was such a delight to organize something unexpected for such a generous and caring gentleman who had such an impact on me and my brother. 

TL/DR grandpa used to take us to get donuts so we had donuts delivered to him even though we live far away."
happy,"Growing up I was very thin, but in 2020 I got diagnosed with PCOS I went from 64kgs to 87 kgs over night making all my clothes tight and impossible to wear. I developed and still have body dysmorphia. 
I would always have to buy multiple shein clothes to find something that would fit me. 
Yes plus size exists but I’m one size too small for plus size and one size too big for XL.

Yesterday I went to a shop and found 3 dresses in the style I love 
Which fit me perfectly and had every colour and pattern I wanted I bought 3. But I might god back and get some more. 

I might not be so exciting for others but for me, it made me feel so beautiful and accepted and just happy. "

happy,"I can't believe I know how to play chess now. I always shunned it because I thought it required way too much thinking for it to be any kind of fun game, but now that I know how the pieces move, I feel like I can do a lot more intellectual things. Really, I learned how to play for two reasons: I quit two of my greatest addictions and really needed something new to occupy my mind. The other reason is because someone once asked me if I knew how to play chess, and it came off as them questioning my intelligence, and I didn't like that at all. So, now I finally know how to play and have so much more I can learn, which is great because I have so much time on my hands.

I'm having a blast! I can't believe I never took the time to learn this very great game. I'm so happy!"

I never thought I would get behind the wheel of a car. Fear and anxiety being a factor but something has always gotten in the way any time I thought about it over the years.

I am so proud of myself for doing something entirely outside of my comfort zone and gaining new independence. 

Happy is an understatement."
happy,"And I rigged it up to open with a fake book. This is something I've always, always wanted, and it makes me ridiculously happy to have finished the project.

happy,"I got the Sony WH-1000XM4’s and they’re so amazing. The sound quality is so nice and I can’t get over the noise cancellation feature. Everything is so quiet and I feel so much calmer. Noises put me on edge sometimes when I’m overwhelmed (often), so they have just helped a lot. :D"
happy,"I shouldn’t be writing this since I’m about to go to bed

But sitting at my work desk I was feeling a little stressed about life

But something made it all go away

I closed my eyes… and starting imagining

*Imaging my future*

A future where I’m with my future daughter and I’m pushing her on a swing

She’s smiling so much and laughing and calling me daddy.

*-you can make it weird, but honestly it was super cute*

I could clearly see her face so happy

*Then another time*

We’re at the beach and she’s older, a teenager

And the next scene I’m on my death bed with 5-7 kids around me

I’m smiling and they’re crying

In the present, the me who is sitting at my work desk is also smiling befause I’ve realised

**There is no reason to be stressed**

Thjngs can’t be bad forever, they never are, the only way to make it out of a stressful situation is to keep going and having hope.

Key lesson: start doing positive future visualisations when you’re lost.

They’ll change your life

I hope this post is valuable to anyone feeling lost.

happy,"Hit my lowest point ever a few months ago. Went out to the train tracks to end it all, not gonna lie. The cause was the ending of a five year relationship, naively thinking that they were the 'one' and all that junk. 

What saved me, and is keeping me going, is... the various friends I made along my healing journey (seriously, both new and old friends really stepped up to help), discovering awesome new hobbies (photography, boxing, fishing, etc), rediscovering the joy in old hobbies (cycling, foraging, language learning, etc), learning to love myself, helping others (got stuck focusing all my love on one person), becoming more involved in my community, and just letting go of my frustrations and anxieties and just living in the moment! 

And... the cherry on top is that I ended up meeting this pretty awesome friend who I'm, honestly, relating to and vibing with. Life is like ""hey, you're doing great with self love and healing, here's your reward: a friend who is almost identical to you, enjoy!"" Hahahaha so awesome! 

Looking forward to being done with university next year and being able to live a happy and fulfilling life :) and so many other dreams and goals to look forward to!"

She's been my little special buddy for so many years now and knowing I can still scoop her up and give her kisses warms my heart.

I felt bad, I said ""no, it's alright!"", and he mumbled something inaudible to me afterwards, but smiled, so did I. 

My brother and I got our items, and were waiting in line. It was just the guy from the drinks section in front of us. He payed for his stuff, then handed a 10 dollar bill to the worker, and said, ""That's to pay for them"", pointing to us, whilst exiting the store. We thanked him, and he said ""You guys are nice"", and he was out of the store. It all happened really fast, but it paid for our stuff. We left and his dad or someone was already driving away. He waved, and we did too. It was just really sweet I thought. I hadn't had that happened to me before."
happy,"I have two beautiful kids that I love dearly and they are both my bonus children. My husband made an appointment for tomorrow to start the ball rolling on reversing his vasectomy. 

When we met he told me he didn’t really believe in marriage and he already had his children. I said I was fine with that, and I was. But time has passed and we’ve moved together and grown together. He tells me I’m the best mother he’s ever seen, that I deserve my own and that he desperately wants it too. Our kids ask us constantly when we’re going to have a baby. Hopefully we can answer that soon. 

Send us some baby dust on this Valentine’s Day. 🫶🏼"

happy,"I was infantry, and I used to feel a certain amount a guilt having never killed.  Think of it as survivors guilt in a way, of others have to carry that burden what makes me so special?  But the older I get, the more I’m just all around glad and relieved.  We all think we will be fine when we join, but as you mature you realize there’s no telling how you’ll react.  I can finally, at least for today, say I’m perfectly fine having never been in that situation.  Some may look down on this, but kiss my ass after Taco Bell "
happy,"Im 17F, a highschool senior, the past year I’ve been doing an engineering internship at a different company that sells stuff that refineries and other companies buy, including this company. I also placed 3rd at a state drafting competition. My school guidance counselor got an email from this refinery saying they saw my accomplishments in the newspaper and are offering me an internship.

HOLY SHIT THIS IS MASSIVE. THIS PLACE IS NOTORIOUS FOR BEING DIFFICULT TO GET INTO!! AND IM NOT EVEN IN COLLEGE EITHER!!!! I AM ACTUALLY SO HAPPY. 

I don’t know what exactly I did to get this, BUT IM NOT COMPLAINING YIPPEEEEEE"
happy,"Yesterday I received a personal email from a University I applied to that stated how impressed they were with it and how interested they are in my “eclectic interests”. They said they would love to talk to me in person or if I can’t do so via FaceTime! This was a huge confidence boost in my skills as a writer, I’m so happy!"

happy,This is my girlfriend of 7 years and both of our kids 5 year old girl and 3 year old boy. We both worked a long day but wanted to treat our kids to some fun at the park before the sun went down and go to Dairy Queen to end the night! We have been through some hard times but no matter what the light always will shine the next day and I have to keep my light shining!!!
happy,"I (25m) have been going out with a coworker of mine (23f) for about a month now after flirting for a few weeks before that. I've been pretty gushy the whole time, but she has some baggage from a past relationship ship that's made it hard for her to fully commit to relationship. 

Well last week, one of our other coworkers told me that she actually refered to me as her boyfriend for the first time while complaining that our manager didn't give us more shifts together, and a couple days ago she called me for the first time instead of the texting we've been doing to tell me she loves me. 

This is my first relationship since a meaningless highschool situationship, and I am just over the moon and need to get this off my chest"
happy,💗
happy," I am so happy. Today I was able to get my own room after having been homeless for a few months. Lost my job and previous home and this last two years have been rough, but definitely back on track now. What a blessing!

 Edit: Can't really believe this got so much attention. Your messages feel amazing to me and I would love to post more of it as I save up and can start upgrading some things and making the room more 'mine'.

Much love to everyone!"
happy,"Whether it's a big life success or just taking time to look at the daisies, I want to hear about what's made you smile and feel happy to be here. This is a great place to get some celebration for your successes or have someone share in your joy."

I included a picture of the goose (i got the largest one) :))"
happy,"So I’ve been wanting to be more like my awesome marathon runner Papa. He’s always been a wonderful athlete! Running marathons when he was younger to playing softball now, in his 80’s. He’s the coolest guy, I’m dying to be more like him. Not just physically but emotionally too. He’s always been so chill. 

I set a goal to try to walk five miles every other day just to start, and to my surprise I’ve actually gone and done it! Pokémon GO tracks the duration of my walks and I’ve walked more than thirty miles each week for the past three weeks. I’m over the moon! 🐮 Just wanted to share some happy news. I hope you all have a nice day today!  

"
happy,"A while ago I wanted to download a game from my childhood because I remember really liking the music. I'm waaay too old for anything in it of course and don't have kids but I wrote a review baisicly saying that it made my childhood and that even though I've grown out of it I still adore it. I checked today and found out that the creator of the game wrote back a review saying ""We were so pleased! We are extremely glad that we brought happiness to your childhood! This is our goal! Thank you very much for these words on behalf of the whole team! Be healthy!"" (Translated from bulgarian). Actually crying tears of joy this was so sweet."
happy,"I was tired of my life. I woke up one day and realized I have been “winging” it and “half-assing” through life. I’m not in a terrible place. I have a decent paying management job in infrastructure. But this wasn’t the life young me wanted.

I got accepted in college and I’m about to start classes. I scored insanely well on the accuplacer (after countless hours studying). And the end goal is to finally pursue my dream and become a lawyer. It was my dream all as a child. But I spent too much time in high school skipping class and hitting the reefer. I graduated high school with a 2.0 GPA. I didn’t even understand math at all. I had Fs in every math class. But I self taught my self advance algebra and statistics in a matter of weeks before my test. And I’m so proud of that. (I was proud when I was doing 7th grade math test and passing lol) 

I’m sharing on here because I’m divorced and kinda alone. No one is by my side to share the joy with me. And all my coworkers laughed at me and one of my coworkers (who dropped out in 7th grade) keeps telling me how dumb I am for doing it. I just wanted to get it off my chest in a safe area because I’m genuinely stoked. 

This is a massive vent and humble brag. "
happy,"Not only was I drinking out of despair for my unfortunate life, but I was making my life more unfortunate with drinking. I was depressed. Couldn’t hold a job. Was in debt. Unhealthy life habits and terribly unhealthy, both physically and mentally. Had toxic friendships and relationships. Deep down I hated myself and thought it was the life I deserved, and I couldn’t ever live a happy life. 9 months ago I decided to change that. My whole life has turned around! I’ve lost weight, am finally experiencing true happiness, have a wonderful partner and meaningful relationships, am constantly working on making my self and life better, and may even be able to retire before I hit 30.  Oh, and I am nearly 3 months sober of weed as well!!!!

Today is such a good day. "
happy,"Hello everyone! If you look on my profile I’ve posted once a year about my weight loss. I started originally at 320 (although I was too embarrassed to admit it) and got to I think 250 before I got hurt, gained more weight, lost some. Now for 2023. Over the end of 2022 and into 2023 I let a coworker treat me to lunch every day. Where I ate a ton and really fell back into my old terrible habits and all that.
Since September something in me changed. (Also me and that coworker stopped talking, they were a terrible influence but I’m not go into that here) I have cut out most sugars and in general crappy food out. I usually eat one good meal a day. 
I originally started this just to lose weight out of embarrassment of how bad I had let myself go. Now, I just want to feel better. I’ve seen how much my diet change has improved how I feel and the lost weight helps a ton too. I feel so much better about myself. I just want to change now for the betterment of my health, now for how I look.
So here’s my post this year to keep myself accountable (and also people have said they wanted to see my updates as the years go on)
My end goal right now for this year is to be near 220, but I’d REALLY like to be under 200. So let’s see how 2024 will treat me and you and I hope we can accomplish our goals. If you made it this far reading, I thank you! See you next year!"
happy,"I’m so excited. This is a job I’ve wanted for ages and I feel like people take me seriously and respect me professionally, which I’ve never really experienced as I’m still 20 and in college. 

I get to go to a new city I’ve never seen before, go to fancy dinners every night and get paid for it!! Also I feel like I’ve made my dad proud of me so that’s an added bonus. "
happy,"I (25m) am in a relationship for the first time in my adult life and can not describe how happy I am.

Towards the end of October last year my boss told me that one of my co-workers (23f) who I did also consider a friend had told her she had a crush on me. I admitted that while I had never really considered it before, if she was interested I was willing to give it a go. We started flirting and a couple weeks later we had our first date. 

The funny part is that at the beginning of January my now girlfriend and I were talking and it came out that while we were definitely friends rather than just co-workers at the time, neither of us had considered a romantic relationship until our boss told us both that the other was interested and we realized that our boss had just been bored and decided to play matchmaker. We have since confronted our boss and thanked her for doing what she did.

We are both incredibly happy with our situation now and incredibly grateful to our bored meddling boss for setting us up (and creating two incredibly inefficient employees)."
happy,"I'm celebrating today!
I found out a lot about myself during this year because of reddit and people here.

thank you all, folks!"
happy,"Disney is like my escape from all the negativity in the real world. Despite being bullied for loving it, I don't care because Disney is something I truly adore, and no one can take that away from me. It's not just for kids; Walt Disney himself said, “I make films for the child in all of us, whether we be six or sixty.” Disney taught me to spread kindness, even when faced with mean people. Whether it's movies, shows, or visiting the parks, Disney has always been my happy place, and my love for it will last a lifetime!"
happy,"Today's been a really lovely. I felt so at peace handwashing antique quilts in textile cleaner to remove the yellow age stains so they become like new again, just a couple spots need to be patched up and already have some choice fabrics in mind (got some really nice cotton calico prints at a free sale a couple years ago and a few nice quilt squares at a church sale). Save that project for a rainy day. Went out to some yard sales today and got some nice antique furniture for really cheap and some work clothes. I love looking at how they joined wood furniture back then, no nails or screws, just complex wood joinery and yet it's so unbelievably sturdy. The solid cedar wardrobe needs to be stripped, sanded and stained with a wood oil but it's lovely and has a cute little mirror and hanger and everything. I really loved how helpful the gentleman selling it was too. He helped carry the furniture into my vehicle and he just seemed really kind and gentle. His mum raised him right. Something about this being his mum's furniture is bittersweet. That's the wonderful thing about these older pieces, they're loved and I hope whoever takes on these pieces after me, loves them equally as much. I do wonder sometimes who the craftsman is behind all of this. It's kind of paying tribute to his art and how it carries on after death. 😊🥰"
happy,"Figuring out my future

I know this sounds so silly but I F18 and finally had the epiphany of how important school, college and university is.
 
The majority of people in my area aren’t taught this in school therefore others my age drop out of college, do boring 9-5 jobs and don’t see the importance of their education.

Luckily I go to a college closer to the capital city of my country where everyone has a better work ethic, than the locals I’ve been influenced by. 

I used to be so confused as to my my peers would be so motivated to go to class everyday, work hard, revise for exams etc, usually I would skip class, stay home, not revise.
Until I realised the importance of how these few years of education, trial and error and putting in your best actually shape your entire life! 

I was reading up on the entry requirements for the courses I’d want to do in uni and never realised you’d actually need good grades, and a college degree etc.

I know I seem silly for only realising all of this now, but I’m actually feeling very hopeful for my future and I’m looking forward to it.
I haven’t felt like this before and hope this post can help more less educated people like me! Better late than never! 💛💛"
happy,"I'm so so happy I looks at wedding photos and FEEL how much he loves me, how happy I am!"
happy,"So happy right now. 

I made some new friends through work. The three of us clicked immediately on the first day. 

Tonight, we went to dinner at my favorite restaurant (Korean BBQ). We ate so much great food and drank so much delicious soju lol

I dont remember the last time I laughed so hard. My cheeks were flushed and I smiled the entire drive home. 

Feeling so grateful for the good people in my life 🥰☺️"
happy,"Five years ago I didn't see a future for myself at all. I was sleeping in my rideshare rental car, was in a crappy part time job that I hated, and was living with severe anxiety. Sixteen months ago, I took a chance and decided to give school another try. Thanks to financial aid and scholarships, tuition assistance from my current job, and support from a lot of people around me, I now have an AA in Political Science and graduated Phi Theta Kappa with honors. I have gotten offers from several schools to transfer/finish my BA, including some really good schools (one is an Ivy League school). I've wanted to move to the East Coast (NYC area) since I was 15 and finally have the opportunity at the end of this year, and will be finishing my BA there. My dream is to become a history teacher; history is AWESOME because it helps us to learn about so many facets of society and humanity, and education is a very noble, yet very under-appreciated field that I wish more people would look into. Learning is magical, and as long as we are alive, we have a chance to learn something new."

happy,"So it started in 2020, We met while playing roblox i
approached her, (yes she was a girl im not gonna namedrop) we played roblox day and night enjoying games, we
chatted in the roblox chat feature whenever we weren't playing some chats lasted 3 hours, it was enjoyable until she stopped chatting, everytimee then we could
only communicate every 1 month and so with such
short messages, Thats when she told me she had a
new account, there is when it started we stopped talking completely- Skip to 2022- she told me her new account
and i understood why we couldnt talk much, and then after a few conversations and games, She disappeared completely i was really worried - Skip to 2023-2024-in 2023 i kept chatting her updating new stuff that happened in my life, i missed her completey even if we are just online friends, shes gone.. One last message in 2024 on january

happy,"It's a new day. I woke up with air in my lungs, a body that can move. The people I love inhabiting this same home with me. They are what makes it home for me. A warm, safe place that I'm heading to for work.

happy,💗
happy,"my boyfriend and i are both 16. were immature, sometimes a little petty, but undoubtedly in love. my mother died before i met him, but since he’s known me he’s supported me through the grief of losing her and even has visited her grave by himself on his own time. he helps me talk about her, and says that he wishes he could have known her. it means more than he knows.

i come from a drug addict mother and angry father, so my model for a relationship wasn’t the best. i’ve messed up with him, i’ve said things i didn’t mean when i was upset, but he’s been nothing but patient with me. he’s taught me how to talk things out and admit when i’m upset about something, and to not harbor my emotions.

he’s making me a better person, and i love him unconditionally. he’s the first person i’ve been comfortable enough to let him see every single side of me, mentally and behaviorally. anyways, just wanted to say there are still good people out there, and everyone deserves someone who treats them the way my boyfriend treats me!! "
happy,"
My parents don’t love me and haven’t for a long time and I’m happy with that. Recently, my parents have shown their true colors to a lot of people, especially me. I’ve come to learn that they have only loved me conditionally, if I provide something to them. They weaponize my siblings against me, try to financially cripple me, and just try to make me feel as bad as possible. Ever since I’ve been sure of what I wanna do for a career, my mother and sister have constantly belittled it. My mother has said that my sister is her favorite and my parents have always shown that for as long as I can remember. I realize now that they don’t love me anymore and I’m happy I can move on with my life. I’ve accepted that they never will for as long as I live, and I can finally grow and surround myself with people who truly love and care about me. "
happy,"I was being intimate with a white guy and I’m an awkward person so I said I had “hair extensions” and he didn’t mind. He didn’t care at all. He treated me like a normal person… he even touched my head gently a couple of times which made my hairstyle a bit messy but nothing bad happened.

I’m young and the reason I wear wigs is I don’t want to hear damage my real hair :3"

L' Amante by Beth Cavener is every bit as beautiful in real life as I could have imagined and I am SO excited to have been able to marvel at it with my own two eyes!"
happy,Let’s go weekend !!
happy,"Just wanted to share this small victory, since im feeling hella good abt it.  
I tried to filter a dataframe for certain items, but it always gave me the code ""undefined columns selected"". I couldn´t solve it for literal DAYS and it really frustrated me to the point of crying.

  
Turns out i just forgot that the items had a headline in the program! So no wonder i defined them wrongly! I forgot that i didn´t turn off the headline while importing the dataset, and that´s why it always gave me that error!

  
I know i´m not a genius, but i feel absolutely undefeatable right now.

Thanks for reading my small vent :)"

happy,"hi- new-ish to reddit but just wanted to say that i’m happy with where i am in life right now. from last august-the end of the year i had no job and bills were draining my savings. 
after spending so much during the holidays, i NEEDED to get a job after the new year. it became my unspoken resolution. so after my guests left, i started applying. 
now, here I am, a SOLID paycheck in. PLUS i’m supporting a super cool small business!
i can’t wait to start saving up again. last year was rough. 
cheers! stay happy!"
happy,"It's been a long time coming. I haven't been able get more than a buzz for about four years now on account of how high my tolerance is. My lungs have begun to protest as well. I've had it in my mind for a while now that I need to take a lengthy tolerance break. Whenever my weed is about to run out I tell myself that this is it and that once it's gone I would begin a several month long break.

What always happens is I will smoke my last bowl and then find myself walking over to the dispensary that's literally a two minute walk away and buying another ounce. Last night I finished smoking my supply and I didn't buy more. I didn't buy any today either. The dispensary closes in 13 minutes and that will make it official.

For the first time in probably five years, I chose not to smoke weed. Tiny milestone, but tomorrow I will abstain again, and the next day, and the next, and the next."
happy,We had a long and semi mild winter but with the freezes and thaws it's taken my garden to bloom any flowers. These daffodils are usually also eaten or picked by my children so this has been so nice to enjoy their beautiful blooms.

happy,"A close encounter of the saintly kind…

…At the grocery store with my daughter. She’s little, so tends to have the “Please, buy me everything!” anytime we’re in the store. Most of the time she’s fine with a “Not today, sweetie.” but today, she was in her feels because ALLLLLLLL of the day-after Valentine’s Day items were smack dab in front of the door when we walked in. She wanted a balloon. Mommy said “Not today, sweetie.” and today, that “not today” didn’t go over very well. She proceeded to be very pouty. Meh, it happens. 

Well, we’re in an aisle looking for artichoke hearts and there stood a kindly, bespectacled, affable looking gentleman. I asked his pardon as we passed. We started making small talk after he tried to engage my daughter and she made it very clear that she wanted a balloon and wasn’t allowed to have one. He laughed and looked at me chuckling. “It doesn’t get easier as they get older!” to which I replied “She’s six… pray for me!” 

The kindly gentleman (before we learned his name) knelt down and said to my daughter “You know… balloons are wonderful, but they are often the best when they’re surprises, so maybe you can look forward to getting one when you least expect it.” This seemed to go over well with my daughter. 

The kindly gentleman (Mr. Myles, I came to know) and I continued chatting about kids, life, and random musings, eventually parting with a genuine sense of happiness over the entire interaction. He proceeded to the front of the store and my daughter and I continued our shopping. 

A few moments later, he found us at the back of the store with a heart shaped balloon. With the biggest smile ever, he handed it to my daughter and said “See? Isn’t it so much better when it’s a surprise?” I was dumbfounded, more tickled pink than I’d been in a while and said “You’re an absolute angel! No wait- a Saint! Thank you Saint Myles!” 

Random acts of kindness are the best. In a world full of curmudgeonly behavior- be like Myles."
happy,Back from a deployment and finally got to take my mom out for a birthday celebration. Long overdue.
happy,"A few weeks ago I won sole custody of my 3 kids from an abusive drug addicted ex. Today she signed the final modification of custody with a notary and everything. Looking forward to moving on and giving my kids the loving home they deserve. It’s taken 3 years, tons of heartbreak and emotions, multiple court appearances and tens of thousands of dollars to get to this point. It’s worth it and you can’t give up! "
happy,"I have been doing this job for couple of months and I have made a very strong bond with some of the kids.
"
happy,"I love my profession but i absolutely hate my job and workplace for a number of reasons that I wont bother talking about. But today was one of those days that people just make me and my heart smile. At my PM shift today a man and two girls (they looked 4 and 6, I was not very sure) came into the pharmacy and handed me one prescription. The smaller one literally said “doctor, you’re so cute” (im not a doctor but i appreciated the compliment). Thought I heard her wrong so I told her to repeat herself and it made me really happy that I giggled under my mask and couldnt stop smiling. While they were waiting for their prescription filled, the older sister said it was cold and the younger offered her jacket and started taking it off and putting it on her which i thought was extremely sweet. They were sitting and talking, their dad just hugging them. When I finally dispensed her medications, the older one said “thank you, bye, cute doctor”. Their dad just laughed at the whole thing but I feel like I have to credit good parenting. This has to be the most wholesome interaction."
happy,"And I rigged it up to open with a fake book. This is something I've always, always wanted, and it makes me ridiculously happy to have finished the project.

happy,Met my bestfriends girlfriend and when we were alone for a little bit she told me “he talks about you all the time and it’s really obvious you mean so much to him and he looks up to you. i’m really glad he has you he needs you”. It just felt so damn good man. Usually it’s people talking bad behind your back but he is praising me to his GIRLFRIEND. I feel so loved man.
happy,"To all my fellow singles out there and to those that are missing/can’t be with their significant other today, remember this:

You have the ability to light your own spark.  We all want that sense of completion with someone else by our side.  We all fantasize about being whole.  The over-commercialization of romantic love makes it even worse. The truth is, we are whole just as we are.  Sure we all come with baggage but that doesn’t make us incomplete.  This is your reminder that you don’t have to go through today feeling alone.  This is your chance to pour all of your love into the most important person in your life: you!

Right now, I’m sitting with a glass of my favorite (Verdi) wine, snuggling with Bruno the stuffed red dragon and my two cats.  I bought myself flowers again this year and added the purple rose because they are my favorite.  I lit my favorite Apotheke candle.  There’s salmon broiling in the oven that I’ll be pairing with  broccoli and basmati rice.  Later, I’ll cuddle under the blankets and watch a movie.  It’s all I’d want to do with a partner.  Why should being single change that?

How are you spending today?  I hope it is filled with peace and not a reminder of what could have/should have been.  Seize your happiness.  You deserve it."
happy,"I’m kinda lonely in college I didn’t find many good friends here throughout the years, I got good friends back home though but kinda sad I can’t spend it with them bc I feel like 21 is kinda special? Maybe? But here’s to another trip around the sun of life 😄"
happy,"I know it’s probably not a crazy good accomplishment; especially because I know I’ve hurt people before, but I’m still proud of myself nonetheless. 

I used to be defensive, snappy, and easy to push into sadness or anger. This was due some previous life experiences. Which doesn’t make it okay. It never does, but I feel like me getting better and being a better friend and person to those around me is a sign that I’m moving on from that. I’m healing. :)

I’ve been in and out of therapy my whole life; which never really worked until I became an adult and was able to truly think for myself and be myself. 
Now; after two years of panic attacks and mental decline, I think I’m finally getting better. I’m kinder, I’m more generous, I’m able to take criticism. I’m still sensitive, but I try to remember the intention of others before reacting in anyway. I’ve also learned to take time for myself incase my emotions get too high. (Something I was INCAPABLE of doing before) 

Okay, sorry for the wall of text; I’m just happy to be doing better. Thank you, if you made it this far. 

Remember to be kind not only to others, but also to yourself. :)"
happy,"Today I (17 m) was home alone and started to take out the ingredients (pasta and frozen cubed chicken) but then I thought f*ck it, imma be brave today and boil frozen meat balls in tomato sauce instead of just heating up the chicken in the microwave. It went much better than the last times, I didn’t even think I  would start a fire, unlike the other times. I’m so proud of myself!"
happy,"My boyfriend and I were cuddling yesterday and he told me he wants to be the father of my kids one day. I’ve always wanted a loving and respectful man who would want something long-term with me and I also aspire to be a mother who raises a cute lil family of my own one day, so I was squealing on the inside when he told me this :) I hope everyone and anyone can experience love as amazing as this if not better 🥰"
happy,"I was a mess for two decades, booze, coke, just whatever. I have now made it two years without a drink or any coke. I'm so happy right now. I was able to go back to school and I went from a 36 waist to a 30. I later gave up sodas and energy drinks, but alcohol was the tough one. Two years!!!"
happy,"awww, thank you to whoever gave me gold! 


I'm trying to respond to everyone because I love you all for taking the time to comment."
happy,"I have sensory issues and I can't drive because I have epilepsy, so I was looking for a work from home job and I found a job for data entry. It's pretty easy so far according to the training assessments I was given and I start tomorrow. I'm so excited! It's been a few years since I've had a job. I have a 2mo old my husband makes good money but I am beyond excited! This is honestly such a blessing"
happy,"I got the Sony WH-1000XM4’s and they’re so amazing. The sound quality is so nice and I can’t get over the noise cancellation feature. Everything is so quiet and I feel so much calmer. Noises put me on edge sometimes when I’m overwhelmed (often), so they have just helped a lot. :D"
happy,Let’s go weekend !!
happy,"Got my dog a toy today at a local ranch supply store. This was supposed to be the be all end all toy for destructive dogs. She managed to tear chunks out of it in 5 minutes flat. I wrote the company and said nice try, but it just didn't hold up. Company wrote back and said that only about 5% of dogs globally could defeat their rubber toys. As my puppy was one of those 5%, would I allow her to become a tester for their company? Heck yes, I'll let her do that. Whether they pay me, or whether they just send free toys, it's still a win for me and my American Bully XL.

ETA, this was an off brand toy, not the well known super duty one."
happy,"I recently met someone. Our first date was during the work week, we met for drinks and ended up talking for 6 hours! Our second date was yesterday. It was so nice. We had ice cream and  went to the museum. He’s smart and funny. Artistic and creative. We had great conversation and he was a complete gentleman. He texted today and asked to go on a proper dinner date. 
I’m looking forward to seeing where this could go. ☺️ "
happy,"The last time I had one I was 8, it lasted 2years and I always wanted to try VTT. Always wanted my own bike to move to to work ect I am proud of myself"
happy,I was able to buy the house mostly using money my mother left after she passed away.  And I think she'd be proud and happy knowing the hard work she put in while she was alive helped give me a new chance.  She always wanted me to live happy and now I am.
happy,"My boyfriend and I were cuddling yesterday and he told me he wants to be the father of my kids one day.

happy,"Backstory: my grandfather played for Ike & Tina Turner in the 60’s. He “retired” from playing about 12 years ago, but tonight I convinced him to play one last time to end 2023. 
The sax he’s playing is a Buescher Aristocrat built in 1949 that was purchased for him by his father. He gifted me the saxophone for my 26th birthday & I start lessons next week. 
I’m infinitely proud of him & have some big shoes to fill. Happy New Year! 🎉"
happy,"Are they enough?

I moved away from family and friends to another state over 1000 miles away. It’s just my husband, two dogs and me. I work from home. I’m 52 years old and it’s hard to make friends at this age. Is it wrong that I feel content and dare I say happy with the limited companionship? Social media tells me I should have friends to hang out with on a weekly basis. 

I like hanging out at home with my pups and husband. I read and garden. We have fires and cocktails. 

Am I missing out? Should I be trying harder? I do go back “home” twice a year to see family and one or two friends."
happy,"Whether it's a big life success or just taking time to look at the daisies, I want to hear about what's made you smile and feel happy to be here. This is a great place to get some celebration for your successes or have someone share in your joy."
happy,"

I guess I'm just trying to put some good vibes for myself out on a night where I feel rather low. I honestly didn't think I could get this far but since February I've lost 32lbs according to my scale this morning. It's probably more once I poop...if I poop."
happy,This is my cat Hopper. He’s a pretty rad and chill cat and really just likes to hang out with his people. The lil dude doesn’t know it but he makes me very happy and life would be boring without him. 
happy,"Told myself on Halloween night of 2022 it was time for a change. 12/1/2022 318 lbs, 5/28/2023 285 lbs, 5/28/2024 163 lbs."
happy,"I’m nervous but also really proud of myself because I made a doctors appointment and I haven’t been in five or six years because we don’t have public transpertation in my town, I can’t drive and people that could drive me always had something going on, also I have some pretty bad phone anxiety. I have no idea what I’ll need to do, because its been so long, and even before than it had been another five or so years, so I’m at a lost, but super excited that I’m finally getting things done."
happy,"Yesterday, a mysterious someone left this poster and a bucket of flowers. The number of people walking around with flowers was astounding. Plenty of folks in my hometown needed a little happiness. :)"
happy," I am starting at a university this semester and I applied for financial aid, and I got it to cover school for this semester but they will also send me a refund via paper check. The amount is more money than I have ever had in my life and I am so freaking happy! I have had half of that amount before but never that much like ever. I am so excited! Also since I got a Pell Grant my textbooks and materials are covered so no need to worry about those! I can use this money to buy whatever I want! I do need my own place though I might look into that, but everything is freaking expensive! I will definitely buy a PS5 and a new laptop at least, since I need a new computer for school rather than my ancient Macbook. I wish I had direct deposit on it instead of the paper check. I will also need to find a check cashing place to cash it since I do not have a real bank account anymore. I will figure it out. I just cannot WAIT to have that check in my hand though! 9 more business days to go lol. "
happy,"I'm a 30yr old woman and I've never really played with Legos before. My husband is an avid Lego lover, both as a kid and as an adult, and has recently wanted to get back into building them. 

I know there have been some really cool sets to come out in the past couple of years (some look like flowers or little zen gardens or insects one might pin, etc) so when he got himself a set today I also looked. I found this darling little bonsai tree and he offered to get it for me so we could build together! 

We both put ours together tonight and it was so much fun! I didn't realize that the cherry blossoms were actually little pink frogs until I got to that section. My little bonsai is chilling with its adorable little pink frogs on my counter and I could not be more pleased!

And for anyone wondering, hubby got himself the Thanos glove and he is pleased as punch! 😊"
happy,"Im 17F, a highschool senior, the past year I’ve been doing an engineering internship at a different company that sells stuff that refineries and other companies buy, including this company. I also placed 3rd at a state drafting competition. My school guidance counselor got an email from this refinery saying they saw my accomplishments in the newspaper and are offering me an internship.

HOLY SHIT THIS IS MASSIVE. THIS PLACE IS NOTORIOUS FOR BEING DIFFICULT TO GET INTO!! AND IM NOT EVEN IN COLLEGE EITHER!!!! I AM ACTUALLY SO HAPPY. 

I don’t know what exactly I did to get this, BUT IM NOT COMPLAINING YIPPEEEEEE"
happy,"I had a girl I’ve been dating over for dinner and drinks last night to celebrate NYE.  Things started getting physical so I suggested going to the bedroom.  It was a hard no.

I was a little bit puzzled (we’ve had sex before).  She then informs me she has her period, appears visibly upset and apologizes.  I sort of start laughing; now she looks puzzled.

I tell her I’m chuckling at the apology; there is absolutely no reason to be sorry and I couldn’t be happier just giving her a kiss at midnight and waking up beside her tomorrow (she’s never spent the night).  I offer her a heating pad, pillows and to run out to grab some midol; whatever she needs to be comfortable, she need only let me know.

The result was a lovely young lady, stunned by the thoughtfulness and filled with appreciation.  Though I invited a ‘date’ over for dinner, we decided to become exclusive and I woke up beside my new ‘girlfriend’ the next morning.

What a great start to 2022.

Edit: inclusion of exclusivity."
happy,"After long hard months of grinding applications, interviews and dealing with the anxiety that comes along with it I have finally received a job offer from a company that I really like.

I know these moments of happiness are short lived, but this is one of the bigger milestones I’ve achieved in my life and I am extremely proud of myself.

Always remember that if you are willing to work hard enough to achieve something that it is always possible! Don’t give up!"
happy,"I’m a 20 year old in my last year of college and for a long time I was so confused as to what I wanted to do with my communications degree. I did a few internships which I hated and had no idea how I was going to cope working in a place I hate for the next 50 years. 

Now, by a chance opportunity, I started a new job alongside my studies for a company in an industry that I love to death (it’s a type of sports). 

I love the people I work with, my office is super nice, and the work is really interesting and fulfilling. I’m actually genuinely excited to grow and learn and forge my career and I am so grateful for the opportunity! 

"
happy,"A few weeks ago I won sole custody of my 3 kids from an abusive drug addicted ex. Today she signed the final modification of custody with a notary and everything. Looking forward to moving on and giving my kids the loving home they deserve. It’s taken 3 years, tons of heartbreak and emotions, multiple court appearances and tens of thousands of dollars to get to this point. It’s worth it and you can’t give up! "
happy,"I (25m) am in a relationship for the first time in my adult life and can not describe how happy I am.

Towards the end of October last year my boss told me that one of my co-workers (23f) who I did also consider a friend had told her she had a crush on me. I admitted that while I had never really considered it before, if she was interested I was willing to give it a go. We started flirting and a couple weeks later we had our first date. 

The funny part is that at the beginning of January my now girlfriend and I were talking and it came out that while we were definitely friends rather than just co-workers at the time, neither of us had considered a romantic relationship until our boss told us both that the other was interested and we realized that our boss had just been bored and decided to play matchmaker. We have since confronted our boss and thanked her for doing what she did.

We are both incredibly happy with our situation now and incredibly grateful to our bored meddling boss for setting us up (and creating two incredibly inefficient employees)."
happy,"My boyfriend and I almost always play pool during our lunch break, more often than not betting something per game. Well, the bet we're cashing in this weekend is something I'm really looking forward to! We're gonna lay out blankets and pillows galore in the living room, introduce him to Star Wars for May 4th, order some ramen, snuggle puddle with my bunny (he loves my bf), and add pictures to our lovey dovey scrapbook.   
  
This man is so sweet, I'm truly able to let out my hopeless romantic side with him and get it right back without hesitation. Not to mention I just renewed my lease and we added his name to it! Having a safe and healthy love is one of the greatest feelings in the world. I love and adore him, and feel so giddy knowing he's just as crazy about me, too. :)"
happy,"This is a long, very happy rant. I can't rant out of happiness this hard to anyone in my life rn

I am so happy. I can't stop talking about my glasses and it's probably getting annoying, because everyone has glasses. But I feel like a lot of people just got glasses when they first started needing them and didn't just have terrible vision that was ignored for most of their lives to the point of developing eye problems over it, and then suddenly get it corrected like in an instant, and I literally cannot shut up about it. What I thought was pretty normal vision was actually complete dogshit and now I am seeing things I couldn't even imagine a few weeks ago.

And holy shit. I pretty much immediately got hit with the heavy fist of depth perception for the first time in my life and spent like half an hour touching the sink and putting my hands in the corners of the room because everything was suddenly EXTREMELY 3D. I feel like I am in an actual video game. I used to joke that video games are higher definition than my actual vision but not right now.

Everything is so BRIGHT. Everything is so DETAILED. Grass doesn't all blend together anymore, everything on my shelf is a distinct individual object, I can see a face a few feet away, hell I can read something across the street. It's nuts. Colours are so sharp and saturated now, life isnt a foggy haze around me, everything is in such intense focus and detail I keep just staring at little things and tearing up. 

AND I CAN ACTUALLY READ OH MY GOD. I've been afraid to Crack open a novel because I'm afraid it's going to be too good to be true, but as far as scrolling on my phone, sentences and words are so crisp and distinct. I don't have to hold it at right up to my actual nose, close one eye and squint just to have my eye bounce all over the page and give me a headache after about one sentence. 

And better, I haven't had double vision in days. I used to get it every day like clockwork around 2pm until the end of the day. Since putting on my glasses, I guess my brain just. Isn't trying to mash together two extremely different visual fields anymore and giving up or something (I'm not a doctor, that makes sense to me though)

I'm just losing my mind. I never want to take them off. I have to force myself to take them off at bedtime. I want to order 500 pairs and put them on a special shelf like a shrine lol. I have never been more greatful for anything before.

It's insane how bad I let this get under the guise of ""it's always been like this, it was like this when I grew up, can't imagine it gets that much better than this now."" It's like the Crack in your windshield that you eventually stop noticing until your windshield explodes."
happy,My derpy boy also loves me unconditionally and if he loves me I can love myself like my cat loves me.
happy,"Howdy y'all,

A little background: so I'm autistic with a few special interests, e.g. history, aviation, and hot dogs (that one's not important, but still hot dogs are awesome, fight me lol)

Today is not my birthday, but as I'm in the middle of a grueling job search, my friends thought it important to take me out early to both cheer me up and ensure I had a day off.

That is what I assumed, at least!

Turns out these absolute a-holes tricked me and treated me to a lovely day around the city enjoying my favorite things. We went and had a fabulous breakfast before jumping ship to an aviation museum, then enjoying a day by the beach in a more touristy spot of my city before finally going to an art museum styled after a Roman Villa (the Getty Villa in Los Angeles, I highly recommend if you're ever out this way)

Now, I had a blast, but as it turns out, they had one more surprise for me.

A plane ticket to Rome with complete reservations for accommodations!

I'm having a panic attack. I don't know how to respond. I don't know how to pay them back. I'm so incredibly lucky! What could I have possibly done to deserve any of this?!"
happy,I absolutely love pineapple and strawberries! I buy them precut because it’s time consuming but one day I was rambling with my mom complaining about how expensive it is to buy precut fruits so she took it upon herself to buy some pineapples and cut them up and wash the strawberries! ☺️ I’ll finish them in like 2 days lol
happy,"I think I may have perfected my winged liner on slightly hooded eyes! And I tried out a purple liner which makes my brown eyes pop, especially the hazel and green flecks. Just super excited about it and wanted to share!"
happy,"How old were you when you passed your road test? I am 20 years old and about to turn 21 next month, and I passed just yesterday morning! I have my driver’s license! 🚗🎉😄"
happy,Today I found out that I passed my Calc II exam with an 88%! I’m happy that I got that high of a score!
happy,"To start off, im on mobile so excuse me if this is all over the place. I have known my boyfriend for a little over a year. I’ve always found the concept of “love at first sight” ridiculous, but let me tell you, something about him just kept reeling me in the moment i’ve laid eyes on him. We’ve had a very rocky relationship (more of a situationship for the most part), a lot of mistakes were made. We’ve hurt each other so many times, we kept trying to cut contact but we both just couldn’t stay away from each other. When we finally re-united for the last time this summer, we had a very open and honest conversation about everything that happened so far. Since then everything has just been perfect. I cannot tell you how perfect this man is. Of course we still have arguments or tense moments, but overall everyday of my life feels like the best day when he’s by my side. I would’ve never imagined that i would love another human being this much. He is the kindest, the most thoughtful soul i’ve ever met. I must admit, i can be a very childish and difficult person sometimes, however he is so so patient with me… More patient than i am with myself. I love him, i love him so much that it pours out of me. It pours on the way i view life, the way i view myself, onto my friends and family, onto strangers i cross paths with, onto everything. He makes everything so much better. I do not know if this is how love is or if it’s unhealthy, but i do know that i am so very greatful to have him in my life. I felt i had to share this to get it out of my chest, thank you if you’ve read all of this yappin’. 🫶🏻"
happy,"
At school I hated working, would much rather be playing sports or video games. Throughout uni whilst I found some topics interesting, I hated any hard graft, would much rather be lounging about. I had kind of just accepted that I would forever just do my job to get paid then rush home at the end of the day. 

My first couple jobs were very much like that. I was there for a pay check, would not spend a second more than I needed to there. 

I’ve just had an incredibly busy/tiring/stressful week, and as I sit slumped on the sofa watching a film I find myself somewhat looking forward to Monday and to getting stuck right back into it? This is a completely alien concept for me and I’m not sure how to process it. I’m incredibly thankful and I just kind of wanted to get it off my chest without appearing like bragging to my friends. 

A) what do I do with this good energy? Do I just accept that I’m lucky and crack on?

B) I wanna hear about others that love their job- not the money or how easy it is, who really loves putting in effort and showing up Monday morning? And to those people how do I stay like this? I don’t want to get burned out I want to be happy going to work when I’m 60"
happy,"I was stopping by to make another donation, and it just made me so happy to see! She looked so happy holding and petting that little plushie, and it felt really good knowing that it went to someone who would love and cherish it far more than I ever did."
happy,Cheers!
happy,"Told myself on Halloween night of 2022 it was time for a change. 12/1/2022 318 lbs, 5/28/2023 285 lbs, 5/28/2024 163 lbs."

I found out a lot about myself during this year because of reddit and people here.

thank you all, folks!"
happy,"I want to reciprocate with a meal subscription because he eats to live on weekdays(mainly due to work) but I want to change things up so ideas are welcome! Also, how do people keep the sparks alive when they are physically away from their partners? "
happy,"So I've worked for getting on 6 years now 

Been senior support for about 3-4 years. Which involves working 24 hour shifts 

For the last year or so I've been doing a lot of the manager work without the extra pay, this is because the current deputy was not really able to do the tasks 

Well I was having a bit of a moan over the Easter bank holidays because I had finished three 24 hour shifts when the regional manager started sending me a series of tasks for some reason (my bosses boss) and I did it all promptly while moaning at myself for being a push over 

Turns out the regional manager then asked my boss why I'm not the deputy as I seem better for the role.

This lead to a discussion with the current deputy who said that she is more than happy to step down from the position for me to take over 


So I'm happy to have gotten recognition from someone high up the chain but also I will now only be working one 24 hour shift a week and will have 16 hours office hours throughout the week 

Also I still get a pay rise of course aha "
happy,It's Spring! I am so happy when I hear the birds and frogs on my walk to work.
happy,I've literally been praying for this for two years straight ever since the post-credits scene in Sonic Movie 2. The fact that this is actually happening after all that is so blissful
happy,"I love people. I find it so fascinating how incredibly intricate every single person is, and there’s billions of us! I genuinely love seeing people walking outside or at school. I’m excited to see my friends, yes, but I also love the fact that I get to see everyone else’s faces every day. I’ve never really empathized with those that say they hate the majority of people. I get being hurt and losing the ability to trust, I can understand it, but I don’t think I could really just hate people in general. I love people’s faces, not just the eyes, but the noses and the smiles and the way skin crinkles. I get so excited at the prospect of meeting new people, because that’s one more entire life I get to interact with! That person an entire world of inner thought and experiences that is allowing me to take part in their experience of the world. Idk I just really love people a whole lot."
happy,"It took a lot of saving, moving things around financially, and sacrificing. I’m looking to improve my finances (and my life) in the future, but it’s good to have hope for once. Really was worried I’d miss the deadline. 

Sorry, I known I’ve been a problem , and I have no one who really cares enough in my life to share this with. Thank you guys for allowing me."
happy,"Even in the middle of the storm, there are small places to breath"
happy,"So basically I (20 M) have lost a shit ton of weight from say weighing 120 kilograms to right now weighing 83 kgs. I regularly go to the gym and I have them muscles too. There's just one teeny tiny issue. I was a hell of a glutton when I was chubby, and that habit still persists in the form of my sweet tooth and binge eating, though not often. 
Today, particularly, I'd eaten more than I'm supposed to, on my calorie deficit, by say 200-300 kcals, and all the PTSD came rushing to my head. I know it's not healthy, but this does not happen often. Okay so, my girlfriend rudely cut my video call cause her friend called and the girls had a nice time putting on face masks and stuff (when my girl (19 F) had told me before that she would do that with me on video call, while we talk.) So obviously this made me feel bad, and along with the PTSD, made my emotions avalanche down the fkin mountain. 
Cue me calling my girl a bit later, she goes ""tell me what's the matter"" in the most bored voice ever. I couldn't stop myself, tears started flowing down my eyes. I didn't know how to tell her what the matter was, and that made my emotions plummet even more.
However, after a while, I gathered composure, told my girlfriend the reasons, that I missed my father, and my grandmothers every single day, think about the days they were alive, and that I get motivation from them, to succeed. I told her about the PTSD regarding my body image issues, and what I consider as freedom from this: I want to be able to rip of my shirt and wear shorts without worrying about my physique whatsoever. (Not to mention I want that athletic physique and am working towards it). 
Where I knew that I'd won, with her as my girlfriend, is when she listened through everything, then at the end, told me stuff I exactly wanted to hear. That how she'd shown a pump picture of mine to one of her guy friends and how the guy praised my physique, how she'd storied a picture of me with a beautiful Persian cat (she was absolutely wonderful, the cat) on instagram, and how her friend replied ""Where were such beautiful and wonderful guys when I was searching for them? What kinda black magic did you perform that suddenly you get such a great guy to be your boyfriend?"". I feel absolutely elated right now.
There was this day I wore a semi-transparent shirt out, and my girl said today: listen babe, yk, I know we went to a temple that day but I could not help thinking unholy shit to do to you.
I am so fucking happy right now. i hope I marry this girl someday."
happy,"I spent all of February in rehab for alcohol. I spent 6 months in a homeless shelter, got my CDL, picked out a company of my choosing, bout to be an uncle 3 times over, and recently celebrated 7 months sober! This is the first time in 6 years I’ve been truly happy. If you’re having a hard time feel free to contact me, I’d love to chat!"
happy,"So today was garbage collection day in my neighborhood and my usual routine is walk out to my backyard, unlock the gate to my backyard, walk out to my front yard and collect the trash can, roll back the trash can back to the gate of my backyard, open the gate to my backyard, roll the trash can through the gate into my backyard, close the gate, but today life had other plans for me. To preface this, the lock on the gate to my backyard is an old fashioned hook where you close the gate and push the hook through it.

I observed the garbage truck collecting my trash at around 01:15 PM today and decided to just collect the trash can now so I don't have to do it later at night. There was heavy gusts of wind and a violent rainpour but I just decided to push through it. I opened the door to my backyard and sprinted through my backyard like an olympian while enjoying the feeling of the wind blowing against my hair and the free shower from the water droplets. I unlocked my backyard gate and sprinted across my front yard to get the trash can and begin rolling the trash can across my front yard to finally get this mundane task over with. I approached the gate to my backyard ready to open it and finish this chore once and for all.

That's when life threw a wrench in my plans. I pushed against the gate to my backyard. It didn't bulge. I pushed again. It didn't bulge. That's when I realized that as I was rolling the trash can across my front yard to the gate of my backyard, the violent gusts of wind of the ongoing storm had blown the gate to my backyard shut and the hook lock to cover it as well. The front door was locked. I had no other way into my house other than the door to my backyard, but that was closed off due the gate being locked. Mind you, I didn't even have my phone, so I couldn't call for help if anything else went awry. That's when a lightbulb shined brightly over my head.

I pushed the trash can in front of the gate to my backyard. I climbed on top of my trash can, it took me 2 tries. Once on top, I looked down and just braced myself for the inevitable, the call of the void. I jumped over the fence and dropped down. It was a 5 foot drop. My legs didn't break fortunately. I unlocked the gate to my backyard and rolled in my trash can. The mundane task was done. I hope none of my neighbors saw me jumping over my own fence and call the cops on me. It looks truly suspicious from an outsider's perspective. Maybe next time I'll put a brick or something in the doorway so it doesn't shut out on me completely. This entire ordeal lasted 8 minutes, and it was the longest 8 minutes of my life.

At least I got my cardio in today. I can't wait to do this chore again in a week and see what happens. I'm coming to an action movie near you. Until then, have a nice day! This is JNORJT, signing off."
happy,First week of college my girlfriend broke up with me because she wanted to hookup with a guy she met in class after begging me to come to college with her and being in a relationship with her for a year she successfully hooked up with him and kept me on the ropes for 7 whole months and I developed a pill addiction and asked her for help with it but she didn’t care a month ago I ended things with her it was then she realized she threw me away and took me for granted for that long and wants me back but I know after what she did to me I can’t go back it’s been a month now and I’m very happy I’m talking to a new lady rn and things are going good but why do I feel guilty ending things with her ?
happy,Back from a deployment and finally got to take my mom out for a birthday celebration. Long overdue.
happy,"With things as grim as they've been the last few years, I decided I'd get a bit of summer work last year while I was off uni so I could fund a long weekend on the seaside after, as well as a trip to Berlin I'm looking to do with my friends this summer. To cut a long story short, I got a job at uni working in the applicant call centre, where people who were meant to be joining this year could phone up and make enquiries.

A-level results day (I'm from the UK) rolls around and sure enough we get a load of people calling up who've not had the right grades for the course they wanted. Basically, the process is that we ask them for their grades, look up what other relevant courses they'd be eligible for, then forward them on to the department if there's space and they're interested. We have one option called a Foundation Year, where you only need a CDD or something like that to be eligible. You basically do a year of baseline work in your subject area to show that you're competent, then you can go on to do the course you originally wanted.

I took 90-something calls that day, and referred about ten or so people on for foundation years, along with a small handful of other people for other courses. I worked about 12 hours that day, and so I went for a pint afterwards to unwind. I remembered a couple of years prior when a friend of mine didn't get the grades he needed and had to call up the uni, so I've seen how hopeless people can feel when they have to do it. While I was drinking, I had this realisation that, thanks to my intervention, those people were able to still find a way into the uni they wanted to be at. I hadn't had a great past year at uni myself, and so I felt like I'd actually served a purpose that day for the first time in ages"
happy,"I've always had trouble finding jeans or any kind of pants for most my life. I was either way too skinny or, after I started body building, my thighs were too big. No matter what though, the waist band was always waaaay too loose. 

Today I tried curvy fit jeans, I wish I had tried years sooner. They look so good on me!!! They fit just right. I always have to settle for the loose waistband. Not today!

The only unlucky part is I'm back down to a 00 pant size... Very hard to find on sale racks or in stores."
happy,I wish I was this good at waiting 
happy,"Made lunch clearly not fancy lol. But lovely to feel mentallyand physically okay to and wanted to after a awful time and physical pain and as he always makes me gorgeous food, proud of him and its a sunny day ❤️"
happy,So today I went for a run. Now when I starred I was doing interval training which I still do but today I made through half my route without getting winded or slowing down to walk. I feel amazing. I'm so happy when I make progress. 
happy,"A while ago I wanted to download a game from my childhood because I remember really liking the music. I'm waaay too old for anything in it of course and don't have kids but I wrote a review baisicly saying that it made my childhood and that even though I've grown out of it I still adore it. I checked today and found out that the creator of the game wrote back a review saying ""We were so pleased! We are extremely glad that we brought happiness to your childhood! This is our goal! Thank you very much for these words on behalf of the whole team! Be healthy!"" (Translated from bulgarian). Actually crying tears of joy this was so sweet."
happy,"I have been with this amazing, amazing Turkish girl since the 17th of September last year, and she hasn't done anything but making me feel loved, happy, and very confident of my future. My Damla is very lively, and to my ears, she has the most beautiful laughter that I have ever heard.
I am very thankful for the night that we told each other the ""I love you"", and so thankful for her existance in my life."
happy,"Basically the title but my mum recently bought us tickets to see Hozier when he comes to Australia and she’s now teaching herself the lyrics to all his songs so she can sing along, what makes this better is that English is not her first language and she keeps asking me what some words mean so she can fully understand what his songs are about."
happy,"
So I’ve officially made it a month away from drinking and about 2 months away from morphine. And considering all the shit I’ve been through recently and the fact I was drinking a handle of vodka every school week and every weekend for over a year I am incredibly proud of myself for not relapsing. I went from chugging my last drink in last then 30 seconds to only smoking an 8th in like a week. I’m also kinda happy cuz I just turned 16 and now I don’t have to worry about me being stupid and trying to drink and drive. Honestly all of this only happened because my girl didn’t like me when I was  drunk. and considering I’m not the only one in my family who has had a drinking problem and I’ve seen how alcohol ruined my grandparents marriage and eventually led to my grandfathers death at 45 I honestly feel kinda strong for once."

happy,"We found out she had uterine cancer last week, and they scheduled her for a hysterectomy immediately. She had surgery this morning, and it went great. Minimum blood loss, no sign of cancer. I'm so relieved I can't even tell you. Best day of my life."
happy,That's all.
happy,Soooo satisfying

I'm trying to respond to everyone because I love you all for taking the time to comment."
happy,"And, on top of that, we are both now throwing hard enough that the ball makes that wonderfully satisfying sound when hitting the glove.  Today is a good day."
happy,I've been exercising and training everyday. I reach one goal and improved on another. Every morning I do fourty sit ups. Now I get the fourty in but I have to usually do them I sets of ten or take a break. Today I did a complete set of fourty with no breaks all one set so I'm very happy about that. Also yesterday in my running I went further than usual and was less winded. I run in intervals so I was less winded in intervals. So I'm very happy about those things.
happy,"[unrelated image]
Hi, i just got in high school last week and I didn't know anyone except for a friend of mine that ended up on the same school as me. A friend of her  also ended up there (wich i didn't know until yesterday). I just think it's worth to say that my social skills are terrible (expected from a reddit user lol), and i just find so difficult to start conversations, meeting people and stuff like that. On the first week i was dead silent, didn't talk to anyone, i was too shy and embarrassed, and felt like i would be a inconvenience to anyone just trying to stay in peace. Then yesterday (second week already), that friend of mine and her friend were talking to each other and they came to my desk to say something, and just stayed there for the rest of the lunch break, and we talked for a while until the class resumed. But today was even cooler, some of the teachers didn't show up on class, and we just talked the entire time about our lives. And believe it or not, it gets even cooler: we live in the same region, so we get the same buses on our way to home, and guess what: we talked the entire way lol. It just feels so nice to have someone to talk with that isn't on the internet, i was really missing that in-person social interactions haha.
Anyway, i think I've never typed so much in english, I hope only the best for y'all, cya ;P"
happy,"My dad and his girlfriend probaply tought that i needed a younger sibling to get my s*** together lol i visited them every weekend she didn't complain when i said that i wanted to change diapers ""oh yeah? go for it sweetie"" god i can still smell the 💩 lol"
happy,"Throughout my life I have dealt with a series of health problems and that caused me to be very lethargic. Been to hospital and so on many times. Mainly stuff with my ovaries, kidneys, and liver.  

One thing that made me upset a bit was when I was 17 and attempted to donate blood, but was just not able to due to my condition and problems in general.

Today after dealing with going to the doctors pretty much once a month last year I was finally eligible to donate and so I signed up and did so. 

Happened only a few hours ago and I feel great! Before when I used to get blood drawn for example for medical reasons I would get very nauseous and faint just due to how my health was. Feels strange not feeling that way despite the donation being more blood."
happy,"Thrilled to be in our new house!  We've been in an apartment for the last 5 years.  Today, I'm opening moving boxes, cleaning...and turning up the music as LOUD as I want!  I've been waiting for this for so long!!

happy,"I've been so depressed the last few months because of an incident I don't want to go into. Its been a long time since I've felt genuine happiness but today is just the perfect day. I feel so relaxed, as if all my problems just went away. There's a really nice sunset out (if only there was a few extra degrees so I could sit out on my balcony), and I'm listening to my favorite tracks on my phone. Usually those things are more of a treatment, but today its a cure. 








I feel free for the first time in so long. I wish this feeling on everyone"
happy,"We've been dating for a little over a month now and she just called me babe. No other petnames were used prior to this.

I'm giggling and kicking my feet and even after sending a string of keyboard smashes and I love you's I'm giddy and need to tell somebody. Thanks for listening. I love her very much.

happy,"Just remember guys there are good things and people in the world, you just gotta find them :) thank you couple wherever you are now!"
happy,"There wasn't anything special about it really. I just got back from helping my partner move a 9 hour drive away to school. I was driving back feeling very lonely, thinking about a lot of things, life in general. Called various family members and caught up with them. I finally made it home, got settled and took inventory of the food situation. Lots of ancient leftovers in the fridge. I made the ground turkey into taco meat, got the standard fixings together on the tortillas...

My God it was magical. Sometimes you feel like you need a good cry but then you have a good taco and everything is okay and you realize you don't need to cry. The universe put you right where you belong. You are strong. Things are pretty damn good and you get to live a very nice life.

I hope you all have a great night!

happy,"So I just impulsively bought train tickets to visit my boyfriend tomorrow! I had a few off days in work but the plane ticket was too expensive, so instead I bought the train tickets which will take around 10 hours to his city, nevertheless I bought it and by the time he’ll be finished with his job, he will see me waiting in front of his office which he has no idea about ! I can’t sleep thinking I’ll get to see him tomorrow and what kind of reaction he’ll be having ! Just today he was complaining that I came for only 4 days previous month & it’s not enough, we should be together more often and stuff! The train is really early in the morning and I should sleep but I can’t! I’m so happy and excited ! "

I've also decided to switch to weekly updates, as I don't want to clog r/happy with just my posts. It's just not fair to other posters. 

I love y'all and if you need anything, a pep talk, walking advice, or just wanna talk please feel free to DM me, as I'm alwaysore than happy to talk. Cheers!"

happy,"Not only was I drinking out of despair for my unfortunate life, but I was making my life more unfortunate with drinking. I was depressed. Couldn’t hold a job. Was in debt. Unhealthy life habits and terribly unhealthy, both physically and mentally. Had toxic friendships and relationships. Deep down I hated myself and thought it was the life I deserved, and I couldn’t ever live a happy life. 9 months ago I decided to change that. My whole life has turned around! I’ve lost weight, am finally experiencing true happiness, have a wonderful partner and meaningful relationships, am constantly working on making my self and life better, and may even be able to retire before I hit 30.  Oh, and I am nearly 3 months sober of weed as well!!!!

Today is such a good day. "
happy,"The dress was 2 sizes smaller than her body shape, and then, today was the day, pure happiness in her face, I'm so happy and proud of her 🥹❤️"
happy,"These past few days, my boyfriend and I have been spending a lot of time on calls, sharing what our everyday lives look like. Since then, I have learned a lot about him: he hates when people eat messy stuff in his car, he likes a slightly messy room but not too much, and he really thinks it's important to have a cup holder when you're drinking in bed. But most importantly, when he sleeps, he snores a little bit. It's the cutest thing I've ever heard in my whole life. Maybe I'm just so in love, but hearing him sleep like that, with his little sounds, makes my heart so fuzzy. I love every little thing about him, every little quirk."

happy,"After 3-4 years of increasing exercise intolerance, I was diagnosed with a heart problem (SVT) 3 months ago. I'm only 40. At the time I could barely walk for 5 minutes. After medication I was up to 15 minutes walking in December. On Saturday, I completed a 2 mile walk outside (normally a big migraine trigger)! I haven't felt this good in 18 years! And the walk was for migraine awareness and education, so I learned about advocacy programs! This is a huge accomplishment for me and I am so incredibly happy. I'm actually tearing up just thinking about it! Now I can work on weight loss and socialize more, it's been absolutely life-changing."
happy,"
I've been in a really good mood lately. 

I just had a woman hit on me for the first time ever the other day. I was super nervous, but it left me feeling amazing.

And recently I've somehow (through no real effort on my part) managed to become surrounded by very thoughtful, kind, and genuine people.

I've felt more at ease with my life in general.

It almost feels like my world turned around on it's own, and it brought a lot of joy into my life."

happy,"Today's been a really lovely. I felt so at peace handwashing antique quilts in textile cleaner to remove the yellow age stains so they become like new again, just a couple spots need to be patched up and already have some choice fabrics in mind (got some really nice cotton calico prints at a free sale a couple years ago and a few nice quilt squares at a church sale). Save that project for a rainy day. Went out to some yard sales today and got some nice antique furniture for really cheap and some work clothes. I love looking at how they joined wood furniture back then, no nails or screws, just complex wood joinery and yet it's so unbelievably sturdy. The solid cedar wardrobe needs to be stripped, sanded and stained with a wood oil but it's lovely and has a cute little mirror and hanger and everything. I really loved how helpful the gentleman selling it was too. He helped carry the furniture into my vehicle and he just seemed really kind and gentle. His mum raised him right. Something about this being his mum's furniture is bittersweet. That's the wonderful thing about these older pieces, they're loved and I hope whoever takes on these pieces after me, loves them equally as much. I do wonder sometimes who the craftsman is behind all of this. It's kind of paying tribute to his art and how it carries on after death. 😊🥰"
happy,Been slightly over 2 and a half years sober but my third birthday sober...working towards my third year this August and this pupper means the world to me. Hes my little buddy and I owe him so much.

happy,"My parents and grandparents gave me a surprise party for my birthday (not too far from now) and almost all my friends were there, including one that is like an older sister to me. They got me the best gifts I could ever ask for. I'm over the  moon and so grateful for them, and, honestly, I forgot the party was technically about me because I was busy thinking about them and how happy they've made me.

When I got there it was loud but the music was good, after a while we then got food that was absolutely delicious 😋, It was Spaghetti, garlic bread, and fried chicken, plus a salad and a cup of apple juice :D, I ate and had fun talking to my friend and when we left we got Starbucks, me and my friend listened to music for the rest of the car ride to my home. I’m now home and I just really wanted to share what happened today, Sadly this was the first year I didn’t celebrate Easter with a Easter egg hunt but I still had just as much of a good time as the other past years :)

Be Happy guys 😁🙌❤️"
happy,"I was accepted by my top choice college a couple of hours ago, and I'm really excited!! It's not selective whatsoever - the acceptance rate is around 85%, but I was still really nervous. My GPA isn't the greatest - only around 2.9 at the time of admission, because I had a rough sophomore year and was out of school due to an eating disorder and was in a treatment center hours from my home. I will never be able to fully explain to anyone how awful and scary that experience was for me. It's amazing because that really felt like the end of the world, and to see now that I have a lot more to do in my life feels super weird (but good!). I worked my ass off this past semester and scored a 28 on my ACT, and I can finally say I'm kind of proud of myself."

He is the strongest man I have ever met, I admire and look up to him more than he knows. We passed our one year recently and my love for him still grows day by day. The world seems so colorful with meaning falling out of every single fold and crevice. Everything has meaning. Every little bug exists at the same time as we do. As incoherent as it is, I even find joy in realizing we both have eyes to look at the same things together. We are under the same sky. Somehow these axioms of the human experience feel much more meaningful because he’s alive with me. If I had killed myself when I was 17 I would have never known he was out there in this very world that I am in. Living his little 17 year old life, experiencing things that would make him the man he is today. I sometimes wish we would have met as babies. I would’ve loved him when we were 10, 15, 20, just as much as I love him at 24. I think that’s what love is.

happy,"Where I live, there’s practically nothing on this road, other than apartment complexes, a school, a few house (all neighbors in the houses get along really well-) and a little corner store ran by an older Asian woman.

I am the type of girl who wears that ‘emo aesthetic’ as my mom calls it, but really I wear skater/street wear and it drives her insane. Today I am meant to go to a meeting and dress nice, so I put on a cute little dress and a cardigan matched with black heels my sister let me borrow.

My mom asked me to go get some coffee from the store, and I accepted happily so I can see the Asian lady since I actually enjoy the small talk we have when I’m checking out. When walking there however, my heel had broken outside her store, and I went in any ways with a hop, and went to get the coffee, but she had stopped me.

She took a look at what happend, and the grabbed green string and told to kneel down, and I did. She started wrapping the heel in string, and fixed it temporarily. I thanked her Atleast 20 times before I had checked out and joked about it with her for a bit.

She really made my day so much better and I can’t thank her enough, even if the trying didn’t hold all the way there and back, it still was a nice feeling and made me really happy."
happy,"I started a music project with two of my best friends a couple of years ago.  After releasing our first album I reached out to an author / reviewer to get feedback on what we'd put together.  I didn't get any feedback the first time around: this person was super busy so I didn't take any offence.  After releasing our second album I reached out again, still hopeful we'd get a listen.  It turns out this person liked our work quite a bit!  We got some very kind compliments.  I'm still smiling a day later. "
happy,"Hi everyone. Sorry that this is quite long...I had this experience in December and typed out how I felt, but I never got around to posting it. I wanted to share what happened so I’m just putting this into the aether.

What is your personal background music to make a mundane action become an epic tale to overcome your own daily anxiety of existing? I had 2 upbeat songs that lightened up my soul (like “Hey, Soul Sister” and “Get Back” by THE one the THE only Luda!), and then 1 slow song to root me back down (I had the Mr.Kitty song “After Dark”), followed by another BANGER alert “Paint the Town Red” by Doja Cat... straight banger…anyways...and then something simply great. The first four weren’t necessarily in that order, but this song was last. The soul lifter “Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros - Home”.

The mundane actions of vacuuming, cleaning, organizing, doing the dishes, emptying the cat bin, etc., all became the act of a Hero overcoming adversity. Showing that even those that only managed to shower today are at times doing their best…you even completing one of the many tasks that need to be done is inspirational and shows you are still pushing.

I must say though that I just chose my playlist of liked videos and put it on shuffle so these are songs I already liked but they made the day feel so much more personal because I connected them to being the best version of myself in that moment. I felt in sync with myself. I felt…happy.

I belted “HEY SOUL SISTA!” at the top of my lungs for my friends. I did some shit talk dancing while listening to motha’ fuckin Luda! I did some sensual hip wiggles while listening to “After Dark."" I felt so sassy during Doja...wagging my finger back and forth and bobbing my head.

I was even happier knowing that Amanda was out looking for a Christmas tree. I was listening to “Home” again when I thought that…what a beautiful song. We are moving forward in our lives and it's spectacular. We get to put ornaments and our tree topper up soon! The tree topper we use is my Beanie Baby Creepers. I got him when I was young and I started putting him up there in my early 20’s so it just kind of continued on.

Moving on though! Amazingly, I pushed myself further and completed the next mundane task…I ate food. That’s impressive if I must say so myself. Maybe not to some…but I did it. I deserve to eat. And right now I think THAT is impressive too. :)

I hope this makes sense... It felt like such a beautiful out of body moment for me and I want others to try to experience that perspective of just being themselves and that doing simple things is in of itself beautiful. If the simple things are hard at this point in time for you, please keep telling yourself that you can do hard things."
happy,"
I met this girl two months ago online and I really adore how quickly and how mutually we have gotten close to one another, despite the fact that we started off as simply friends. It happened so naturally that it really felt magical in a way, none of it being forced, its like there was an unspoken agreement that we would be together lol.
She lives abroad, a timezone away, but I still cannot help but feel sure about here and I will get to pay her a visit really soon :).
And she really is the sweetest person I have ever met. She is respectful and caring to the point that it feels impossible for her to ever step beyond my boundaries, always being reassuring to even just remove possible wrong impressions of anything that might make me feel bad. We are capable of talking about any topic without disagreement and any worry without feeling unheard or judged. She started learning my entire language just for me (🥺) and she did not miss practicing it for a single day. I wish I could return the favor but I already know English lol. Shes really the best and she puts so much effort into being so that I dont think that will ever change. I hope I can be there for here whenever she needs it and I hope that she always feels how much I value her. I would take an oath to never stop taking her on dates if I could right now, regardless of what age we may reach together. And she looks so cute too like oml I physically melt when I see her smile, I really cant mess this up guys wish me luck lol."
happy,"Workplace moment

I had a mentally bad morning after my birthday and was having a moment thinking about how certain people in my life would react if I wasn’t in this world (for context this doesn’t happen often and I am ok now).

When I came to work I turned the corner and my colleagues sang happy birthday and had a cake out for me. 

Fair to say my day went from 0-100 after that. It’s the little things that matters, even if you don’t ask if someone’s okay."
happy,"What's so special about an office snack drawer?

It sounds funny but I have dreamed of having my own snack drawer at my own desk in my own office for as long as I can remember.  While I may not have my own office, I have a nice cubicle next to a large set of windows in the corner of the building.  It's wonderful!

I spent the better part of a decade getting an undergraduate engineering degree and graduated at 33 while working to support myself and doing extracurricular projects.  There were so many times I just wanted to quit.  I moved around a lot and changed majors at one point so it took a while to get through it all but I did it.  I now work for a company that I've always wanted to work for and I have myself a snack drawer.

It's silly but this snack drawer reminds me of all the blood, sweat, and tears that went into getting my degree and I just feel so accomplished when I turn around, open it, and grab some crackers.  I've come so far since I was waiting tables with no direction in life and it's a nice reminder that all the hard work paid off.  I can't help but smile when I think about it.  Lmao, sounds so weird typing it out but it makes me so happy!"
happy,"It's been impossible for me (66F) to find anybody locally who knows enough about this to treat me, and the Mayo Clinic turned me down as a patient because I don't have the worse, more dangerous level of the disease, just the basic really shitty form of it.

I recently found out about Ketamine being used to treat chronic pain✅ trauma✅ depression✅ anxiety✅ *and this mast cell disease*✅, and five days ago I started on a daily microdose protocol. (The Ketamine works on the trauma *and* makes mast cells **calm TF down**, which helps the depression, anxiety, and pain, which will help calm down my nervous system, which will improve the mast cell symptoms, which include all of the above except the trauma.)

I didn't know what to expect because the disease makes my body think I'm allergic to virtually everything, but I haven't reacted noticeably to the drug at all. I haven't been optimistic at all about my future since my diagnosis, I'm so excited!"

happy,"Walked around the store today and smiled at a few people sharing glances. It's noticeable their expression changes before you smile at them vs. after.

happy,I’m living proof that we *DO* recover!
happy,Just comment if you want one!<3
happy,"Might not seem like a big accomplishment to a lot of people, but as someone who’s been constantly biting their nails until they bleed since like 6 years old (I’m now 16), this is a big accomplishment for me!! 

I used to bite them a lot when I was nervous, after panic attacks or after breakdowns, but for the last two weeks I haven’t had any urges to! My nails are finally long enough that I can paint them and they’re also the longest they’ve been in years! 

They might not be super long but to me they are! I’m hoping to let them grow longer and learn to do more nail art and stuff with them!"
happy,"This is gonna start off sad, but I swear it gets better. 

August 2021 I graduated college. October 2021 I was given a job offer for a career I was incredibly excited about. The job offer payed decently, and was a stepping stone for my ex-gf and I at the time to be able to start moving our relationship into a more adult-relationship; ie, moving out, buying a house, etc. 

January 2022 I started at my job and loved it. March 2022 came around, and my ex at the time had blind-sided me and left without a word. I was devastated at the time. Fast forward a few months to October, I’m at the gym and I feel a tendon in the back of my leg snap. I can’t walk. I eventually go to the doctor who just diagnoses me with a strain and tells me to go to PT. 

Long story short, I visited 2 different doctors. Both of whom could not give me a proper diagnosis which caused the PT I received to only make things worse. I was on disability from my job to take care of my leg which just wouldn’t get better, as well as therapy for depression. Eventually, I was forced to leave my job, lost my health insurance, and didn’t know if I’d ever be able to walk again. I was alone, depressed, disabled, unemployed, and had no idea about the future and what was going to happen to me. 

Eventually, I found a physio who I was able to see via Zoom (about $20/visit, so I could afford it without insurance) who was able to diagnose me and we started a PT program that I was able to do by myself. It took a long time, but she got me back on my feet, back in the gym, back to running and everything. It took me about a year to walk again. It was an extremely long process. 

Near the end of my PT, I met this woman. Smart, funny, gorgeous, kind, driven and hard working, incredibly emotionally intelligent, and… well I could go on for hours talking about this woman. We hit it off, and started dating. She’s introduced me to so many new hobbies, many of which are active activities. Some team sports, and some individual sports. I’ve started some new sports of my own, and have began to introduce her to them as well. Not only has meeting her changed my life romantically, but I’ve also gotten very close to all of her friends of which she has many. When my leg didn’t work and I lost my job, I was alone almost 24/7. I had very little help with anything from family and friends. It was the darkest time of my life. Now, I feel like it’s one of the most social and happiest times of my life. It’s been a complete 180 from where I was before. 

When my leg got better, I also applied for a federal job. I’d always wanted to work for the federal government, not just for the benefits but also for the job security. It was a very long and stressful process, but just last week I received the email with a firm job offer and I am due to begin working with them next week. 

My life has completely changed. I was in the darkest time of my life, not knowing what was going to happen to me and not knowing if I’d ever be able to walk again, hold a job, etc. I’ve now picked up a handful of new hobbies, I’m exercising and running frequently, I have a new career which I’m beyond ecstatic to begin, and a wonderful girlfriend of which I can see an actual future with. 

Words cannot begin to describe how absolutely ecstatic I am for what my future holds. "
happy,"I (20f) grew up with an emotionally abusive mother who neglected me and favoured my two older half brothers. I grew up on tv because I was a socially awkward kid and any friends I did have would want to hang with my brothers instead (we have a 6 and 7 year age gap. So when I was 8 they were teens). I saw that on a lot of my favourite shows there would be at least one picnic episode where the family would go to a park with the classic red and white blanket and eat out of a basket. I always wanted that. I would ask my mom if we could do it with her, my brothers and me ( my parents divorced when I was three and my dad had custody on weekends) but my brothers just wanted to go to the skatepark with their junkie friends. My mom chose them over me every time. So when I was 14 I stopped asking cause I knew that the one day I wanted with my family didn’t matter as much as wasting hours watching my brothers do the same old tricks. 
Anyway I haven’t seen my mother since I was 15 when my dad got full custody of me after my mom disappeared with her boyfriend of the week for a couple days. I have a carer cause I was diagnosed with autism at 13. I asked if we could do a picnic one day with just us fully prepared to be rejected but she said yes. So tomorrow we’re buying a basket and food and sitting on a blanket in the park having a picnic. 

Also mom… Fuck you. "
happy,Yum!!
happy,"Recently I suffered an accident at a grappling competition. Large fracture on my right leg and 2 smaller ones near the ankle. 

&#x200B;

You would think this is a extremely low point in my life to get such a crippling injury, well you would be quite wrong. Part of is perhaps that in the end I will make a full recovery after a few months so I would be left in the end with just the humbling experience and the attitude that people now have with me.

&#x200B;

I used to think my friends are only friends with me because I am to use of them and because we have similar hobbies where we train together. Used to think I was the after thought of my family as the middle child. My feelings were always less important than my sisters, I was always supposed to support them if something happened but it never felt like it was given back.

&#x200B;

Well not only has my family offered help to even moving in with me to help me out and interrupting their lives to do so, not only have my friends all offered to drive me to the hospital and come to my place to play board games and entertain me, and even offering to do my university work but even random strangers on the street stopping their cars and asking me where am I headed and to drive me home. Old women offering to carry my bag and even the meanest looking face tattoo dudes offering help without even being asked or remotely needed.

&#x200B;

I am a 23 year old dude, used to feel alone in the world where nobody would care if something happened to me to now feel like society actually cares. Ofcourse Ive had a negative experience too but positive experience outweighs easily the one bad experience. To the people that are like the ones that help, thank you, you have no idea how much you help. I certainly would strive to become more like the selfless people that helped me when I fully recover. And dont judge the mean looking people by appearance, maybe thats how people also viewed me before, they turn out to be the most sympathetic of them all."
happy,"It feels so euphorically good to be in love with my best friend. Have I laughed? Constantly, daily, hourly. Have I cried? Yes, tears of joy. We play video games, sometimes I watch him play, sometimes he watches me, but when we play together we always have each others backs! We go on long walks, at night, with our dog, to the beach, to different cities or exploring shops and attractions. We leave each other love notes, poetry, words of encouragement. We workout and hold each other accountable, cook meals together. We love each other’s families and feel comfortable and accepted. We have spa days together, face masks, bubble bath, scrubs, moisturizer and massages. When either of us feels sad we listen with true understanding and openness, thoughtful advice and write out plans to strengthen our resolve. We dance together, in our home, in the grocery store, with our dog or anywhere we feel like. I’ve never been so in love, at peace, accepted,  empowered and confident. I am finally happy. "
happy,"Ill try to be short and sweet, but basically I mentioned to my boyfriend, close friend of two years boyfriend for almost one year, that I'd really love a prom-posal for our senior year since I've never experienced one and it's a once in a lifetime kinda thing for us.

It was a while ago and I assumed her forgot because his schedule with school, sports, gym, etc has him running around. I wasn't even upset and chose to keep it to myself since I know his life is already hectic and didn't want to feel like I was pressuring him.

Well today we were in my room relaxing, I bought some small Lego sets to do, before we started building them he told me if I wanted to see a card trick he just learned.

He dabbles in card tricks and magic, when we first met he did a lot of magic for me, I love watching these tricks to this day. He sat me down next to him and started going on about Royal flush being the best hand in poker while doing the trick for me. I was confused but going along with it and before I knew it he said ""You know what else would be the best, you going to prom with me"" and in front of me the royal flush hand with heart cards with will you go to prom with me on the cards.

I'm heavily emotional and started bawling my eyes like a baby cause he caught me off guard and I didn't know what to say but he reminded me I had to say Yes while hugging me lol.

Regardless, I'm still tearing up over it still cause I can't believe how great of a guy he is and I adore every nerdy, geeky ounce of him.

I just wanted to share this because even though I know it's probably some silly high school romance I still feel like the luckiest person in the world.

Hope you're all having a good day or night and I wish the best for all of you who took time to read this sappy stuff :)"

happy,"My absolute angel of a mother in law and I are taking my future sister in law to a little tea house as surprise! We just told her to be ready to go at a certain time and have sworn all the boys to secrecy 😊. 

Mother in law, future sister in law and I really love tea so I really hope she likes it. Both of these ladies are absolute gems to be around and I cannot be more excited to have my future sister in law join the family ❤️. She is so sweet and considerate and sassy and I love her so much! And mother in law is an absolute doll. Anything and everything she can do to help, she'll do. She's a tiny spit fire of a woman and won't hesitate to show you what-for like she's 8 feet tall lol. 

My blood family has never treated me half as well as these ladies do and I am just so blessed to know them and have them in my life! 

So here's to a sneaky surprise!  *shush* no telling!🤫

Edit: She loved it and no one spilled the beans! We got to have a lovely little tea time with some wonderful conversation and some very delicious tea, yummy pastries and little finger sandwiches! She's actually thinking about using the location for her bridal shower 😊"
happy,"For 24 years I've worked to grow my business.  As a single parent it has been tough.  I missed many precious moments with my daughter and I've always regretted it.  My company has been my second greatest accomplishment next to my daughter.  I'm truly happy to sell it today because I'm selling it to the employees who have done so much to make it great.

I never thought this day would come and it's been an emotional rollercoaster for the last four years. I feared what retirement would mean.  I had an identity crisis coming to terms with not being the boss.  I feared boredom but the pandemic has taught me that I don't need my business.  Connection to my family and hobbies are more than enough to provide fulfillment.

I had a hard time with selling, I built this company and it's a reflection of me.  I've had plenty of offers from larger firms but I don't want to think what would have happened to my company, my employees and it's reputation if some huge conglomerate absorbed it.

It's taken years and I am not getting as much as I could if I sold to a competitor but I'm selling to people who I know will continue the company with the same standards I built it with.  I'm selling to the employees who are the ones that made it all possible. I also know I'm the only one who will be out of a job from this.

It took 4 years to let go and today I finally signed. In a few more months I'll walk away, happily. I have many years left to spend with my family, travel, enjoy my farm, and my horses. I'm truly thankful for the last 24 years and everyone who has made this moment possible.

happy,"I started a music project with two of my best friends a couple of years ago.  After releasing our first album I reached out to an author / reviewer to get feedback on what we'd put together.  I didn't get any feedback the first time around: this person was super busy so I didn't take any offence.  After releasing our second album I reached out again, still hopeful we'd get a listen.  It turns out this person liked our work quite a bit!  We got some very kind compliments.  I'm still smiling a day later. "

happy,"I had a girl I’ve been dating over for dinner and drinks last night to celebrate NYE.  Things started getting physical so I suggested going to the bedroom.  It was a hard no.

I was a little bit puzzled (we’ve had sex before).  She then informs me she has her period, appears visibly upset and apologizes.  I sort of start laughing; now she looks puzzled.

I tell her I’m chuckling at the apology; there is absolutely no reason to be sorry and I couldn’t be happier just giving her a kiss at midnight and waking up beside her tomorrow (she’s never spent the night).  I offer her a heating pad, pillows and to run out to grab some midol; whatever she needs to be comfortable, she need only let me know.

The result was a lovely young lady, stunned by the thoughtfulness and filled with appreciation.  Though I invited a ‘date’ over for dinner, we decided to become exclusive and I woke up beside my new ‘girlfriend’ the next morning.

What a great start to 2022.

Edit: inclusion of exclusivity."

For the past half of a year I have been in love with my friend. Their kind, and funny, and really sweet, not to mention cute. And I though it was not mutual, I even started telling myself that I just had to get over them, but recently another friend of ours cracked a joke about how they liked me so much, and when said friend left, leaving me alone with them, I asked about it, to which they responded they didn't know. I told them I liked them, and they got so excited, asking me over and over again if I was being for real. They told me so many cute things, like ""you make me feel like I'm so cared about"" and ""you're face- it just makes sense to me."" And we started dating and they tell me how they spend waiting in lines fantasizing about spending time with me. I genuinely didn't know I could be so happy."
happy,"Poor thing was almost dried up. I put it in my houseplant, watered it, and stuck some dead leaves in the pot. Looking a little more closely at the pictures, I could’ve nursed it a little longer (was worried the pot was too small for it), but I tried my best. I didn’t see it at the time. Nonetheless, I am so glad it’s alive and better!

happy,"I really love him. I spent forever putting his gift together and when I finally gave it to him seeing him cry made me so happy. He said he’s never been loved like this before and that he loves me more than anything. 

I’m just so so happy I get to make him feel loved cause he makes me feel so safe and loved too. I’m not so great with my words like he is but I think this really showed him how I feel :)"
happy,"This is very small, but I haven't stopped thinking about it since it happened and it makes me happy! Sorry, this might get long.

I have a weird role at my job and it was created when I was hired so there were no processes or procedures in place. It's listed as a Customer Experience Specialist role, but I am involved in every aspect of the company. One thing that's evolved, that definitely wasn't part of the job, is that coworkers confide in me knowing I have a ""loose lips sink ships"" mentality. I never reveal details or gossip, but if I'm concerned about something/someone I'll roundabout bring it up to management. 

On Friday one of my direct teammates was venting pretty hard and I went to my manager to say I was concerned this person may be experiencing burnout and I'm not sure how long they'll be with the company.  My boss said he noticed it too and if they need to leave for their mental wellbeing it's understandable and there are contingency plans in place. Then he said, all except you, there's no contingency plan if we lose you. 

Folks, I know everyone is replaceable, but this made me feel so valued and seen. I already love my job, but this was icing on the cake. 

Thank you for reading. "
happy,"I just want to say something here that maybe you'll scroll away but I wanted to share it. The thing I want to say is, I am so grateful for my boyfriend. It is Valentine's day today and although we are long distance he always makes me feel special and loved. Like today so far we have messaged but just before he started work we video called. However, he actually makes me feel special not just on days like this but every day. The way he looks at me, thinks of me and strives to make me happy throughout my life just makes me truly appreciate him. He is my support
and my joy. I have not yet recieved the gift or thing that he has planned for today but I know it will be from the heart. So I guess I'm just saying thank you to him in advance of this treatment but mostly thank you for being the man that lights up my days and for being who you are.

I hope we all get or have a partner in our life who makes us feel truly loved."
happy,"I cleaned my house after living in a pretty big mess after 2 years. For context: I live with my mom and grandpa. my mom is a hoarder and also battles manic depression so she buys a lot of things to comfort herself (not hoarders tv show level but clothes, shoes, journals, pens, books). My grandpa hoards food (not sure why) and doesn’t like to get rid of anything even if it’s expired from 2019. I also can be messy and not put things back where they go. I spent a year being mad that I had to clean the place at all because I felt like I shouldn’t have to clean up after perfectly capable people and I knew they wouldn’t make an effort to keep it clean. I guess I got over that last week because I cleaned the entire house and had about 6 garbage bags full of things to throw out that hadn’t been used in years. What really prompted the clean was my mom essentially went to stay with her sister and didn’t give me any warning or anything. I guess I felt like if the house was clean she’d come back home. This was a super long rant but anyway I’m just proud of myself that I have continued the efforts of keeping the house clean and putting things back where they go even if my grandpa and mom don’t contribute because I realized if I want the house to stay clean, it’s going to have to be me doing the clean up. "
happy,"We found her about 10 years ago as a stray in NYC and she's been with us ever since. She got out of a window once and was gone for over 24 hours but she came back, almost knocking at the front door.   
She's been my little special buddy for so many years now and knowing I can still scoop her up and give her kisses warms my heart. She's got the best personality and she's very friendly and affectionate - basically the ideal cat. Snuggles with me like a teddy bear almost every night. She's so perfect she has a heart marking on her side!  


I just needed to happyrant about my wonderful kitty. Gave her some love a moment ago and wanted to share it :)

I was going through a bad state well was about to but I got through it because of one special girl that I have been with for 3 months yes we are long distance but I got to see her for 2 days and that was the happiest I have been since my popow I feel amzing right now I really love her thank you for all the kind comments last time 😁"
happy,"Today I've been feeling stressed due to personal family issues, and I've been mentally ruminating on these issues for 1-2 hours.

I hit a 5 RM sumo deadlift today, and my mood was uplifted.

happy,"I shouldn’t be writing this since I’m about to go to bed

  
But sitting at my work desk I was feeling a little stressed about life

  
But something made it all go away

  
I closed my eyes… and starting imagining

  
Imaging my future

  
A future where I’m with my future daughter and I’m pushing her on a swing

  
She’s smiling so much and laughing and calling me daddy.

  
\-you can make it weird, but honestly it was super cute

  
I could clearly see her face so happy

  
Then another time

  
We’re at the beach and she’s older, a teenager

  
And the next scene I’m on my death bed with 5-7 kids around me

  
I’m smiling and they’re crying

  
In the present, the me who is sitting at my work desk is also smiling befause I’ve realised

  
There is no reason to be stressed

  
Thjngs can’t be bad forever, they never are, the only way to make it out of a stressful situation is to keep going and having hope.

  
Key lesson: start doing positive future visualisations when you’re lost.

  
They’ll change your life  
I hope this post is valuable to anyone feeling lost.  
Let me know what you think. What do you guys like to visualise, or think about, which makes you happy? :)"
happy,"This isn't an advertisement or anything like that, I just love it. 

I work two jobs from home, and I didn't follow the advice of ""Separate your work space from your personal space"" (it's better for your mental health) so I spend effectively 13 hours a day at my desk, with my work PC and personal PC on the same desk right next to one another. I flip my monitor between PCs, so the space I used to go to to have fun, play games, and hang out with online friends is effectively ruined by 13 hours a day being trapped in this spot. I work from 5AM-7PM and get one single day off a week. Of COURSE I'm not going to want to spend another *second* of my time at that desk than I have to. 

Obviously, this caused all my steam games to go neglected, as well as the couple little online friends I keep up with. This simply can't do. So, I bought a steam deck. 

What a wonderful little handheld computer! It can run a few itch.io games on it, they don't even have to be steam games! And there's a game from 2005 that REALLY DIDN'T like the steam deck when I first launched it (The fucking mouse cursor was controlled by the gyro function for some reason?!) but the controls are so customizable on that thing that within just 20 or 30 minutes of messing with it I got it running so comfortably that it's not just tolerable but *enjoyable* to play on the deck. I love it. It was so easy to figure out, so easy to personalize, and it's just great. 

I play games more now than I even did on my PC before I was work from home. In fact, I prefer the steam deck over my PC. I'm just not a graphics-heavy gamer and the games I play don't require fast reflexes and pinpoint accuracy, so the deck is perfect for my style of single player meandering-along story games. And I always tended to enjoy a controller more than mouse and keyboard anyway. So, just having all my games be mobile?! Man. Least regrettable big purchase I have made in a WHILE. I would buy a new one tomorrow if my current one broke. 

Again, not an advertisement. I'm just a casual gamer, with casual games, which I love to casually enjoy. And the invention of such a neat, user friendly, handheld ""gaming"" computer makes me happy. Happy-happy!!! 

Edited to add: Oh, didn't even mention. The #1 benefit is that I can be snuggled up to my family members while gaming! That's honestly the main reason I bought it. I love the people I live with and being trapped in my room all the time means I can't see them, and if I wanted to game, I'd have to take away even more time from the 3 hours a day I get to visit with them. The steam deck gives me the benefit of cuddles AND gaming. Truly living the life here, folks. "

My parents don’t love me and haven’t for a long time and I’m happy with that. Recently, my parents have shown their true colors to a lot of people, especially me. I’ve come to learn that they have only loved me conditionally, if I provide something to them. They weaponize my siblings against me, try to financially cripple me, and just try to make me feel as bad as possible. Ever since I’ve been sure of what I wanna do for a career, my mother and sister have constantly belittled it. My mother has said that my sister is her favorite and my parents have always shown that for as long as I can remember. I realize now that they don’t love me anymore and I’m happy I can move on with my life. I’ve accepted that they never will for as long as I live, and I can finally grow and surround myself with people who truly love and care about me. "
happy,He’s so cute!!! I love him cause we both love dumplings and we’re both fun dumplings cause I think that’s way cute to say plus I got lots of candy it’s so much I love it!

And that one that’s pastel blue and pink is called a Unicorn Gummy I think and I love love love LOVE unicorns🤞🏼😋!!! His shirt says “Hugs” and I got a cute bag that has him in and I got a picture with the giant giant bear inside I would’ve gotten an outside picture of the store but there were people there and I didn’t wanna stop on the middle of the walkway🙁 and the woman doing the bear fluffy stuffing was going to have me step on the button and I couldn’t (I have anxiety and got nervous😾) apparently a lot o people think they’re too old for this stuff?????? That’s crazy to me cause I never really thought like that cause I love Build-a-Bear and NEED the new Sesame Street ones !
happy,"Hi, Everyone.

I was going to wait a week, but I had to create an account and post this because I’m just too happy to keep it inside anymore.

A few days ago, my wife posted on this board. She was having a tough time sleeping, and in the middle of this rough night, the thought of something I did brought a smile to her face. She shared that moment with everyone here, and in response, the amount of goodwill and kindness that flowed from this community was overwhelming. 

She kept this post secret from me—never expecting it to make other than a few people smile. Little did she know, it would gain a ton of traction. The generosity and support that followed made it tough for her to conceal, and eventually, she showed me the thought that made her so happy this past Monday at 3 A.M..

My wife is amazing. I’m so happy, lucky, and fortunate to be in that group of people who have truly found their soulmate. My heart becomes full just thinking about her, and sometimes I just say her name randomly because it makes me happy to hear. I love her so much, and I can’t stop smiling right now.

I also want to take a moment to thank everyone in this community. What you all did truly shows the amazing types of people you are. From the messages of encouragement, to the acts of support, it’s a been such a joy. I’ll never forget any of it, and when I called my mother to tell her about what everyone here did, it seriously made her day.

Thank you all so much. You made my wife happy. You made my mom happy. For that, I will forever be grateful, and I promise to do my best to spread all the positive energy you gave us back out into the world.

This truly is the bright center of the Internet."

happy,"This is a long, very happy rant. I can't rant out of happiness this hard to anyone in my life rn

I am so happy. I can't stop talking about my glasses and it's probably getting annoying, because everyone has glasses. But I feel like a lot of people just got glasses when they first started needing them and didn't just have terrible vision that was ignored for most of their lives to the point of developing eye problems over it, and then suddenly get it corrected like in an instant, and I literally cannot shut up about it. What I thought was pretty normal vision was actually complete dogshit and now I am seeing things I couldn't even imagine a few weeks ago.

And holy shit. I pretty much immediately got hit with the heavy fist of depth perception for the first time in my life and spent like half an hour touching the sink and putting my hands in the corners of the room because everything was suddenly EXTREMELY 3D. I feel like I am in an actual video game. I used to joke that video games are higher definition than my actual vision but not right now.

Everything is so BRIGHT. Everything is so DETAILED. Grass doesn't all blend together anymore, everything on my shelf is a distinct individual object, I can see a face a few feet away, hell I can read something across the street. It's nuts. Colours are so sharp and saturated now, life isnt a foggy haze around me, everything is in such intense focus and detail I keep just staring at little things and tearing up. 

AND I CAN ACTUALLY READ OH MY GOD. I've been afraid to Crack open a novel because I'm afraid it's going to be too good to be true, but as far as scrolling on my phone, sentences and words are so crisp and distinct. I don't have to hold it at right up to my actual nose, close one eye and squint just to have my eye bounce all over the page and give me a headache after about one sentence. 

And better, I haven't had double vision in days. I used to get it every day like clockwork around 2pm until the end of the day. Since putting on my glasses, I guess my brain just. Isn't trying to mash together two extremely different visual fields anymore and giving up or something (I'm not a doctor, that makes sense to me though)

I'm just losing my mind. I never want to take them off. I have to force myself to take them off at bedtime. I want to order 500 pairs and put them on a special shelf like a shrine lol. I have never been more greatful for anything before.

It's insane how bad I let this get under the guise of ""it's always been like this, it was like this when I grew up, can't imagine it gets that much better than this now."" It's like the Crack in your windshield that you eventually stop noticing until your windshield explodes."
happy,Mum has been helping me orchestrate so she knows I'm coming back- I haven't seen my family since Christmas and I've especially missed my little sister so I decided instead of staying at uni for reading week I'm gonna go home and surprise her!
happy,"I was asked by one of my friends if I wanted to go to her church and I said yes because I don’t usually get to hang out with her outside of school. When I got there it was loud but the music was good, after a while we then got food that was absolutely delicious 😋, It was Spaghetti, garlic bread, and fried chicken, plus a salad and a cup of apple juice :D, I ate and had fun talking to my friend and when we left we got Starbucks, me and my friend listened to music for the rest of the car ride to my home. I’m now home and I just really wanted to share what happened today, Sadly this was the first year I didn’t celebrate Easter with a Easter egg hunt but I still had just as much of a good time as the other past years :)

Be Happy guys 😁🙌❤️"
happy,Cheers!
happy,"So, basically I had 1€ in my bank account, a d my best friend transfered the remaining 5 to me, because we wanted to play a game together that was on sale. I'm so grateful and happy. I'm definitely going to pay him back though, because I would feel bad if I didn't. Besides, it's the right thing to do. He just deserves the world. Of course, I told him that he didn't have to since it's just a game i could get dor the regular price next month, but he insisted so much, because he knew how much I liked the game from watching him play it during shareplay.

As someone has asked this before in this thread : I'm not comfortable sharing private information with strangers such as sharing my PayPal info."
happy,"This morning I was going to work and it was dark but I saw my bf pass me on the highway on our way to work, I instantly got butterflies. Then when I got to the Dunkin drive thru who do I see in front of me….. it’s him. Lol I didn’t think he would notice but then when I got to the window to pay for my coffee the cashier said “here you go. The gentleman in front of you already paid” it’s the little things. y’all I’m so in love 🥰 "
happy,"An undergraduate student I have mentored for the past two-ish years applied to graduate school for the Fall 2024 admissions cycle. I helped them a lot with their applications and talked through deciding where to apply, etc. I've been getting periodic texts from them over the last few weeks as they've received their admissions (and one rejection so far) and it's been such an honor to share in their excitement. They even said I'm one of the first people they want to tell and that just put me over the moon.

Today they got an acceptance into a BIG school and one that was sort of a ""shoot for the stars"" application and I just shrieked and hollered when I got their message. Tears are streaming down my cheeks, but they are happy happy tears. What a privilege to be able to experience this joy with them. Truly an honor. I'm so lucky."
happy,"I was being intimate with a white guy and I’m an awkward person so I said I had “hair extensions” and he didn’t mind. He didn’t care at all. He treated me like a normal person… he even touched my head gently a couple of times which made my hairstyle a bit messy but nothing bad happened.

I’m young and the reason I wear wigs is I don’t want to hear damage my real hair :3"
happy,"Howdy y'all,

A little background: so I'm autistic with a few special interests, e.g. history, aviation, and hot dogs (that one's not important, but still hot dogs are awesome, fight me lol)

Today is not my birthday, but as I'm in the middle of a grueling job search, my friends thought it important to take me out early to both cheer me up and ensure I had a day off.

That is what I assumed, at least!

Turns out these absolute a-holes tricked me and treated me to a lovely day around the city enjoying my favorite things. We went and had a fabulous breakfast before jumping ship to an aviation museum, then enjoying a day by the beach in a more touristy spot of my city before finally going to an art museum styled after a Roman Villa (the Getty Villa in Los Angeles, I highly recommend if you're ever out this way)

Now, I had a blast, but as it turns out, they had one more surprise for me.

A plane ticket to Rome with complete reservations for accommodations!

I'm having a panic attack. I don't know how to respond. I don't know how to pay them back. I'm so incredibly lucky! What could I have possibly done to deserve any of this?!"
happy,"
I met this girl two months ago online and I really adore how quickly and how mutually we have gotten close to one another, despite the fact that we started off as simply friends. It happened so naturally that it really felt magical in a way, none of it being forced, its like there was an unspoken agreement that we would be together lol.
She lives abroad, a timezone away, but I still cannot help but feel sure about here and I will get to pay her a visit really soon :).
And she really is the sweetest person I have ever met. She is respectful and caring to the point that it feels impossible for her to ever step beyond my boundaries, always being reassuring to even just remove possible wrong impressions of anything that might make me feel bad. We are capable of talking about any topic without disagreement and any worry without feeling unheard or judged. She started learning my entire language just for me (🥺) and she did not miss practicing it for a single day. I wish I could return the favor but I already know English lol. Shes really the best and she puts so much effort into being so that I dont think that will ever change. I hope I can be there for here whenever she needs it and I hope that she always feels how much I value her. I would take an oath to never stop taking her on dates if I could right now, regardless of what age we may reach together. And she looks so cute too like oml I physically melt when I see her smile, I really cant mess this up guys wish me luck lol."
happy,"It feels so euphorically good to be in love with my best friend. Have I laughed? Constantly, daily, hourly. Have I cried? Yes, tears of joy. We play video games, sometimes I watch him play, sometimes he watches me, but when we play together we always have each others backs! We go on long walks, at night, with our dog, to the beach, to different cities or exploring shops and attractions. We leave each other love notes, poetry, words of encouragement. We workout and hold each other accountable, cook meals together. We love each other’s families and feel comfortable and accepted. We have spa days together, face masks, bubble bath, scrubs, moisturizer and massages. When either of us feels sad we listen with true understanding and openness, thoughtful advice and write out plans to strengthen our resolve. We dance together, in our home, in the grocery store, with our dog or anywhere we feel like. I’ve never been so in love, at peace, accepted,  empowered and confident. I am finally happy. "

happy,"I spent eight years in an incredibly abusive relationship. Emotionally, mentally, and physically. I was devalued every step of the way and never realized that there were people taking advantage of me. But about two years ago I found people who actually love and care about me, realized my family loves me and that I was being lied to that they didn't. The people who used me did and still will claim I'm a failure, but they wouldn't be where they are without me. But more importantly, I've now surrounded myself with smart, empathetic, kind, successful people and my heart is full of happiness and love now because of it. I have a wonderful relationship, a successful career, and so much to look forward to. I'm so lucky to have what I have now. I'm so happy that I left and can now be a better person for it. I have so much hope for the future that I could never have had before, and I look forward to all of the happiness and success waiting for me now that I've moved on to better things."
happy,My husband is on the path to the airlines which means we get to spend lots of Sunday afternoons flying around to get hours. Sedona is always spectacular 
happy,"Most of my life I've had little to no self esteem. I've always thought little of myself. Little to the point I settled for people, things and situations that I didn't deserve. For the last year I've been working on me. I started exercising and I've lost weight, I've grown in my faith, I've even started expanding my mind trying to learn new things, for example I've been studying German for a year for fun. Today I realized I'm not a bad guy and I have a lot of good to offer others and my self image has drastically improved. For the forst time I'm getting some self esteem and I'm starting to like myself which I never have. I just felt like sharing this."
happy,I can’t even describe this. I feel so light and nice and light and my head is spinning 
happy,"I'm solo traveling at the moment and I've had the realisation that I'm a completely different person than I was when I was younger (I'm 32 now). I remember back then I was so insecure and I dealt with crippling anxiety. I was so self aware and ashamed of myself that I had to mentally prepare myself to do grocery shopping because I was so afraid that people would judge me. I've never been conventionally attractive, but back then I was convinced I I was absolutely hideous and I didn't deserve good things. I feel so sorry for my younger self. Now I don't give a crap about what people think of me, I've accepted myself for who I am and find beauty in small things. Sometimes I still struggle with my appearance, but not in the self destructive way as I did ten years ago.I try to always be kind to myself and treat myself how I treat good friends. At the moment I'm doing whatever I want whenever I want, all the choices I make, I make for me. It is so freeing. I feel so much love for myself, ny life, my friends and family, my work.
God I love solo traveling."
happy,"First there's A, she's been my number one bestie since we were 7! Me and her get together to watch bullshit reality TV and talk major shit about the men. She loves videogames and she 100% completed breath of the wild and working her way through the new one. She loves her younger brother and takes him on as many vacations as she can. She puts together the most perfect for you, beautiful thoughtful gifts which she presents for you artfully. She has a talent at art and also interior design and her place is stylishly decorated and immaculately clean. Her passion lies in the Library though and she's almost finished with her masters in library science while working full time as a receptionist but soon she'll be a librarian. She's also super fucking funny. When we get together it's allllways laughing.

Then there's B, she's only like a genius scientist and professor with a perfect SAT score who just landed a job at NASA working from home. ALSO she runs marathons even though she got long COVID and has heart problems now. Her goal is still to run in every state and she's still working her way through it. She also skiis, roller skates, rock climbs, and has completed iron man triathlons. On top of that she can also draw and recently she made her own stickers of famous rock formations (shes a geologist). She's the most emotionally intelligent human I know and crafts everything she says with the most delicate tactful gentle thoughtfulness without sugarcoating anything and tells you things to challenge your ideas and potentially harmful or toxic thought processes. She is also a good baker and sends me cookies in the mail a lot!

Then there's C, he's probably the most interesting dude I know although it took him two years of talking to me every day to actually open up about the history of his life. He's been to jail a few times for various things and he told me all about the people there and most of them were ok guys who just ran amock and got themselves in trouble (except for theives who were all around no good people) he's been a chef in fancy restaurants but he is keen on languages and very knowledgeable about them particularly those from the middle east. He originally wanted to be an academic until life took a turn. When he was younger he did martial arts, tended to carnivorous plants, was part of the orchid society, and went out into the wilderness to hunt rocks a lot. He got into bad accidents and was badly injured so now he can't really do the stuff he used to love. It makes me sad. But he's super funny in the most imaginative quirky way. And no one has ever made me laugh in quite the same way.

Then there's well, the other C. He's a young thing. He's a bright person with a promising future. He's in medical school studying to be a surgeon and he's recently gotten his masters degree in the top of his class. He loves videogames and he's quiet, reserved, values manners but he's not afraid of dancing. He loves a good party and night out. When I went to the uk and visited him, he showed me some of the castles in Wales of which he is very proud. He has a strong sense of patriotism about being Welsh. He is the most different from me of all of my friends from two totally different upbringings and worlds but somehow we never run out of things to talk about. When I get in my dramatic moods, He has a way of saying just the perfect matter of fact thing to drop me down to earth and I laugh as I fall. He is a complete nerd to the core but he has a little bit of a charming cockiness and confidence that makes me love the hell out of him.

I have a bunch more friends but if I told you about them all then this would be insanely long! So I just talk about the closest ones. "
happy,"Compliments from strangers hit different 😍 she said I was gorgeous and when she saw me she said whoa, I've been feeling in the dumps and have a breakout and I just needed that!!  Thank you!!"
happy,"I have two beautiful kids that I love dearly and they are both my bonus children. My husband made an appointment for tomorrow to start the ball rolling on reversing his vasectomy. 

When we met he told me he didn’t really believe in marriage and he already had his children. I said I was fine with that, and I was. But time has passed and we’ve moved together and grown together. He tells me I’m the best mother he’s ever seen, that I deserve my own and that he desperately wants it too. Our kids ask us constantly when we’re going to have a baby. Hopefully we can answer that soon. 

Send us some baby dust on this Valentine’s Day. 🫶🏼"
happy,"i (f19) am in a long distance relationship with my gf (f22). things are really tight so i thought that maybe i wouldn’t be able to afford to get my gf much for valentine’s day. she calls me goose a lot and i ended up finding a stuffed goose that’s about my height! i also found some of her favorite candies and some face masks that she enjoys for a relatively affordable price.  i’m just super happy i got to get her some meaningful things, even if it’s not much. I included a picture of the goose (i got the largest one) :))"
happy,12 years ago we met in a psych ward after we had both tried to rage quit the planet. We've been together ever since!
happy,"It's a new day. I woke up with air in my lungs, a body that can move. The people I love inhabiting this same home with me. They are what makes it home for me. A warm, safe place that I'm heading to for work. 

This is life and even in the simple moments it is breathtakingly beautiful."
happy,"Sorry for my bad english. I am a 23 year old guy, i work as a security guard in south america and live far from my family. I have an older sister (28 and works as a party organiser) and a younger brother (9 almost 10) who i love more than myself, i chat from time to time with my older sister since we both know the other is probably busy, on the other hand i play videogames with my brother almost every day and since he is young i play better than him (im not the best but i have been playing for many years now)we have tons of fun and he gets very sad when i have to leave, he joined my discord server along with my friends who are around my same age and he try to keep up with us as much as he can (i gifted him ""ForHonor"" and he is very good at it). Yesterday my older sister asked me about my pfp on discord (an ia image a friend made for me combining my gamertag ""turtle"" and a spacemarine from 40k) so i told her and she asked for the original picture, so i sent it to her along with some pther similar ones. When i sked what they were for she told me that our brother wanted a birthday party... and the theme was me... i expected a spiderman party or something like that. I cant belive how much that little guy loves me and looks up to me. He makes me the happyest brother."
happy,"Tomorrow is my 18th birthday. I don't have friends, I don't have a high school diploma, I'm fighting/no contact with almost my entire family, and I work a low paying job. But I'm alive, I have a roof, usually have food. There are a lot of people that can't say the same. I've been severely depressed since I was young, a lot of people told me to ""die"", or that ""I definitely wouldn't make it to adulthood"" (guess what, bitches). Eighteen years old is like a baby that can vote, I have a lot to figure out. I'm just beginning life. 

I'll treat myself tomorrow, I'll order in a LOT of food, and binge watch my favorite movie saga. I'm so proud of myself!!! 😎"
happy,"2 years ago, when I told my family and friends I wanted to release all original music as a fully independent artist, and try to turn it into a full time living, almost everyone I knew didn’t believe I’d get very far… I know realistically the vast majority of people that try don’t get far, so I could understand where they were coming from (the music industry is insanely hard to make a living in). But I would never know if I didn’t try…So I did. And I worked so hard, and so many times I asked myself why I was doing this…So many times I wanted to give up. But looking at this milestone, I feel very happy and proud that I didn’t give up. I’m also earning a decent part time income from my music too! The next goal is full time! Just thought I’d share this, and to not give up on your dreams if you truly love doing them! :)
"
happy,"Tomorrow marks one whole month of not purging or throwing up, and recovering from my second bout with bulimia!!"
happy,"I can't believe I know how to play chess now. I always shunned it because I thought it required way too much thinking for it to be any kind of fun game, but now that I know how the pieces move, I feel like I can do a lot more intellectual things. Really, I learned how to play for two reasons: I quit two of my greatest addictions and really needed something new to occupy my mind. The other reason is because someone once asked me if I knew how to play chess, and it came off as them questioning my intelligence, and I didn't like that at all. So, now I finally know how to play and have so much more I can learn, which is great because I have so much time on my hands.

I'm having a blast! I can't believe I never took the time to learn this very great game. I'm so happy!"
happy,"I'm a few states away from home for a conference this week, and during some downtime I looked up things to do nearby. Turns out the art museum a short walk away had my FAVORITE sculpture on display, I didn't even know it had been put into a collection! 

L' Amante by Beth Cavener is every bit as beautiful in real life as I could have imagined and I am SO excited to have been able to marvel at it with my own two eyes!"
happy,"
As Violet's third birthday draws near, just two days away, I find myself overwhelmed with a sea of emotions. It's astonishing to think that my little girl is turning three, and at twenty, I've already spent these transformative years as her father. Time has sped by, filled with both challenges and incredible rewards.

Discovering I would become a father at seventeen was a shock. A mix of fear, uncertainty, excitement, and a heavy sense of responsibility hit me all at once. The day Violet arrived, holding her tiny, delicate body in my arms, I was struck with awe. Her blue eyes looked up at me, her dark brown hair perfectly framing her face. At that moment, I vowed to myself and to her that I would do everything possible to give her a joyful, safe, and fulfilling childhood.

Being thrust into fatherhood at such a young age forced me to mature quickly. Balancing school, work, and parenting felt like a high-wire act. Sleepless nights, early mornings, and countless moments of self-doubt were my new normal. But each time I saw Violet's smile or heard her giggle, I remembered why I was doing this. She was my drive, my reason to keep moving forward.

Violet is more than my daughter; she is my greatest inspiration and teacher. Even as a toddler, her intelligence and creativity continually amaze me. Her boundless imagination and inquisitive mind remind me of the wonder and beauty in the world. I strive to nurture her curiosity and ensure she always retains a sense of wonder. Her strength and resilience reflect my own, and together, we tackle life's challenges.

My primary goal has always been to create a stable and nurturing environment for Violet. I work full-time, saving diligently so I can provide a place where she has her own room—a space for her personality to blossom and her dreams to grow. This journey to success is demanding, but each step is fueled by my desire to give Violet the best start in life. I want her to believe she can achieve anything, and I am committed to being the role model she needs.

Navigating shared custody with Violet's mother has been a significant learning curve. Though we were never together, we both prioritize giving Violet a loving and supportive environment. Effective co-parenting requires clear communication, compromise, and a shared understanding of our roles in Violet's life. Despite the difficulties, we've managed to establish a balanced routine for her, ensuring she feels loved and supported by both parents.

With her third birthday approaching, my heart swells with gratitude and pride. Violet has changed my life in ways I never imagined, and I cherish every moment we share. I also feel the rapid passage of time acutely. It seems like just yesterday I was holding her for the first time, and now she is a bright, imaginative, and intelligent little girl who amazes me daily.

Reflecting on these past three years, I see how much I have grown alongside Violet. Fatherhood has taught me resilience, patience, and the true essence of unconditional love. It has also deepened my determination to work hard and secure her future. As I continue on this path, I am constantly reminded of love's power and the resilience of the human spirit.

Sitting here, flooded with nostalgia, pride, and some anxiety about the future, I recognize that every moment with Violet is a precious gift. She has brought immense joy and purpose into my life. I am committed to being the best father I can be, ensuring she always feels loved, supported, and encouraged to chase her dreams. Together, we will continue navigating this journey, building a future filled with love, hope, and endless possibilities."
happy,"Compliments from strangers hit different 😍 she said I was gorgeous and when she saw me she said whoa, I've been feeling in the dumps and have a breakout and I just needed that!!  Thank you!!"
happy,"I've resisted unhealthy snacks today!

I've resisted, even though I've been tempted to have some because I'm quite hungry. I'm so happy, because I've gained almost 20kg due to my pregnancy and I desperately want to lose it so that I can feel good about myself again. 

Also, I plan on exercising today, even though it's hard to make time for myself. I've been so incredibly depressed after giving birth and, despite my hunger now, I'm not going to give in to having a snack because then I'm never going to make progress. 

I'm tired of disappointing myself and avoiding looking in the mirror. Today, skipping snacks and exercising is a small step in the right direction. I'm taking things one day at a time, one small step at a time. Please wish me luck! :)"
happy,You can do it too!!!
happy,"
So I’ve officially made it a month away from drinking and about 2 months away from morphine. And considering all the shit I’ve been through recently and the fact I was drinking a handle of vodka every school week and every weekend for over a year I am incredibly proud of myself for not relapsing. I went from chugging my last drink in last then 30 seconds to only smoking an 8th in like a week. I’m also kinda happy cuz I just turned 16 and now I don’t have to worry about me being stupid and trying to drink and drive. Honestly all of this only happened because my girl didn’t like me when I was  drunk. and considering I’m not the only one in my family who has had a drinking problem and I’ve seen how alcohol ruined my grandparents marriage and eventually led to my grandfathers death at 45 I honestly feel kinda strong for once."
happy,"This isn't an advertisement or anything like that, I just love it. 

I work two jobs from home, and I didn't follow the advice of ""Separate your work space from your personal space"" (it's better for your mental health) so I spend effectively 13 hours a day at my desk, with my work PC and personal PC on the same desk right next to one another. I flip my monitor between PCs, so the space I used to go to to have fun, play games, and hang out with online friends is effectively ruined by 13 hours a day being trapped in this spot. I work from 5AM-7PM and get one single day off a week. Of COURSE I'm not going to want to spend another *second* of my time at that desk than I have to. 

Obviously, this caused all my steam games to go neglected, as well as the couple little online friends I keep up with. This simply can't do. So, I bought a steam deck. 

What a wonderful little handheld computer! It can run a few itch.io games on it, they don't even have to be steam games! And there's a game from 2005 that REALLY DIDN'T like the steam deck when I first launched it (The fucking mouse cursor was controlled by the gyro function for some reason?!) but the controls are so customizable on that thing that within just 20 or 30 minutes of messing with it I got it running so comfortably that it's not just tolerable but *enjoyable* to play on the deck. I love it. It was so easy to figure out, so easy to personalize, and it's just great. 

I play games more now than I even did on my PC before I was work from home. In fact, I prefer the steam deck over my PC. I'm just not a graphics-heavy gamer and the games I play don't require fast reflexes and pinpoint accuracy, so the deck is perfect for my style of single player meandering-along story games. And I always tended to enjoy a controller more than mouse and keyboard anyway. So, just having all my games be mobile?! Man. Least regrettable big purchase I have made in a WHILE. I would buy a new one tomorrow if my current one broke. 

Again, not an advertisement. I'm just a casual gamer, with casual games, which I love to casually enjoy. And the invention of such a neat, user friendly, handheld ""gaming"" computer makes me happy. Happy-happy!!! 

Edited to add: Oh, didn't even mention. The #1 benefit is that I can be snuggled up to my family members while gaming! That's honestly the main reason I bought it. I love the people I live with and being trapped in my room all the time means I can't see them, and if I wanted to game, I'd have to take away even more time from the 3 hours a day I get to visit with them. The steam deck gives me the benefit of cuddles AND gaming. Truly living the life here, folks. "
happy,It was a cheap one but decided to try real Champaign to celebrate 
happy,"When I'll start earning my own income, I'll definitely have my personal libary within my room! I really want to discover, read and acquire new books!

happy,"I'm 28 years old. I graduated high school early and expectations were high for me even though I lived in a toxic sometimes abusive household. I worked in a restaurant to claw myself out of the gutter, and ended up with pretty severe addiction problems. Over 2 years ago I decided I wanted to break the cycle of mental illness and addiction in my family. I wanted to work on my mental health, but I knew that meant recovery. I went to treatment, found a form of therapy that worked for me and after 2 years of individual with a year of group therapy in there I have evolved! Not only did I get a day job that I love and feel valued at, but I also began school in January! My first term just ended, and I got A's in my two classes! And I got 100% in my favorite class of all time!! A good friend of mine went to some nice schools in the area but he's been beyond supportive throughout my journey so I texted him about school and that was his response. I'm so blessed. Good friends, just got a raise and more hours at my day job, we have partial custody over my step son, and I'm doing great mentally and emotionally on top of it all! IF I CAN DO IT YOU CAN DO IT TOO! LOVE YOU ALL TGIF I GET TO SAY THAT NOW AFTER QUITTING THE RESTAURANT LIFE IT KEEPS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER YALL XOXOXOXOXOX"
happy,"My mum has always been big into sewing and is much better at it than I am, I lost my quilt when I was 19 and we had a flood and it broke my heart because I was planning on passing it onto my daughter. But out of the blue this arrived. My daughter loves it and it's an absolutely gorgeous quilt. It looks like it took an insane amount of time (from all the different patches, edging and lining I'd estimate about 30 hours) and it's got a whole story that my mum wrote out by hand. The nostalgia, happiness at seeing my daughters joy and appreciation for the effort my mum went to for her granddaughter has made me the most proud and happy son/father "
happy,"Man oh MAN!!! First off, im absolutely fucking ZOOTED off a 5mg candy. 2nd today was so freakin FUN! Long story short, i have been sober but a 5 year streak of Alcoholism. I slowed down to only on special occasions starting on my birthday (July 31) of last year, only drank christmas, thanksgiving, and once a week before christmas because i had found out my dad needed heart bypass surgery, last try out drink was a shot in February of this year and i have not drank SHIT since. Anyways, today i took my brother to the dispensary. It was his first time and i said it was on me. I got home and i felt so good i just wanted to share. 

Ive always wanted to cross of my bucket list have a first experience with one of my siblings. I know thats a odd experience but the way my brother was excited to go with me was so filling. It was just the fact that we got to enjoy a shared interest. although i do not condone drug use if it is illegal in your state, like i said, sharing a similar interest together was great. He even said “Next time i get paid, it’s on me.” 

Today was great. I feel so whole again. My heart feels so light for the first time in years and im just so excited to enjoy more things in life after feeling so low for such a long time.

happy,Family dog didn't want to come inside from the snow. So I took a break from work and spent some quality time appreciating the outdoors. I'm glad I trusted his instinct.
happy,"A few years ago when I was in Year 13 (last year of high school in the UK) my form tutor didn't show up one day and it turned out she was having a family bereavement. She was very well liked and her family was all the way in New Zealand so it felt like we could hardly just do nothing.

I stepped up to the plate and bought a card, and somehow got it around the whole form class, plus a few people in the media class she took in our year as I recall, over the course of a few days without her knowing. The message I wrote in the card was ""don't be sad it's over, be glad it happened"", which was what I lived by when my Grandma died a couple of years later in 2022. 

The day comes to give it to her, and it turns out a few girls in the class have also bought her a box of chocolates, even better right? They hand her the chocolates, and I make my friend hand her the card because of my social anxiety. We thought she'd appreciate it, but we got more than we bargained for. She's clearly holding back tears and starts talking about how loved she felt and how lucky she was to be our form tutor.

This was during the few months of COVID where schools were open in the UK, so things were obviously really grim at the time. She was a really sweet, positive, glass half full person to be around and so form class with her was really the only thing keeping a lot of us going. Not only did the gifts have a good impact on her, but it felt like we'd paid her back a little as well."
happy,"Hi, just posting here because I like the vibe and everyone sub talking about jobs is depressing and bleh. I have a question, I was recently hired into the bank 6 months ago with no prior experience and I am loving it. I recently got a promotion and I'm starting to stress because I don't know where I want this to take me. I'm very excited, as I know I will do very well but I want to try to refine what I want to do so I have more of a direction but have no idea how to find out what I wanna do. Also, how do I relax and enjoy my life, instead of always thinking about work and where I could do better, Thanks!!"
happy,I've been using a Couch to 5k app that uses progressive overload to help you run a 5k. My mental health has been tanking so working out for MYSELF hits different. Potential weightloss a huge benefit. Anyways. Super proud of myself after being a potato for the last few years! 🥰😀
happy,"I have been doing this job for couple of months and I have made a very strong bond with some of the kids.

happy,This is my cat Hopper. He’s a pretty rad and chill cat and really just likes to hang out with his people. The lil dude doesn’t know it but he makes me very happy and life would be boring without him. 
happy,One of my closest friends went to NYC in an au pair exchange and I painted one of my favorite photos of us  with watercolor and then I gave it to her at the airport before she got on the plane! 💗 She loved btw and it's now on her bedside table in her bedroom at her host family house. 
happy,"I didn’t want cats. But these two little guys are here now and I’m so glad they are. 

My older one was a bony 6-month-old stray last winter that begged my mom for help, he demanded attention. He wanted love so much that the thought of sending him to a shelter where he’d be alone in a cage broke my heart, so I took him in. My younger one was a 1-2-month-old kitten who went on an adventure. She climbed into my roommate’s fiancée’s car while she was delivering food in a trailer park and wouldn’t leave. She took the kitten home, but her dog didn’t get along with it. Based on how she described the kitten, I again couldn’t send it to the shelter, so I took her in. 

Both live with me in my college apartment. It took some adjusting for them, but it was worth it. They’re best friends now, I love seeing them together. They play fight constantly, I can tell my older one is holding back and my younger one is learning how to catch him off guard. They love to eat at the same time as well. The older one always sleeps right by me and the younger tends to sleep on the ground or in the cat tree. When I wake up in the morning, they’ll both wake up too, and and younger one will always hop up on my bed purring and immediately go touch noses with my older one. 

We had to travel back home for Christmas, my older one has bad separation anxiety and he would’ve been alone for a couple days so I took both of them. They were stressed in their new environment. So when we went to bed, they cuddled with each other, paws on one another for comfort and support. 

I’m so glad I’ve been able to provide them a good home. Watching them grow up has been an honor. From putting their first collars on them to seeing my kitten see snow for the first time, there’s so much to smile about. They’ve got so much time to spend with each other, I’m looking forward to it. I’m glad I’ve not only been able to give them a home, but that I’ve given them siblings and best friends, another cat that they can trust and play with."
happy,"Recovery has been really rough, but I'm so proud of myself for driving and going out today, even just for a few minutes!"
happy,"Not only was I drinking out of despair for my unfortunate life, but I was making my life more unfortunate with drinking. I was depressed. Couldn’t hold a job. Was in debt. Unhealthy life habits and terribly unhealthy, both physically and mentally. Had toxic friendships and relationships. Deep down I hated myself and thought it was the life I deserved, and I couldn’t ever live a happy life. 9 months ago I decided to change that. My whole life has turned around! I’ve lost weight, am finally experiencing true happiness, have a wonderful partner and meaningful relationships, am constantly working on making my self and life better, and may even be able to retire before I hit 30.  Oh, and I am nearly 3 months sober of weed as well!!!!

Today is such a good day. "
happy," I got both a new laptop, and a PS5! I came into some money recently so I decided to treat myself. I needed a new laptop for school I just started at a university, and a PS5 so I can play the new Spiderman game! I have wanted a PS5 for nearly 3 years now, and it is finally mine. I also bought my textbooks for school as well. I still have a lot of money, but I will not go overboard. I will spend only what I need. I can buy lunch this week at school, and fix my bike but thats it. I need to open a savings account online and I will just put a bunch of it in there. "
happy,"Thrilled to be in our new house!  We've been in an apartment for the last 5 years.  Today, I'm opening moving boxes, cleaning...and turning up the music as LOUD as I want!  I've been waiting for this for so long!!

happy,You can do it too!!!
happy,Yum!!
happy,"(Just to preface this, it happened yesterday, and I wrote it yesterday, so it’s in present tense, but happened yesterday)

So I have a lot of very noticeable self harm scars on my legs. Especially my right thigh. They’re basically all over, and pretty close to my knees. If I wear shorts, they’re extremely visible. Today, it was 85 degrees, and I also am in track and field.

I was super super nervous about wearing shorts to school today, because it’d really be the first time anyone would have seen my scars, and I was just freaking out. The day had gone pretty good, 2 girls asked me what happened to my leg, I just said “it’s not important” and they left it at that.

Then, at the end of track practice, a guy a couple grades older than me comes up to me, and says “hey, amazing-flute-piano, are those scars?” As he gestures towards his own leg. Internally, I’m dying. Like I’m soooo nervous for what he’s about to say.

I just say “yea, they are”. Then he says “I think you’re so incredibly brave for wearing shorts. That takes a lot of courage.” And I just thanked him.

I also smiled. I did more than smile. I cried. I started crying from the sheer gratefulness and gratitude I felt. I started crying because I never expected those words to come out of anyone’s mouth, let alone another high schoolers. I started crying because that meant so much to me. It made me feel so happy. It truly did. It made me feel like I wasn’t alone, and that not everyone will judge me. It made me feel proud, and not ashamed.

Tomorrow, I have a class with him, and I’m going to make sure that I thank him again, because he deserves it. 🤍"
happy,"Ever since I was a teenager I wanted a pair but they were always too expensive for me. My BF took the plunge and for my birthday (which is in a month, but he wanted me to get the most out of these boots during January lol) him and my best friends split the costs on the gift. They are in the box next to my bed as I'm typing this. I feel like a little child that got a very precious toy and can't sleep without hugging it. I almost ran up the wall when I first tried them on.

I wanted to share this here. I feel bougie and expensive with these Demonia boots lol"

happy,"I work by myself in animal rescue in a place where abandoned animals is pretty common. After my money goes into them and my own groceries, I often have next to nothing to spend on myself. For the last year and a half, I was sleeping on an old donated sofa bed in the main room. But my birthday was last month, and some friends chipped in to buy me the mattress, bed frame, and even new pillows and bedsheets! I did end up building it myself, which took the whole month because I had to find time between running around doing animal stuff, so it feels like my accomplishment too. I just feel so proud of myself and so happy and lucky to have great friends.
"
happy,"my online friend from a different country visited for her birthday and invited me to disneyland! i have never gone before in my life! i was really taken aback by her offer too. she bought my ticket, for her bday celebration trip? 😭😭😭

she made it possible that me and my partner could actually afford to go and meet her there. 🥺🥺🥺

i brought her a gift related to her one of her special interest, it was something she said she wanted too, so it was perfect and she was so happy. she also gifted me a plush, which is my special interest! i will cherish this plush forever. 

my partner and i spent the whole day with her and it was amazing. i have no irl friends, only online as it is what i prefer. i find like-minded individuals with the same interests! we are also both diagnosed with ASD, and we really clicked as friends in real life as we do online! ☺️ it was just the same! 

she is going back to her home country tomorrow and that’s bittersweet, but the memories we made today were priceless!

this is the first online friend i’ve ever met in person before too. she is such a sweet friend! my partner really enjoyed hanging out with her too! 

had to gush about my day, as it’s the best i’ve had in a very long time. maybe ever."
happy,"
Started a new job in February and became fast friends with Amanda. Her friendship means the world to me. Even though she is 18 years younger than me. We just love being friends. Yesterday we got our nails done and had dinner and drinks. 
I laughed so much my cheeks hurt. ☺️😊
We even got drinks that look like us 😂🤣"
happy,"She told me, ""I know what it's like to not be able to leave home, so now you can."""
happy,"It took a lot of saving, moving things around financially, and sacrificing. I’m looking to improve my finances (and my life) in the future, but it’s good to have hope for once. Really was worried I’d miss the deadline. 

Sorry, I known I’ve been a problem , and I have no one who really cares enough in my life to share this with. Thank you guys for allowing me."
happy,"I moved into a small flat when I had my first child, we've lived here for a long time and grown our family and made do with what we had. The area we are in isn't the nicest but we always made the best of it. I started looking for something bigger for us 5 years ago. 
2 years ago we were broken into, (nothing taken, it was a drug addict looking for someone, but refused to believe they didn't live in our house), that same year a new neighbor moved in who vandalised cars on the street, picked fights with passers by, started giving sweets to children in their gardens when the parents weren't looking and he eventually broke into a girl nearbys home. (He didn't harm her just scared her and left)
Last week, I got a call that there is a house available via council housing and I can finally have something more affordable, safer and bigger for my children. When I showed my daughter the keys the first thing she asked was 'is it somewhere safe?' And I can finally say yes. I feel more at peace than I have done in years."
happy,"A few days ago my co worker complimented me on my hair. She said that it's in perfect condition and that she loves it.
Yesterday I met up with my dearest friends, and my friend's girlfriend told me how she was chatting with her friend some time ago, and they both agreed on how I looked like I came straight out of a movie last time we met.
Ngl, lately I didn't feel good about my appearance, so this really lifted my spirit. I thought I was going to melt both of these times lol.
"
happy,I am in 9th grade and I was just going through so kinda rough times my ex was spreading rumors and her friend (a boy) wanted to jump me with a group of friends and it finally stopped. I had a track meet today and I couldn't run in the meet because I got injured in gym class (sprained knee). So I was taking times for all the running events and this one girl (senior) did a really good job on hurdles. When I got in the car the first thing I did was add her on snap to give her congrats on doing so well and it turned into us getting to know each other and then I asked her if being an adult is hard and she told me it wasent and reassured me it's actually fun because you can drive and get more jobs. We ended up talking about our plans for out of high school. This girl helped my fears of adulthood and actually made me exited for it.
happy,"After 3 years of trying and IVF I'm now in my 28th week of pregnancy. 

My contract at work is ending before I go on maternity leave and I can't wait to have extra time to do all kinds of stuff for baby and the house in general. 

My husband is amazing and supportive in every way imaginable. 

My relationship with my parents have strengthened over the last couple of years and especially now that I'm pregnant. 

My friends write to me often even if we don't have as much time to see each other as we would like. 

I'm so happy I could burst with joy and gratitude. 

I wish everyone could feel this feeling but I'm scared if I talk too much about all the good things in my life it would come of as bragging?

Does anyone else have these thoughts?
How should I deal with it?

Thank you in advance and sorry for formatting I'm on my phone. "
happy,"This is so weird , but a few days ago my boyfriend and I went into a little no-contact stage after a small argument we had over something petty . 

It wasn’t specific or anything but we both just stopped reaching out and got busy . 


Well yesterday after like 2 days of no contact , I go to message him on instagram and the second my message delivered, I received a message from him on text message 😂 

We literally messaged each other at the exact same moment after 2 days and were thinking of each other exactly at the same moment 

So adorable haha "
happy,"My family and I were a bit worried about her.  She’s 12 and we found something on her paw that we thought might have been a tumor.

Ten minutes ago we got a call indicating that it’s not.  I’m thrilled.  "
happy,"Lately I've been into collage thanks to the algorithm making me watch videos of scrapbooking and journaling. I've never been good with handmade stuff and I'm very conscious of it because I've never been ""excellent"" with that type of stuff. But that videos are really nice to watch and I keep thinking I want to do it too.

As soon as I told my husband that I wanted to try it he lent me his account for buying the materials even though we're on a tight budget (I had surgery recently because of a broken bone in my left hand). He never said ""You can't do it"", ""You aren't good with those things"", ""You only do it because of the videos"" or other stupid things I thought when I decided to tell him I wanted to try it. He even said it was nice because I could do it as rehab for my hand... It's been a week since then and he's following our orders and even helping me do my first collages because there's some things I still can't do with my hand.

I was afraid that as I finished my first one he would notice I'm terrible at it and maybe he would be mad for spending that money but quite the contrary he said it looked good and encouraged me to keep going.

He's not only aknowledging my desire to try a new hobby as valid but also he's giving me courage to challenge myself in things I always felt unsuited for.

 I'm really thankful for him..."
happy,"Five years ago I didn't see a future for myself at all. I was sleeping in my rideshare rental car, was in a crappy part time job that I hated, and was living with severe anxiety. Sixteen months ago, I took a chance and decided to give school another try. Thanks to financial aid and scholarships, tuition assistance from my current job, and support from a lot of people around me, I now have an AA in Political Science and graduated Phi Theta Kappa with honors. I have gotten offers from several schools to transfer/finish my BA, including some really good schools (one is an Ivy League school). I've wanted to move to the East Coast (NYC area) since I was 15 and finally have the opportunity at the end of this year, and will be finishing my BA there. My dream is to become a history teacher; history is AWESOME because it helps us to learn about so many facets of society and humanity, and education is a very noble, yet very under-appreciated field that I wish more people would look into. Learning is magical, and as long as we are alive, we have a chance to learn something new."
happy,I was able to buy the house mostly using money my mother left after she passed away.  And I think she'd be proud and happy knowing the hard work she put in while she was alive helped give me a new chance.  She always wanted me to live happy and now I am.
happy,it’s all..we are happy and it’s beautiful 
happy,"So I’m 17 and an engineering intern. I started last year mid-February and it’s been going pretty good. At Christmas, I got a $330 bonus ($200 after taxes) and I was super happy with that. Today, my boss stopped by my office and said they usually give out year end bonuses but their system wasn’t working right this year so it was a bit late. He said to remember that I’m only really part time and when I said I appreciate it no matter what he said “it’s better than a stick in the eye”. 

So after he said that, I thought it was gonna be like $100 max right, but I open it and see ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS!! It’s $640 after taxes and I know that isn’t a ton to some people BUT I AM SUPER HAPPY. And yesterday I found out I’m getting $1500 back in taxes so I am going to be absolutely ballin!!!! HELL YEAH!!!"

happy,"SO and I are gen x, come from suuuuuper broken homes. We met just over ten years ago, are celebrating our 9th wedding anniversary today. We’re having Jimmy John’s to celebrate while we save money for the move. 

He comes from the troubled teen industry, I come from your standard fucked up adolescence. 

We’ve been apartment dwellers since we met and have talked about a house but it had to be damn near perfect to make us commit. It was a long distance dream we clung to in our darkest hours. 

We found one.  Georgian Colonial, made from brick. It’s gonna last generations, like us. It has a small waterfall in the backyard, only a few neighbors, lots of trees and privacy. The Seller sat on the house until he found the “right” buyers and it turns out that was us. We got one hell of a deal. We’re paying less than half a mil for a house that’s worth 3/4 of a mil easily. 

We don’t feel like we deserve it but we’re damned if we won’t enjoy it. 

I’m a firm believer that the Universe gives you what you need. Not god, not fate, but something similar. I don’t know, but it seems like there was a time we needed something, and it’s been provided, and it’s not the first time. 

We needed a larger apartment? One was open in the same complex. We needed a family type car? First one we looked at was perfect. SO’s job sucked monkey balls? Here’s a random call about one and oh, hey, we’ll pay to interview and move you … 

We’re just so fucking happy right now and it sucks to share that with friends and family who aren’t necessarily feeling it. 

I wish I could share this feeling with all of you. 

"
happy,"Not that we are the type of people who stick to a planning but it is showing us that we have something’s that are definitely worth while and got stuff to be excited about! 

Like: we’ll be married for 10 years.

Our kids will each get at least 10 one on one dates  with either parent. 

There will be concerts and date nights 

Birthdays and an unicorn party 

I’m looking forward to a happy 2024"
happy,"Hi, Everyone.

I was going to wait a week, but I had to create an account and post this because I’m just too happy to keep it inside anymore.

A few days ago, my wife posted on this board. She was having a tough time sleeping, and in the middle of this rough night, the thought of something I did brought a smile to her face. She shared that moment with everyone here, and in response, the amount of goodwill and kindness that flowed from this community was overwhelming. 

She kept this post secret from me—never expecting it to make other than a few people smile. Little did she know, it would gain a ton of traction. The generosity and support that followed made it tough for her to conceal, and eventually, she showed me the thought that made her so happy this past Monday at 3 A.M..

My wife is amazing. I’m so happy, lucky, and fortunate to be in that group of people who have truly found their soulmate. My heart becomes full just thinking about her, and sometimes I just say her name randomly because it makes me happy to hear. I love her so much, and I can’t stop smiling right now.

I also want to take a moment to thank everyone in this community. What you all did truly shows the amazing types of people you are. From the messages of encouragement, to the acts of support, it’s a been such a joy. I’ll never forget any of it, and when I called my mother to tell her about what everyone here did, it seriously made her day.

Thank you all so much. You made my wife happy. You made my mom happy. For that, I will forever be grateful, and I promise to do my best to spread all the positive energy you gave us back out into the world.

This truly is the bright center of the Internet."
happy,"
I've been in a really good mood lately. 

I just had a woman hit on me for the first time ever the other day. I was super nervous, but it left me feeling amazing.

And recently I've somehow (through no real effort on my part) managed to become surrounded by very thoughtful, kind, and genuine people.

I've felt more at ease with my life in general.

It almost feels like my world turned around on it's own, and it brought a lot of joy into my life."
happy,Those birds that everyone used to hear in the morning are coming back. They all migrated about six years ago with no explanation and now they are back
happy,She's asleep right now next to me. My phone took a poop so she said that I could use hers so I thought I'd make a post like this. You don't have to upvote I'm just posting it just for the sake of her finding it one day. 
happy,"After four years - a first year in lockdown and a second year with near-daily debilitating panic attacks - I finally have friends at university. 

Before this year, I never showed up to course events, social events, nothing - I thought that cliques had already formed and it was way too late. 

This year, I challenged myself by going to events, and I found that people weren’t as closed off as I thought they’d be. 

I’m finally being invited to parties and karaoke nights, etc., I feel like I’m a part of a group in a way I never have been before.  

I’m so proud of myself for going out of my comfort zone and being confident as I could. 

Note: this kind of social life doesn’t equal happiness for everyone! I have many introverted moments, I can promise you that."

(I hope this is allowed here, I don't really know where else to post it I'm just so excited)
"
happy,"Hit my lowest point ever a few months ago. Went out to the train tracks to end it all, not gonna lie. The cause was the ending of a five year relationship, naively thinking that they were the 'one' and all that junk. 

What saved me, and is keeping me going, is... the various friends I made along my healing journey (seriously, both new and old friends really stepped up to help), discovering awesome new hobbies (photography, boxing, fishing, etc), rediscovering the joy in old hobbies (cycling, foraging, language learning, etc), learning to love myself, helping others (got stuck focusing all my love on one person), becoming more involved in my community, and just letting go of my frustrations and anxieties and just living in the moment! 

And... the cherry on top is that I ended up meeting this pretty awesome friend who I'm, honestly, relating to and vibing with. Life is like ""hey, you're doing great with self love and healing, here's your reward: a friend who is almost identical to you, enjoy!"" Hahahaha so awesome! 

Looking forward to being done with university next year and being able to live a happy and fulfilling life :) and so many other dreams and goals to look forward to!"

happy,"So for the past 3 months I’ve been managing the little money I had since work stopped paying us but it wasn’t just my office apparently it was the whole country like everyone working under the government wasn’t getting paid or isn’t getting paid let me say it was just a week  ago my sister even said they paid them but other offices not yet. Eventually my money finished and I ended with things I needed to do but had no money and worst of all a few days ago my cousin kept bugging me about a money I owed her this really made me so worried because I hate owing people money and hate people thinking I’m deliberately refusing to pay them but I really didn’t have the money 

I even cried because it’s not like I could borrow from someone else to pay her because no one ever believes me when I say I’m broke they just think I want to get more money or they think she is from a rich family her parents definitely give her money whenever she wants. They don’t, my parents have never believed in giving their kids everything, I mean they give other peoples kids everything but not theirs so I guess everyone would think they treat us the same way but it’s not like that 

Anyways today my mom called and said hey I sent you some money and the first thing I said what do you need me to get for you or pay or who should I send it to because that usually it and she said no it’s for you. For a second I thought she was joking and I was like what did you say I should do with this money, and she said it’s for you. I was so happy I wanted to cry. So I asked can I really use this money and she goes yes. I don’t know how she knew I needed money so badly because I didn’t tell anyone but I guess she could tell since she is my mom and I love her so much. Though it didn’t solve all my problems it solved the one I was most worried about it. My mom didn’t need to send me the money but she did and I’m so grateful for that

Update: I got paid today finally 😊. Thanks for the sweet comments my mom really is a great mom. I feel like her sending me that money had something to do with me finally getting paid after 3 months. Maybe a coincidence or something I don’t know but I just want to believe that. Though I only got paid for one month it’s still better than nothing "
happy,"I quit my job but now worried about money

Quit my job, but worried about money.

I had to do something very hard today. I had to quit my job. It was not a decision I took lightly. Unfortunately it was my first real job and it was sponsored by vocational rehab, which makes me feel bad about quitting. However, I need to prioritize my mental health. I am a 25 year old individual living with multiple disabilities including type 1 diabetes, adhd and anxiety. The job was causing me a lot of stress and anxiety. I spent 4 hours at the therapy office yesterday. They are also adjusting my anxiety medication, I’m still testing adhd meds. I would like to work but I’m not sure what I want to do. Sitting around and collecting disability is not an option. There has to be something im good at. Both my boss and vocational rehab are proud of me for prioritizing my mental health. However, I am still worried about money, despite the fact that I live with my parents. If I don’t work, I won’t be able to have an income. Money is a big stressor in my life. And I’m also trying to not feel like a failure. Maybe I can craft or sell something on etsy. Or freelance/gig work. There has to be something I’m good at. I’m just not sure what. My plan for now is to priorize my mental health, and I asked my therapy office if I was able to come in twice a week so we shall see what they say. I’m probably not the first one to quit my job due to stress. But I’m afraid I’m
The first one to quit their first job. Thank you for taking time to read this post. It was very hard for me to write."
happy,"today i got in a car accident. i wasn't doing well lately and that car accident and the headache made me go in deep episode of depression. 

later i found myself in a ai image generator. i asked it to make one of my happiest days in the not so happy life of mine. and you know what? it didn't disappoint me.

this is a date i had with my love of life. it was beautiful day. i wore red polo shirt that she gave me in my birthday (she is one of 2 people who cares about my birthday) and she wore this outfit (pink skirt, white shir, pink hijab) that she wore in the day that i started loving her. before that we used to be friends, and we spoke a lot. i used to think of her as the coolest girl out there. and she thought of me like this as well (yes i said cool, yes we were young and yes i still do think of her as the coolest girl out ther). one day we decide to meet, i went to to that location, when i saw her from a distance and she smiled at me from far, wearing this outfit it i fall in love, 

we met to give her her birthday present (black hijab from the type she loves so much but she didn't have a black one, and inside of it i put a kindder surprise as a extra surprise for later).

so later in the relationship after i confessed and growing together loving each other more and more, we met in one of our walk dates (dates is kinnda illegal here) i wore this shirt that she gave me and a bracelet that she made for me before my confession (really sweet gift), and she wore my favorite outfit she had (she knows how to make me happy).

in this date we hold hands for the first time ever. we have been loving each other for over a year and half by now. (i know it may be something alien to most of you but we live in different place with different rules.)

so this is a small part of our story. it made me happy to remember these days even with all of my cournt problems.


thank you for reading. i hope you have a happy day as well <3"
happy,"I have the best in-laws, they spoil me more than their own son! I volunteer at a pig sanctuary, so when my MIL saw this she said she just had to get it for me. I’m so lucky 🥰"
happy,"I saw an FZR400 at a bike show last year and knew that it was my bike. I needed one for when I passed my A2. I was told to try a bike I could ""fit on"", and to get something smaller like my boyfriend's CBR400RR. But I got what I WANTED, not what I felt I had to settle for. And now I've started riding it on the road, I can confidently say that I'm so incredibly happy and proud of myself for getting the bike I wanted 🥰"
happy,Very damn well pleased with myself.
happy,"Today I've been feeling stressed due to personal family issues, and I've been mentally ruminating on these issues for 1-2 hours. When I got to the gym (thankfully by myself) I was still ruminating. That changed when I got to my last exercise, sumo deadlifts (I like to save the best exercises for last). I hit a 5 RM sumo deadlift today, and my mood was uplifted. 

Now I'm happy AND proud I hit a milestone!! :)"
happy,"It took a lot of saving, moving things around financially, and sacrificing. I’m looking to improve my finances (and my life) in the future, but it’s good to have hope for once. Really was worried I’d miss the deadline. 

Sorry, I known I’ve been a problem , and I have no one who really cares enough in my life to share this with. Thank you guys for allowing me."

happy,"Quit my job

Recently quit my full time job. Was a good position and good pay but my manager went behind my back and basically just gave my position away and expected me to take the demotion purely because she was struggling at the other location and needed me back there to help. It was nothing to do with me or my work as I was really good at my job (don't mean to be bigheaded) but she allowed this other lady to introduce herself to all my colleagues as the manager of my location when they all know that i was there. 
I was really upset because it made it look like it was because I couldn't do my job and she completely broke any trust I had for her. I loved my job and I'm pretty upset BUT I stood up for myself and didn't stand for the lack of respect and told her where to go. I'm proud of myself for doing so and happy I'm no longer working under her. I'm confident I'll get a good job again that gives me the respect and decency I'm owed.

Just needed a lil rant lol don't mind me"
happy,"This is gonna start off sad, but I swear it gets better. 

August 2021 I graduated college. October 2021 I was given a job offer for a career I was incredibly excited about. The job offer payed decently, and was a stepping stone for my ex-gf and I at the time to be able to start moving our relationship into a more adult-relationship; ie, moving out, buying a house, etc. 

January 2022 I started at my job and loved it. March 2022 came around, and my ex at the time had blind-sided me and left without a word. I was devastated at the time. Fast forward a few months to October, I’m at the gym and I feel a tendon in the back of my leg snap. I can’t walk. I eventually go to the doctor who just diagnoses me with a strain and tells me to go to PT. 

Long story short, I visited 2 different doctors. Both of whom could not give me a proper diagnosis which caused the PT I received to only make things worse. I was on disability from my job to take care of my leg which just wouldn’t get better, as well as therapy for depression. Eventually, I was forced to leave my job, lost my health insurance, and didn’t know if I’d ever be able to walk again. I was alone, depressed, disabled, unemployed, and had no idea about the future and what was going to happen to me. 

Eventually, I found a physio who I was able to see via Zoom (about $20/visit, so I could afford it without insurance) who was able to diagnose me and we started a PT program that I was able to do by myself. It took a long time, but she got me back on my feet, back in the gym, back to running and everything. It took me about a year to walk again. It was an extremely long process. 

Near the end of my PT, I met this woman. Smart, funny, gorgeous, kind, driven and hard working, incredibly emotionally intelligent, and… well I could go on for hours talking about this woman. We hit it off, and started dating. She’s introduced me to so many new hobbies, many of which are active activities. Some team sports, and some individual sports. I’ve started some new sports of my own, and have began to introduce her to them as well. Not only has meeting her changed my life romantically, but I’ve also gotten very close to all of her friends of which she has many. When my leg didn’t work and I lost my job, I was alone almost 24/7. I had very little help with anything from family and friends. It was the darkest time of my life. Now, I feel like it’s one of the most social and happiest times of my life. It’s been a complete 180 from where I was before. 

When my leg got better, I also applied for a federal job. I’d always wanted to work for the federal government, not just for the benefits but also for the job security. It was a very long and stressful process, but just last week I received the email with a firm job offer and I am due to begin working with them next week. 

My life has completely changed. I was in the darkest time of my life, not knowing what was going to happen to me and not knowing if I’d ever be able to walk again, hold a job, etc. I’ve now picked up a handful of new hobbies, I’m exercising and running frequently, I have a new career which I’m beyond ecstatic to begin, and a wonderful girlfriend of which I can see an actual future with. 

Words cannot begin to describe how absolutely ecstatic I am for what my future holds. "
happy,"
So I’ve officially made it a month away from drinking and about 2 months away from morphine. And considering all the shit I’ve been through recently and the fact I was drinking a handle of vodka every school week and every weekend for over a year I am incredibly proud of myself for not relapsing. I went from chugging my last drink in last then 30 seconds to only smoking an 8th in like a week. I’m also kinda happy cuz I just turned 16 and now I don’t have to worry about me being stupid and trying to drink and drive. Honestly all of this only happened because my girl didn’t like me when I was  drunk. and considering I’m not the only one in my family who has had a drinking problem and I’ve seen how alcohol ruined my grandparents marriage and eventually led to my grandfathers death at 45 I honestly feel kinda strong for once."
happy,"We’ve had some pretty intense rain, heat and humidity over the past few weeks where I live, and it resulted in my garden going absolutely nuts with weeds. There wasn’t much I could do because it was either raining or so hot I would get heat stroke if I tried. So the last three days i spent a couple of hours each (still in the 30s Celsius) pulling the weeds. The first photo was taken after I had already pulled two garbage bags of weeds from the edge of the concreted space."
happy,"I asked for help here on Reddit and a kind redditor answered. It was nice hitting the gas station and dollar menu fast food spot across the street not needing to worry about the cost. Rarely do I actually worry about the cost but at the moment I am in a pickle. I then went home and spent a few hours replacing the ballast on my busted headlight. I showered, and am now in bed just happy. I’ve been the “fix it” ticket guy at the court house and I just don’t want to continue bothering the police department with my lack of due diligence for my slowly ailing car. Luckily I didn’t get any infractions for the headlight out but it works now! It’s a nice car for me, unfortunately it’s just so old and I am not financially ahead enough on everything to pay the amount it needs; that’s why I work on it myself. Pay day is just around the corner and I’m just happy and feeing secure bundled up.  "

happy,"I was infantry, and I used to feel a certain amount a guilt having never killed.  Think of it as survivors guilt in a way, of others have to carry that burden what makes me so special?  But the older I get, the more I’m just all around glad and relieved.  We all think we will be fine when we join, but as you mature you realize there’s no telling how you’ll react.  I can finally, at least for today, say I’m perfectly fine having never been in that situation.  Some may look down on this, but kiss my ass after Taco Bell "
happy,She's asleep right now next to me. My phone took a poop so she said that I could use hers so I thought I'd make a post like this. You don't have to upvote I'm just posting it just for the sake of her finding it one day. 
happy,"I love people. I find it so fascinating how incredibly intricate every single person is, and there’s billions of us! I genuinely love seeing people walking outside or at school. I’m excited to see my friends, yes, but I also love the fact that I get to see everyone else’s faces every day. I’ve never really empathized with those that say they hate the majority of people. I get being hurt and losing the ability to trust, I can understand it, but I don’t think I could really just hate people in general. I love people’s faces, not just the eyes, but the noses and the smiles and the way skin crinkles. I get so excited at the prospect of meeting new people, because that’s one more entire life I get to interact with! That person an entire world of inner thought and experiences that is allowing me to take part in their experience of the world. Idk I just really love people a whole lot."
happy,"Hey all! I've been on the weightloss train for nearly 3-4 years now! I am only 5',3"", so at my biggest of 215lbs, I was quite heavy for my size. 
I began to simply just eat less, take in less sugar, reduce my portions, and begin walking (10k steps a day). 
Towards the end of my journey I began running and working out as well, which helped me over come plateaus, as well as reducing sugar to nearly 0. 
I am now 120lbs. I may lose 5 more pounds to be 115lbs, but we'll see. It took me nearly half a decade, but I can rest now knowing it is finally accomplished! "
happy,"

I guess I'm just trying to put some good vibes for myself out on a night where I feel rather low. I honestly didn't think I could get this far but since February I've lost 32lbs according to my scale this morning. It's probably more once I poop...if I poop."
happy,"There was this local Mexican joint housed inside a run-down, little-used gas station. Classic ""hole in the wall"" type setup, which should have been this community's first clue that the food would be stupendous. They had these chorizo burritos with spicy sauce that just spoke to me on some metaphysical level.

Unfortunately, last summer they announced they were shutting down. They just weren't making enough money. I was despondent -- nothing else in this two-horse town even came close to approximating the culinary excellence this place provided.

They reopened yesterday. I was finally able to get in there today, and I swear to you that the clouds parted and angels sang as I took my first bite. It's every bit as good as I remembered.

I'm recommending them to everybody I know and hoping they manage to hold on this time."
happy,"It was just a passing comment during a phone call. To be honest, I kind of forgot I even mentioned it . Today I found a package on my doorstep.


Still can't figure out if it's a cat or a rabbit. There are two modes, rainbow and normal light. What should I name it?"
happy,"I never thought giving a gift would make me so happy. I live in India and my best friend always had this big desire to visit a special place for worshipping Krishna. Unfortunately, that place is very far away. But then I found out there is a similar place much closer to where we live, so I decided to take her there as a surprise.

I didn't tell her where I intended to take her. I just asked her when she had her holidays and around christmas we planned the trip. It took 4 hours to reach there and when we were just about to reach I gave her a note saying 'We will visit your favourite place one day soon. Until that time enjoy this little surprise from me'. When we were at front gate and she realized where we were she became so mesmerised. Seeing her so happy I felt very gratified. That was the first time I realized that love is about giving cause the more you give the more blissful you become.

We visited every temple, the people were chanting Hare Krishna and she was enjoying every little thing. She even took some of the soil from there as a memory. Seeing that she loved my surprise there was different level of joy within me and I truly felt what Sadhguru says 'How deeply you touch another life is how rich your life is'."
happy,"I (25m) have been going out with a coworker of mine (23f) for about a month now after flirting for a few weeks before that. I've been pretty gushy the whole time, but she has some baggage from a past relationship ship that's made it hard for her to fully commit to relationship. 

Well last week, one of our other coworkers told me that she actually refered to me as her boyfriend for the first time while complaining that our manager didn't give us more shifts together, and a couple days ago she called me for the first time instead of the texting we've been doing to tell me she loves me. 

This is my first relationship since a meaningless highschool situationship, and I am just over the moon and need to get this off my chest"
happy,"We found her about 10 years ago as a stray in NYC and she's been with us ever since. She got out of a window once and was gone for over 24 hours but she came back, almost knocking at the front door.   
She's been my little special buddy for so many years now and knowing I can still scoop her up and give her kisses warms my heart. She's got the best personality and she's very friendly and affectionate - basically the ideal cat. Snuggles with me like a teddy bear almost every night. She's so perfect she has a heart marking on her side!  


I just needed to happyrant about my wonderful kitty. Gave her some love a moment ago and wanted to share it :)

happy,"I think I may have perfected my winged liner on slightly hooded eyes! And I tried out a purple liner which makes my brown eyes pop, especially the hazel and green flecks. Just super excited about it and wanted to share!"
happy,One of my closest friends went to NYC in an au pair exchange and I painted one of my favorite photos of us  with watercolor and then I gave it to her at the airport before she got on the plane! 💗 She loved btw and it's now on her bedside table in her bedroom at her host family house. 
happy,"hi- new-ish to reddit but just wanted to say that i’m happy with where i am in life right now. from last august-the end of the year i had no job and bills were draining my savings. 
after spending so much during the holidays, i NEEDED to get a job after the new year. it became my unspoken resolution. so after my guests left, i started applying. 
now, here I am, a SOLID paycheck in. PLUS i’m supporting a super cool small business!
i can’t wait to start saving up again. last year was rough. 
cheers! stay happy!"

happy,"I was a mess for two decades, booze, coke, just whatever. I have now made it two years without a drink or any coke. I'm so happy right now.

happy,"So, my brother and I were walking to the store just to pick up some stuff. We got in and I went to the drinks section, to get a flavoured water. Some kid who looked a little older than us was half-way blocking the drink I needed to get (I don't care, I'm really patient), and when he noticed, immediately apologized and moved. I felt bad, I said ""no, it's alright!"", and he mumbled something inaudible to me afterwards, but smiled, so did I. 

My brother and I got our items, and were waiting in line. It was just the guy from the drinks section in front of us. He payed for his stuff, then handed a 10 dollar bill to the worker, and said, ""That's to pay for them"", pointing to us, whilst exiting the store. We thanked him, and he said ""You guys are nice"", and he was out of the store. It all happened really fast, but it paid for our stuff. We left and his dad or someone was already driving away. He waved, and we did too. It was just really sweet I thought. I hadn't had that happened to me before."
happy,"SO and I are gen x, come from suuuuuper broken homes. We met just over ten years ago, are celebrating our 9th wedding anniversary today. We’re having Jimmy John’s to celebrate while we save money for the move. 

He comes from the troubled teen industry, I come from your standard fucked up adolescence. 

We’ve been apartment dwellers since we met and have talked about a house but it had to be damn near perfect to make us commit. It was a long distance dream we clung to in our darkest hours. 

We found one.  Georgian Colonial, made from brick. It’s gonna last generations, like us. It has a small waterfall in the backyard, only a few neighbors, lots of trees and privacy. The Seller sat on the house until he found the “right” buyers and it turns out that was us. We got one hell of a deal. We’re paying less than half a mil for a house that’s worth 3/4 of a mil easily. 

We don’t feel like we deserve it but we’re damned if we won’t enjoy it. 

I’m a firm believer that the Universe gives you what you need. Not god, not fate, but something similar. I don’t know, but it seems like there was a time we needed something, and it’s been provided, and it’s not the first time. 

We needed a larger apartment? One was open in the same complex. We needed a family type car? First one we looked at was perfect. SO’s job sucked monkey balls? Here’s a random call about one and oh, hey, we’ll pay to interview and move you … 

We’re just so fucking happy right now and it sucks to share that with friends and family who aren’t necessarily feeling it. 

I wish I could share this feeling with all of you.

happy,"I'm genderfluid and used to be FTM but decided to stop taking testosterone at the end of last year so my periods have been incredibly painful. 

In fact one of the many reasons I started to take it to begin with when I was 18 was years old and prior to that my period cramps were unbearable to the point I went to the hospital (probably due to low iron). 

My lover is an accomplished music producer and has a Dragon Ball cover song he's trying to wrap up for his audience on YouTube as soon as possible and while he's more than happy to have my company, he has to fully focus on his projecting order to meet his deadline. 

My time of month came in a few days ago and my cramps have been pretty intense, and he did have to experience having to see / hear me deal with all of the pain. 

So last night while he was focused and I was watching and episode of My Hero Academia he was letting his project play in the back ground, snuck behind me and started to give me the most amazing back rub in the universe. 

We already have such a wonderful and wholesome relationship but this made me feel so nice and relieved I wanted to post about it. His older brother is an RMT so his family definitely had some some of gene of being good with their hands when it comes to massages 🤤"
happy,"This is very small, but I haven't stopped thinking about it since it happened and it makes me happy! Sorry, this might get long.

I have a weird role at my job and it was created when I was hired so there were no processes or procedures in place. It's listed as a Customer Experience Specialist role, but I am involved in every aspect of the company. One thing that's evolved, that definitely wasn't part of the job, is that coworkers confide in me knowing I have a ""loose lips sink ships"" mentality. I never reveal details or gossip, but if I'm concerned about something/someone I'll roundabout bring it up to management. 

On Friday one of my direct teammates was venting pretty hard and I went to my manager to say I was concerned this person may be experiencing burnout and I'm not sure how long they'll be with the company.  My boss said he noticed it too and if they need to leave for their mental wellbeing it's understandable and there are contingency plans in place. Then he said, all except you, there's no contingency plan if we lose you. 

Folks, I know everyone is replaceable, but this made me feel so valued and seen. I already love my job, but this was icing on the cake. 

Thank you for reading. "

I'm so appreciative of all of y'all's support! I was worried if I was overstaying my welcome on this sub, but y'all were so supportive! For anyone starting their fitness journey from my posts, or anyone who is in their own fitness journey, I'm so proud of you! I'd like to address a couple thing so constantly see in the replies.

No, this is not a karma farm. Anyone who values karma so much they lie and take advantage of peoples kindness is an idiot. If you still believe this is a karma farm, that's fine but please don't be rude to or others who just want to improve their lives.

I don't really have friends or family to talk about it with so l'm posting here if that's okay. Started from an entry position analyst to engineer in 5 years, now I'm here after 4 more years. I don't have my parents anymore so I guess I'll look for phrase on Reddit 🩷"
happy," For some quick context I am an adult male. So to get right into what the title says. My whole life I always felt ""fat"" or ""ugly"". I'm not really sure what had convinced me to think this. I would not starve myself but would purposefully avoid meals or avoid drinking literally anything. This was the case for a good majority of my life so far (I'm 18 now just for reference). This train of thought, obviously damaged my self image, just leading to even more self conflicting issues. around the age of 15 I realized that I wasn't straight, turns out I was bisexual, (""great another reason to hate myself""). I felt even more isolated from others in my life. When I was 17, I accidently came out to my brother and step-mom, I remember going back to my room silently panicking, then venting to my best friend over text. The very next day my dad was joking around and said something like ""you saving yourself for that perfect girl....or BOY!?"" and I very stupidly said yes to both, realizing what I said made me internally panic again. To my surprise, my dad (who is Christian) was very very okay with it. For the days I almost began to cry on my way to school, due to the amount of weight lifted off of me. through the last remaining months of the year I felt like I was finally being accepted. To speed up this annoyingly long story, during the months leading up to and past my 18th birthday I was hit like a truck with a wave of sadness, tried something that I'm really happy it didn't workout, opened up to my step-mom and dad about it , got therapy, and processed my feelings healthily. This lasted for a 3-4 month period. Now in the year 2024 I still have my issues that I solve, but I have this underlying feeling of pure happiness that just sits dormant inside of me. I'm not sure if its an underlying issue problem of mine. Almost every time I go to take a shower I spot myself in the mirror (I'm usually fully clothed or just shirtless). I would stop and jokingly flex and check out myself (too clarify the mirror was only tall enough to show from above my head down and about to slightly above the waist), then proceed with my shower. Even today, I felt a surge of 5 am confidence and decided to open obs and take off my shirt and started to pose and check out myself out a bit and I thought in an exaggerated way ""omg I'm kinda... hot!"". Just being able to type this story out makes me feel so much appreciation for just life and how far I have progressed in my life. I know this sounds very cheesy, but I feel that if I were to meet younger self, my younger self would be very proud of us. I still feel random surges of sadness every now and then, but I usually break free from those episodes within the week. I can now confidently and proudly say that I'm happier now than I ever been in my ongoing life, and I know now that I'm not alone and I wont ever be. So as I go to end this embarrassingly long post, I want you, the reader to know you're loved and cared about. Sorry if this is hard to understand or if the grammar is a horror show to yall, I've been contemplating typing and posting this for a stupid amount of time and plus its almost 7 am. "
happy,"This is a long, very happy rant. I can't rant out of happiness this hard to anyone in my life rn

I am so happy. I can't stop talking about my glasses and it's probably getting annoying, because everyone has glasses. But I feel like a lot of people just got glasses when they first started needing them and didn't just have terrible vision that was ignored for most of their lives to the point of developing eye problems over it, and then suddenly get it corrected like in an instant, and I literally cannot shut up about it. What I thought was pretty normal vision was actually complete dogshit and now I am seeing things I couldn't even imagine a few weeks ago.

And holy shit. I pretty much immediately got hit with the heavy fist of depth perception for the first time in my life and spent like half an hour touching the sink and putting my hands in the corners of the room because everything was suddenly EXTREMELY 3D. I feel like I am in an actual video game. I used to joke that video games are higher definition than my actual vision but not right now.

Everything is so BRIGHT. Everything is so DETAILED. Grass doesn't all blend together anymore, everything on my shelf is a distinct individual object, I can see a face a few feet away, hell I can read something across the street. It's nuts. Colours are so sharp and saturated now, life isnt a foggy haze around me, everything is in such intense focus and detail I keep just staring at little things and tearing up. 

AND I CAN ACTUALLY READ OH MY GOD. I've been afraid to Crack open a novel because I'm afraid it's going to be too good to be true, but as far as scrolling on my phone, sentences and words are so crisp and distinct. I don't have to hold it at right up to my actual nose, close one eye and squint just to have my eye bounce all over the page and give me a headache after about one sentence. 

And better, I haven't had double vision in days. I used to get it every day like clockwork around 2pm until the end of the day. Since putting on my glasses, I guess my brain just. Isn't trying to mash together two extremely different visual fields anymore and giving up or something (I'm not a doctor, that makes sense to me though)

I'm just losing my mind. I never want to take them off. I have to force myself to take them off at bedtime. I want to order 500 pairs and put them on a special shelf like a shrine lol. I have never been more greatful for anything before.

It's insane how bad I let this get under the guise of ""it's always been like this, it was like this when I grew up, can't imagine it gets that much better than this now."" It's like the Crack in your windshield that you eventually stop noticing until your windshield explodes."
happy,"I'm big into the local music scene as a local musician, amateur gig photographer, and just general lover of grassroots music. For my birthday, my boyfriend secretly set-up a non-profit music promoter enterprise, booked four of my favourite local bands to play at a local grassroots venues on my birthday weekend, and arranged for all ticket sales to go to one of my favourite local charities! 

It's without a doubt the most thoughtful thing anyone has ever done for me, and I'm totally blown away by it!

happy,"I went septic 2 years ago due to a kidney stone that was obstructing my kidneys flows but after almost  3 YEARS (and it growing 2mm) its out due to me going to the ER and getting medicine because I knew something was wrong!

Listen to your body, and advocate as much as you need!"
happy,"2 years ago, my partner worked at Habitat for Humanity as a family coordinator, where she would help families apply, understand the criteria, and screen families for eligibility. There was a lovely immigrant family of 4, a mom, dad, teenage son, and younger daughter who were incredibly sweet and hardworking. The problem was that they applied 4 times, and each time, they either had just the smallest bit over income or they were not selected. My partner saw how hard working they were and how much this would turn their life around. They lived in a small 1 bedroom apartment and spending way too much on rent.  On the 5th application, my partner made sure that everything was correct, they were eligible, and she went to bat for them during committee selections, ensuring they got a house this time. They talked so often throughout the process and the mom called my partner her “daughter”, that is how close they became. Then one day, my partner gets home and tells me that this family got approved to get a new house after 2 years of rejections. I was floored with emotions as I had become so invested in their wellbeing. 

Now, my partner was the one that would be calling and letting the families know that they would be eligible to receive a home. I was so invested in this family that I made sure to listen to the phone call that she made to the mom of the family on speakerphone. As soon as she called, the mom thought something else was wrong and she didn’t get a home this round. Instead, my partner broke the news that they would be getting a house. That was when I immediately started balling my eyes out. I’m crying, my partner is crying, and the mom was crying.  It’s really hard to describe the amount of love the mom had for my partner and the gratitude she had for my partner doing everything she could to get them a home. I cried for a long time, even after they hung up. I’ve never felt so happy for someone else being so happy. To this day, when I think about that phone call, I tear up and could cry just like that day. I’ve never cried from happiness this way for anyone. As I write this, my eyes fill with tears thinking back to that beautiful moment. 

Later, the mom brought my partner a whole cake and other expressions of gratitude. It’s a moment that will stay with me for the rest of my life. Today, this family is thriving more than they ever have and we keep up with them. "
happy,"After being rejected for an early admission, and direct admission, I still tried to appeal for a third time to get into the college course I wanted. I just got the results that I was SUCCESSFUL!!!!!! I'M SO HAPPY I'M CRYING I MADE IT I MADE IT. I had absolutely no hope for if i didn't get accepted and was considering giving up entirely"

happy,"So I just impulsively bought train tickets to visit my boyfriend tomorrow! I had a few off days in work but the plane ticket was too expensive, so instead I bought the train tickets which will take around 10 hours to his city, nevertheless I bought it and by the time he’ll be finished with his job, he will see me waiting in front of his office which he has no idea about ! I can’t sleep thinking I’ll get to see him tomorrow and what kind of reaction he’ll be having ! Just today he was complaining that I came for only 4 days previous month & it’s not enough, we should be together more often and stuff! The train is really early in the morning and I should sleep but I can’t! I’m so happy and excited ! "
happy,"
I've been in a really good mood lately. 

I just had a woman hit on me for the first time ever the other day. I was super nervous, but it left me feeling amazing.

And recently I've somehow (through no real effort on my part) managed to become surrounded by very thoughtful, kind, and genuine people.

I've felt more at ease with my life in general.

It almost feels like my world turned around on it's own, and it brought a lot of joy into my life."
happy,"in late august/early september me (15m) and one of my friends (15m) decided to fake date each other for fun and after about a week of playful “fake dating” a mutual friend dmed me and told me to message my fake lover, so i did and with some prompting he confessed that he had actually fallen for me and i had suspected thats what this was about (being prompted to message him) and i was incredibly excited, i had only recently come to terms with my sexuality as gay and was more than happy to accept his feelings, we kinda took it slow because i was pretty nervous to say actually romantic things but we are in a happy relationship for a little over 4 months now! this is the longest and healthiest relationship ive been in and i genuinely want to marry this boy. just wanted to ramble about my perfect boyfriend and how we got together


moral of the story: fake date your friend whos knows what will happen 🤭"

happy,"Recently Ive opened myself up expanded my horizons and gotten with some really cool people, microbiologists, actresses from london, screenwriters from new york, Bob Ross trained painters, wave scientists, hang gliding instructors. 

Just wanted to put it out there and be grateful for the opportunities that have come my way in the last couple of months.

 Who would have thought that there were so many opportunities, experiences, and pretty faces out there.


“My troubles will be few”"
happy,"I’ve done an emotional 180 over the past two years for the better! These books have helped me more than therapy, antidepressants, and sleeping pills. Some of them contain spirituality but can be enjoyed by any religion. I tell everyone I know about them and just wanted to share here!"
happy,"* I've been consistently going to the gym for a year and three months, and I'm muscular now.

* Plus, I've got a good clean conscience.

I finally feel strong physically, emotionally, and intellectually now. I am confident in myself now. I have changed from weak to strong."
happy,"Poor thing was almost dried up. I put it in my houseplant, watered it, and stuck some dead leaves in the pot. Looking a little more closely at the pictures, I could’ve nursed it a little longer (was worried the pot was too small for it), but I tried my best. I didn’t see it at the time. Nonetheless, I am so glad it’s alive and better!

happy,We’ve been dating for a year and about five months? They picked me up from my apartment and we went to a really nice restaurant. I was panicking so much.
happy,"I'm genderfluid and used to be FTM but decided to stop taking testosterone at the end of last year so my periods have been incredibly painful. 

In fact one of the many reasons I started to take it to begin with when I was 18 was years old and prior to that my period cramps were unbearable to the point I went to the hospital (probably due to low iron). 

My lover is an accomplished music producer and has a Dragon Ball cover song he's trying to wrap up for his audience on YouTube as soon as possible and while he's more than happy to have my company, he has to fully focus on his projecting order to meet his deadline. 

My time of month came in a few days ago and my cramps have been pretty intense, and he did have to experience having to see / hear me deal with all of the pain. 

So last night while he was focused and I was watching and episode of My Hero Academia he was letting his project play in the back ground, snuck behind me and started to give me the most amazing back rub in the universe. 

We already have such a wonderful and wholesome relationship but this made me feel so nice and relieved I wanted to post about it. His older brother is an RMT so his family definitely had some some of gene of being good with their hands when it comes to massages 🤤"
happy,"I cleaned my house after living in a pretty big mess after 2 years. For context: I live with my mom and grandpa. my mom is a hoarder and also battles manic depression so she buys a lot of things to comfort herself (not hoarders tv show level but clothes, shoes, journals, pens, books). My grandpa hoards food (not sure why) and doesn’t like to get rid of anything even if it’s expired from 2019. I also can be messy and not put things back where they go. I spent a year being mad that I had to clean the place at all because I felt like I shouldn’t have to clean up after perfectly capable people and I knew they wouldn’t make an effort to keep it clean. I guess I got over that last week because I cleaned the entire house and had about 6 garbage bags full of things to throw out that hadn’t been used in years. What really prompted the clean was my mom essentially went to stay with her sister and didn’t give me any warning or anything. I guess I felt like if the house was clean she’d come back home. This was a super long rant but anyway I’m just proud of myself that I have continued the efforts of keeping the house clean and putting things back where they go even if my grandpa and mom don’t contribute because I realized if I want the house to stay clean, it’s going to have to be me doing the clean up. "
happy,"Over 2 years ago, a friend of ours passed away leaving 3 kids orphaned and a half sibling without a support system. My wife and I took in all 4 kids, as we were quite close with the kids. We got legal guardianship of the 2 youngest about 6 months after they moved in. The youngest is now 10. She started calling my wife ""Mommy"" about a year ago. This took some getting used to as all of our other kids call her ""Mom"". 

I however, remained Mr. MyFirstName. She has never had a dad before, and she had always called me that before she moved in. She gives me hugs everyday (now) and tells me she loves me frequently (yes, I know this won't last). So I was not worried about what she calls me. We went on a trip with my brother and his family, and sometime during the week, she just started calling me ""Daddy"". I'm not sure if it was because her cousin (my niece - 6F) calls my brother Daddy (a lot) or what caused it. At one point, we were at a theme park, and she was calling me Daddy over and over again, and I completely missed it, because I wasn't used to it and her voice is similar to my niece. My SIL grabs my arm and says ""Daddy!!!  Someone is calling you"". I felt awful, and so overjoyed at the same time. We've been home several days and I'm still Daddy (and getting used to it), but also Mr. MyFirstName sometimes too, but it still makes me smile.

  
We are hoping the adoption will be finalized this year. "
happy,"Howdy! 

I'm so appreciative of all of y'all's support! I was worried if I was overstaying my welcome on this sub, but y'all were so supportive! For anyone starting their fitness journey from my posts, or anyone who is in their own fitness journey, I'm so proud of you! I'd like to address a couple thing so constantly see in the replies. I'd rather address it on the post instead of individual comments. 

I do infact know I need a calorie deficit to lost consistent weight, and I've been on a calorie deficit since day 2

No, this is not a karma farm. Anyone who values karma so much they lie and take advantage of peoples kindness is an idiot. If you still believe this is a karma farm, that's fine but please don't be rude to or others who just want to improve their lives.

Yes, I know I'm fat, I know I'm unhealthy, you don't need to constantly spam in in the replies. Please come up with more insults because I'm running out of jokes. 

Sorry for the long post but I hope y'all have a great day, Cheers!"
happy,"She told me near the end of January of this year that she is gay. Since then she's been a lot more sociable and is flashing that gorgeous, radiant smile of hers a lot more often. She called me this morning (her mom has custody on weekends) and told me all about this girl and their date, and it's the happiest I've ever heard her sound.

I am so unbelievably proud of my little girl. I'm smiling ear to ear thinking about how happy she must be to be living as her true self. She is my world, and her happiness is my happiness."
happy,I (F18) talked to the army three months ago about joining just for the fun of it. I had no idea that I could get trained as an LPN. (I want to be a doctor one day so this will get me started in building my career) I signed my contract at MEPs yesterday. I'm really excited to be able to go to college and be able to move out of my parent's house!! 
happy,"I've always had trouble finding jeans or any kind of pants for most my life. I was either way too skinny or, after I started body building, my thighs were too big. No matter what though, the waist band was always waaaay too loose. 

Today I tried curvy fit jeans, I wish I had tried years sooner. They look so good on me!!! They fit just right. I always have to settle for the loose waistband. Not today!

The only unlucky part is I'm back down to a 00 pant size... Very hard to find on sale racks or in stores."
happy,"For me, the first thing I used to do was check my emails but it was super stressful, and also my whole day would be bad if the email was crucial and msg was bad but when I stumbled across this quote from Sadhguru life isn't the same. 'When you wake up in the morning, the first thing you should do is Smile. You are Alive! Is that not the greatest blessing and reason enough to Smile?'  
  
So every day when I wake up I smile not towards anybody, I just smile. This very small act has changed my attitude to look toward life :)

happy,"Hi Reddit! I’ve been trying to use my account as an outlet to manage my feelings and healing. I am so excited to share that I was finally able to mow my lawn, rake my leaves, and plant a few seeds in my yard today! Some backstory (trigger warning: SA), I was sexually assaulted by a man that lived on my street, and for the longest time, I was nervous to work on my yard in my front lawn because I did not want to see him. But, he finally moved out. I was so excited to see the moving truck near his house. I don’t have to hire a lawn crew anymore and I don’t have to take the long route walking to try and avoid this person. I am very excited and happy. I haven’t done my own yard work for a long time and I feel very good. 🥰"
happy,"Basically the title but my mum recently bought us tickets to see Hozier when he comes to Australia and she’s now teaching herself the lyrics to all his songs so she can sing along, what makes this better is that English is not her first language and she keeps asking me what some words mean so she can fully understand what his songs are about."

happy,"Around November of last year I (26F) matched with this guy(26M), he's honestly one of the sweetest guys I've met on a dating app. We were talking for a whole, but had to go out seprate ways, because he was unemployed then and looking for a job and had other things going on in his life. He felt like he couldn't give me time. Which was totally ok and understable. 

Anyway in one of our conversation where he was stressed about not getting a job, I remember giving him a pep talk, and he told me then that when he gets a job I'll be one of the first few people he'll tell. 

It's been around two months since we stopped talking and he texted me today that he got a hired! I'm also suprised that he remembered and texted me about his job. I'm so happy for him. In suprising turn off events in currently unemployed after leaving a toxic workspace and seeing him get a job, made me feel not so bad about my own unemployment. So to whoever is in the same boat. We got this! We'll get a good job that will make us happy."
happy,"I'm a 30yr old woman and I've never really played with Legos before. My husband is an avid Lego lover, both as a kid and as an adult, and has recently wanted to get back into building them. 

I know there have been some really cool sets to come out in the past couple of years (some look like flowers or little zen gardens or insects one might pin, etc) so when he got himself a set today I also looked. I found this darling little bonsai tree and he offered to get it for me so we could build together! 

We both put ours together tonight and it was so much fun! I didn't realize that the cherry blossoms were actually little pink frogs until I got to that section. My little bonsai is chilling with its adorable little pink frogs on my counter and I could not be more pleased!

And for anyone wondering, hubby got himself the Thanos glove and he is pleased as punch! 😊"
happy,You can do it too!!!
happy,Just wanted to share pictures from where I started and where I am. I’m so grateful to have friends and family that have helped along the way.
happy,"I just got the best news!!!

After months of waiting, many tests, background checks and a fun 4 hour long psych eval with even more tests involved…

I got offered a job as a County Detention Deputy!!!!

It’s almost double the yearly salary I have been getting for the last few years!

This is fantastic news!!!!"

"
happy,"I came out to my parents about being non binary (AFAB) when I was 16, I've known it since I was 15 and rn I'm 20. So it's been a long time and I'm quite sure of myself about who I am and how I feel.
A few years ago my mom kept telling me that it was a phase and my dad even told me that I was just following a trend that that if I ever did anything to make my body appear less feminine then he wonnt consider me his child anymore... Other than that everything was great in my life.

But now my parents are suddenly trying to accept me!
I have no idea what changed but today my mom came to my room to give me some of my dad's old clothes, we're going to attend a wedding soon so I needed good clothes for that, and she gave me my dad's old suit!
I was so happy that for the first time she didn't ask me to wear a dress, and my dad accepted to lend me his old clothes for a formal event without trying to convince me to wear something else first😁😁😁
And when I tried everything on my mom looked at me and I could see all the love in her eyes and she just said ''you're becoming a beautiful person''
I almost cried, I'm french so we have a very binary language and she used the word joli/jolie which means beautiful but it sounds the same way no matter if it's masculine or feminine (unlike beau/belle), and she said person and not young woman as she usually did

I'M SO HAPPY 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
They're both 50+ and they're actually trying to change how they acted and how they were raised (like considering anything LGBT+ just a young people trend) to accept me as me 🥰 I love them so much and I just want to share that joy with everyone and anyone right now 🥳❤️"
happy,"
Started a new job in February and became fast friends with Amanda. Her friendship means the world to me. Even though she is 18 years younger than me. We just love being friends. Yesterday we got our nails done and had dinner and drinks. 
I laughed so much my cheeks hurt. ☺️😊
We even got drinks that look like us 😂🤣"
happy,"(Just to preface this, it happened yesterday, and I wrote it yesterday, so it’s in present tense, but happened yesterday)

So I have a lot of very noticeable self harm scars on my legs. Especially my right thigh. They’re basically all over, and pretty close to my knees. If I wear shorts, they’re extremely visible. Today, it was 85 degrees, and I also am in track and field.

I was super super nervous about wearing shorts to school today, because it’d really be the first time anyone would have seen my scars, and I was just freaking out. The day had gone pretty good, 2 girls asked me what happened to my leg, I just said “it’s not important” and they left it at that.

Then, at the end of track practice, a guy a couple grades older than me comes up to me, and says “hey, amazing-flute-piano, are those scars?” As he gestures towards his own leg. Internally, I’m dying. Like I’m soooo nervous for what he’s about to say.

I just say “yea, they are”. Then he says “I think you’re so incredibly brave for wearing shorts. That takes a lot of courage.” And I just thanked him.

I also smiled. I did more than smile. I cried. I started crying from the sheer gratefulness and gratitude I felt. I started crying because I never expected those words to come out of anyone’s mouth, let alone another high schoolers. I started crying because that meant so much to me. It made me feel so happy. It truly did. It made me feel like I wasn’t alone, and that not everyone will judge me. It made me feel proud, and not ashamed.

Tomorrow, I have a class with him, and I’m going to make sure that I thank him again, because he deserves it. 🤍"
happy,"I forgot I had this account. I finally got it back so I'm very happy :D it took a lot of password guesses and stuff, I also had to figure out my old email 😅 that was a bit of a chore. However, it worked out in the end :)"
happy,I was able to buy the house mostly using money my mother left after she passed away.  And I think she'd be proud and happy knowing the hard work she put in while she was alive helped give me a new chance.  She always wanted me to live happy and now I am.
happy,"I'm 32, been struggling with depression and anxiety since I was about 13 or 14. Due to reasons, I never tried medication for either, before (even when I definitely should have). Basically, I was conditioned to think that my illnesses were not real and medication was just not an option. 

About a year and a half ago, I started meds for my depression, and they certainly help, but I've still been struggling with overwhelming, constant anxiety that has been truly ruining my life. I *finally* talked to my doctor about it, and she prescribed an additional medication. Within only 5 days, I have noticed a HUGE, incredible improvement. I feel like me, again. I can breathe again (literally, I've have constricted breathing for like a year). 

I want to cry, I'm so relieved and happy to feel like I have my life back, again. I wish I had done this years ago, but I've got it now and that's all that matters!"
happy,"I got the Sony WH-1000XM4’s and they’re so amazing. The sound quality is so nice and I can’t get over the noise cancellation feature. Everything is so quiet and I feel so much calmer. Noises put me on edge sometimes when I’m overwhelmed (often), so they have just helped a lot. :D"

happy,One of my closest friends went to NYC in an au pair exchange and I painted one of my favorite photos of us  with watercolor and then I gave it to her at the airport before she got on the plane! 💗 She loved btw and it's now on her bedside table in her bedroom at her host family house. 
happy,"I'll get my certification in the mail soon. I was so nervous as the desktop was loading to give me my grade. I'm just happy to be done and over with it all. Thank god. 🙏🏼 I can't wait to get it in the mail. 

Please pray for me (if you pray) because I have a 100question exam that I'll be taking on my own time this weekend for Lean Six Sigma / project management. 🤞🏼 It's a 2hr test, 100 questions. "
happy,"When I finally got up the courage to go to the dentist, I discovered that I needed an old crown replaced, 2 fillings, and, worst of all, 2 root canals. I am terrified of drilling and each time I had to go to an appointment over the past few months, I had to steel myself. However, this entire few years that I have gone without seeing a dentist, I knew that it was just a matter of time before I had a major problem, or even caused myself a serious health problem. It was like I had a shadow of worry always hanging over my shoulder, even in happy moments, and I knew the only way to dismiss it was to finally go to the dentist and let them fix every single problem.  

I had been saving up for a new car, so that money is all gone now, but I don’t need a new car the way I need the blissful peace of mind that comes with finally resolving a serious problem that has followed me for years.  

And actually, it ended up being not the worst case scenario. I didn’t lose a single tooth. I didn’t have to get any implants. If I do better at taking care of my teeth going forward, I hope I can keep all of them. And I hope I don’t ever have to do a root canal again. And my mouth feels so much better.  

edit to add: I just want to describe some things that happened during my first appointment. I was so terrified I was trembling violently. During the part where they were examining my teeth, with various sharp implements, every time it hurt so much, I would flinch violently. Tears began to stream from the corners of my eyes. Until finally the dentist said “Do you need a moment?” and I sat up and the tech fetched my water bottle from my backpack. All of this was in the FIRST appointment, and all they were trying to do was find what was wrong, and what needed to be fixed, and I was so afraid, and my injured teeth hurt SO much. It was, all of it, built upon old childhood trauma, drilling when I wasn’t really numb, an elderly dentist chasing me around the chair and then yelling at my mother not to bring me in again if I was too stupid to let him help me.   

Anyway. I somehow made it through. Perhaps that first appointment _was_ the worst. Worse even than the root canals. "
happy,"Growing up I was always in special education classes and have a real hard time learning. I was addicted to meth for 16 years and have been sober for 14. I started working at a treatment center in the kitchen, and never thought that I would ever have my own office able to help people struggling with substances. The thought of passing this test was so far-fetched. Anyway, on the 31st I passed my test and feel about 2 inches taller. And for somebody of my stature that’s a big deal lol I have been happy dancing all week. Now I have a career that I can provide for my 15-year-old son. Which I got full custody of when I was five years sober. Life is so good. If you’re struggling but doing the right thing, keep it up it pays off."
happy,"These are the things I've quit to be more happy:

Competetive gaming: Its just a bunch of pixels on my screen that has no real value and it also made me lose the fun for videogames over the years. 

Social media: I still use social media but less than before. It took me a long time of self discipline to do that and nowadays I have a screen time of 20 min at best. I also think that social media helped me with that as well because whenever I read comments all I read are either bot comments, brainrot opinions or unnecessary hateful stuff. This also made me realize if the time I put into watching internet content is worth it or not. I have the mindset of using the Internet only for research purposes for things I dont know about so I can learn new stuff.

Bad eating behavior: I used to heavily rely on vitamin pills because I would always refuse to eat certain things because a doctor on YouTube would tell me this is bad or that is bad etc. It really ruined me as a person but today I'm doing a bit better now. I feel more happy now that my body is receiving the natural vitamins which was craving for years.

Being home all the time: I always saw my home as a ""safe"" place where I always wanted to stay all the time. 

Its quite dangerous over time and it does get to you mentally. I wasnt afraid of going outside and I dont have social anxiety but I always felt comfy being home and not doing stuff outside. Nowadays I always try to go outside whenever I can unless Im out of energy. I even bought a professional camera JUST so I can have a reason to go outside and do some nice pictures of nature or other things that look nice.

Quitting all of these things made me more of a happy person and I appreciate life more. Im almost 22 and honestly... maybe I should've listened to my mom but my teenage self had other things in mind. 

Have a nice day everyone :D"
happy,"I have always worked construction and trades jobs my whole life but a few years ago I took a leap and decided to do something with my creative side. It has always been my dream to work in a creative field as I’ve always loved art and design. So I’ve been going to university for graphic design for the past two years online. I’ve been working meaningless part time jobs in retail and maintenance to pay my bills while going to school. 

A little while ago my friend gave me a tip that his company was hiring and it’s in the industry. Long story short I beat the other applicants and was hired!!! I am now a layout editor for a media company. I specialize in newspaper page layouts. For the first time in my life I’m actually making a living wage and can afford to live normally.

happy,"I'm an artist in NYC and the last several months have been brutally slow. After a lot of exhausting work, and serious anxiety about what they would say, not 1 but both people who reached out to me said they were going through with their purchases!!! I am soooooo happy and relieved!!! I'll be taking myself out to dinner tomorrow to celebrate 🥳 🎉  The first painting was called ""A Summer Daydream"" and the second was ""Health, Wealth, Prosperity."" Both acrylic on canvas and lots of love! Cheers to a great new year!! ✨️🥰✨️"

i finally feel happy and less anxious, im arguing with my dad less and things are looking up ! yay !!!! 😁 life is good and it DOES in fact get better"
happy,"I probably found a friend for life

We know eachother for 6 years, even though we didn't meet irl as he's to far from my city, we trust eachother more than anyone we have. He saved me from un-aliving myself multiple times and he didn't even know about it. Tonight we were just talking, he went into a topic of my mental health and then we both thanked eachother for helping ourselves. I'm glad he exists and if I didn't play that one league game I wouldn't be here right now.


Edit: Did I?

happy,"Ever since my divorce my life has been soooo much better! I had no idea how much he was dragging me down financially, physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

I’ve paid off all my credit cards and have finally started saving — saving! I’m at my goal weight and I look and feel amazing. I have a gorgeous apartment that I get to decorate however I want; and since my tax return was huge then I actually have the money to do it!

For the first time in my life I only have ONE job, and it’s remote! 

The weather is glorious, my dog is the best ever, I have great friends, my plants are thriving, I love spending time with myself, and I’m even drinking less! 

Thanks for listening Internet strangers, it always feel like too much to brag to friends and family when you’re feeling this good! "
happy,Definitely going to start buying these to give as gifts! It also smells absolutely lovely. :)
happy,"Now i don't live on this subreddit, however ima write a thing that kinda makes me smile right now

In my school we got a class called ""musical"", volentarily, where basically everyone that is in his last 2 grades helps performing a musical (11th grade \[second to last\] helps, 12th (last) on stage). My teacher is doing this job for 20 years already, so he knows what he has to do, and what will happen. HOWEVER we are his first premiere, the first one to perform the musical ""School Of Rock"" in our country (Germany).

We've began to practice a few weeks ago, we knew our singing parts more or less already, so it wasn't such a big deal. Now that we are on our final days it starts to hit us, that we will be standing for so many people, singing, shouting and dancing. And boy/girl you don't know how happy i am. It might be that i am going crazy again, but boyyy/guuuurlll i can't stop smiling, it's gonna be nexxt weeeeeeek :D

It's all fun, of course sometimes we don't agree with everything, but mostly we (I) have fun"

happy,"I just wanted to share it with somebody who can appreciate it. I am a young aspiring writer and I have never got actual recognition for it before. It's a small contest, but I am still incredibly overjoyed by it. It was a short story, but I mostly specialise in those anyway. It feels so awesome to have someone see my work and like it.
I'm not even excited about whatever my reward will be. I'm just happy someone read that little story and enjoyed it."
happy,"This is my life. I can't share this with anyone without coming off as boastful, but I just needed to put it into words. This is the story of my growth as a person through from being a kid to an adult through a year, from a single drunken realisation.

When I was a kid, I was, and still am, incredibly fortunate. I was born into a financially safe family with loving parents, a cool older brother. I was an athlete as a kid, smart, confident and socially liked. Kind, respectful, 'cool'. Mate's parents loved me, my friends thought I was the shit, everything was perfect. I got older, became a teenager. I had a big friend group, I was good with girls and good at the things I tried. I never tried in school and did well, and I started truly becoming a prick. I was so full of myself. I picked on anyone that was different to me to make my mates or girls laugh, I was crass and rude. I'd spend my life fucking around with my friends, not doing anything of value and arguing with people on the internet to get a rise out of them. I didn't appreciate my parents or my family, I'd show up late to important things and not bother going to things if I didn't absolutely have to. My mates started getting sick of me. My parents started getting sick of me. My brother started getting sick of me.

Then adulthood came. I was 18, I finished school with decent marks, got into a good degree at uni, and started completely letting everything go. For my entire life, everything had been done for me. I'd show up, do the bare minimum, and life started going downhill because of it. I got into a relationship with a girl and interjected myself in her life. I'd try and 'fix' things for her that didn't need fixing, and her resentment grew. She came from a rough house, wasn't mentally healthy and started taking it out on me, verbally and emotionally. My life caught up with me. I was turning in my assignments at the last possible moment, scrapping together the lowest amount of money possible to pay for alcohol, club tickets and petrol, I was putting up with emotional manipulation and hurtful insults from the girl I loved. I stopped going to the gym. I started smoking. I let myself go mentally and physically completely. I gained heaps of weight, picked up terrible habits with everything you can think of. I embraced the full on 'loser' lifestyle. I leeched off my family and made nothing of myself. Me and my ex broke up in a bad way, and I put up with the harassment for months afterwards.

I was a 'yeah I'll get around to it' type of person. I was gonna get my shit together, I was gonna get back to the gym, I was gonna work on myself EVENTUALLY. I was gonna get a tattoo, I was gonna finish uni, I was gonna get a 'real' job. Every day I'd lie to my friends, my family, but most importantly, myself. I'd lie that I was going to get things back on track and start living, but it never happened. I never started anything. I had my hand in a thousand things and the moment I wasn't immediately gratified with a reward, I quit. I was gonna make more friends and go travelling! I was going to get a high paying job with absolutely zero effort! I was so stuck in the mindset of everything being easy and done for me, that I just expected things to work out for me.

At the start of last year, I was a fraction of the human I am now. To cope with how 'hard' life was, I did everything dumb you can think of. I was a 20 year old bloke, depressed, selfish, leeching loser. All I did was party, chat up girls, eat like shit, drink too many beers and smoke too much bud, and ALWAYS fuck off any real work and ambition for a good night with my mates. I had zero self-control, zero idea, zero moderation and idea of where I was going and what I was capable of. No life skills. For Christ's sake, I could barely do my own laundry. My Mum had taken care of almost every tiny aspect of my life and I'd never even appreciated her for it. I remember going to my ex's and barely knowing how to wash dishes because I was that useless in any real life skill. Everything was done for me.

Then things got rough. My dad's heart essentially gave out, my brother who had always been a stalwart, mature and driven bloke had a full blown mental health crisis due to some physical health issues, and my family collapsed. Dad was off work and Mum was taking care of him, my brother was bedridden and lower than any low I'd seen him overcome before. And there I was; sat in my room, taking my life for granted. I was playing games into the late hours, never doing my uni course work and working a casual, extremely low-hour and low paying job, not because I was busy, but because I was lazy and didn't want to face any real work. I'd rather just sit in my room and watch every youtube video and pump as many hours into games as I could, then the weekend would come and I'd be drunk/high for the entirety of it and make stupid self destructive choices. Never saved any money or did anything for anyone farther than what I had to do to consider myself a good person. I was seeing a girl I had no romantic interest in because I was bored, taking her kindness for granted. Absolute rock bottom. My mental illness was out the wazoo. Shit was absolutely brutal and was truly my lowest low.

Then, one day, I was over at a mate's and we were playing poker. I had a smoke in my mouth and 8 or 9 empty beer bottles next to my chair and a fresh one in my hand, hair greasy and out of sorts, basically had my pyjamas on, totally mashed. I looked over at a mate to make a stupid joke and caught a look at myself in the mirror. I was overweight, my skin was a mess, I was borderline unwashed and I absolutely HATED it. I realised in a fraction of a second that all the anger and hurt I was balling up in my stomach wasn't directed to anyone else. It wasn't the people who'd put me down, it wasn't my ex, it wasn't my loving family who I perceived as 'overbearing and annoying', it was me. I'd come from a life of such opportunity and I'd squandered all of it. My life was in shambles and it was MY fault. No one put a drink in my hand or a smoke in my mouth, no one put a gun to my head and stopped me studying and working on myself. I'd done it myself. I was a total dick to everyone around me, even catching the insult to my friend in my throat that wasn't funny in the slightest; just a knee jerk reaction to something he'd said. I was immature in every sense of the word, and I was completely wasting myself, my opportunities and my life.

In that moment, I was truly, truly disgusted with myself. I loathed the life I'd wasted, and then came to another instant realisation. That didn't have to continue. I didn't have to hate myself anymore. I'm young, there was still time to put things in the right place and get it done. I didn't have to keep up with my ex's instagram anymore, I didn't have to drink myself to death to have a good time. I didn't have to spend all of my free time outside of partying playing games and being bored. There was new things to try; a whole life yet lived.

Over the next month, I made changes. I put my study on hold, which was an incredibly hard thing to do. For the first time truly in my selfish life, I sacrificed my own movement forward to take care of the people around me. I got out there, picked up another job. I started trying. I started, very slowly, turning myself back into someone I once was, someone a young me could be proud of. Someone my parents could be proud of. Someone I could be proud of. I stopped drinking for an entire month, which I hadn't done since I'd turned 18. I completely put down the bong. I booked myself into a therapist and paid for it myself, not trying to wrangle money out of my parents to put money into self growth that would go to waste. I wrote down a list of my goals. I signed back up to the gym. I stopped chasing late nights and cheap relationships.

I slipped up at times. Made dumb decisions, I hurt people. But I stopped beating myself up for my own mistakes and trying to blame circumstance or other people. I started holding myself accountable. I started showing regret and appreciation a lot more, I stopped saying 'I'll get around to it'. I started doing.

I started taking care of my dad physically, my brother mentally and giving my Mum a break. I'd clean the house and do the shopping so she could come home from work and just be with my old man. I went outside and learned to properly mow, learned how to hedge, how to weed and lay gravel. I fixed stuff in our house by myself with no direction except for google, I learned how to be financially intelligent, I learned true independence from my family for the first time. I learned that I could laugh louder and bring smile to peoples faces, I learned that within me was the ability to do anything I could put my mind to. I learned that part of my happiness came from spreading joy to those around me and making people smile. I learned to put down the lying, scummy, self loathing part of myself again. The pessimist. I started appreciating the sun more, I started spending more time just helping! I started spending real time with my brother. We became mates again. I started coaching him through his breakdowns and holding him through his panic attacks. I started kissing my mum on the cheek again and bringing my parents a coffee in bed. I started laughing with my friends instead of at them. I started showing pride in my own actions, pride in other's actions. I complimented people's clothes and their laughs, shaking more hands, working harder. I started catching up on all the uni work I'd missed and getting up earlier. I started going for runs. I starting putting greenery on my plate. I started washing up the dishes more, watching movies with my dad when he was awake, or sitting with him while he was reading. I started hanging out with my Mum and treating her to coffee and lunch, getting her out of the house. I started driving my friends around while they drank and I just smiled and laughed and got on the AUX for them. I started writing music and stories again. I put more effort into DnD characters, I stopped being embarrassed about stupid things. I started SMILING. Really, actually, SMILING.

I was going out, and I was partying, but I was drinking within my wallet and I wasn't so miserable when I was mashed. I started dancing and walking girl's to their front doors instead of just dropping them off. I started connecting with the kids at work and I started babysitting my cousins. I went over to my grandparent's house and fixed their technology, spending time with them. I stopped trying to what I considered cool and just starting doing fun shit. I tried bouldering. I tried surfing. I tried playing club footy again. I started hanging out with new people, people completely different to me. I started learning. I started to feel passion for things again. I started training muay thai because I'd always said I would.

I started DOING.

Now, here I am, emotional late at night and just so fucking HAPPY. I'm single and so content with my life and so busy that I have no interest in being in a relationship, I am overwhelmed with pure joy and so truly happy with who I am. I've lost weight. I don't smoke or vape anymore. I'm excited to wake up and go to work and come home and give my mum a hug and hang out with her while she cooks dinner. My dad's back to almost full strength and he's his old happy self, my brother is medicated and learning to become himself again. I spend less time in my room. I spend less time existing and more time living. Me and my friends are even actually going travelling next year, because I'll be graduating! We're doing a roadtrip across America and I'm so excited. I'm going to have so much fun and meet so many new people. Then I'm gonna come home, continue the life I'll be putting on hold temporarily. I'm gonna get a decent job and do my best. 

There will be pitfalls, I'm going to have bad days and meet bad people, have bad experiences but I'm stronger now than I ever was before. I can cook for myself. I can clean for myself. I help out around the house. I show my love to people. I write my feelings down and create stories that I share with my friends. I found my passion for being alive again. I've become a rock for someone very close to me that I work with every day to get her life back on track.

Don't get me wrong, I haven't fixed everything in a year. I still struggle with staying ontop of my newfound responsibilities and sometimes I'm lazy and sometimes I make dumb decisions, but I am leaps and bounds ahead of where I was. I am always trying to improve, and I can only go up from here.

One day, I'm going to be even happier than I am now. I'm gonna have a wife and kids that I can support through anything they go through, and I'm going to be a fuckin' great dad and dude in general. God fucking damn. I am absolutely ecstatic to be alive.

Life's good in the sunshine.

I had someone end up DMing me about this post talking about their own alcohol and nicotine intake and I just wanted to throw this on the end; there's nothing wrong with partying and having fun. I still go out and get pissed and what not, but the way I was doing it at the start of last year was simply as a coping mechanism. I was completely out of moderation and completely out of my head, and I was way overdoing it. There's nothing lame about getting drunk and having a good time, as long as you're doing so healthily and being safe! Everything in moderation."
happy,"And I just...

It feels so good.

Another friend, let's call her M, became super super super close with me over the past 2 months.

Anyway, tonight, my oldest friend (I've known her for like 26 years; she was my first girlfriend at like 13 years old), let's call her A, said she was really jealous about M and I was like why? And she told me she was super possessive of me.

I've always had a thing for A (except while I was in relationships) and I... guess all the signs were there. I mean... the last time we hung out she was grinding her butt all over my leg for like 20 minutes straight while I was chatting with friends at a house party. She also always makes sure to tell me she loves me before we get off the phone and she's not even remotely an affectionate woman.

I cant believe how oblivious I was.. Autism i guess haha

3 months ago I thought I was going to be alone forever. And now this on top of everything else.

Fuck 😊

I'm so happy."
happy,"Throughout my life I have dealt with a series of health problems and that caused me to be very lethargic. Been to hospital and so on many times. Mainly stuff with my ovaries, kidneys, and liver.  

One thing that made me upset a bit was when I was 17 and attempted to donate blood, but was just not able to due to my condition and problems in general.

Today after dealing with going to the doctors pretty much once a month last year I was finally eligible to donate and so I signed up and did so. 

Happened only a few hours ago and I feel great! Before when I used to get blood drawn for example for medical reasons I would get very nauseous and faint just due to how my health was. Feels strange not feeling that way despite the donation being more blood."
happy,My derpy boy also loves me unconditionally and if he loves me I can love myself like my cat loves me.
happy,"ljust need to let this out to some one but I'm finally happy in a relationship, my last one was exhausting and it was to the point that my new S/0 was confused why was so happy when she came into the store with me. I also almost cried when the first time I was at work and she stayed at my place she had cleaned the entire place just cuz, no one has ever done that and it ment so much to me,It just feels like such a great weight off my shoulders and made me feel something I've never felt before. I can't wait to take her on her first vacay in Sept to show how much she means to me and to spend time with he in Disney. 

Also wanted to let people know that love is out there, if this woman can love a 23 year old autistic guy with 10k in Legos, then there is hope for everyone out there."
happy,First week of college my girlfriend broke up with me because she wanted to hookup with a guy she met in class after begging me to come to college with her and being in a relationship with her for a year she successfully hooked up with him and kept me on the ropes for 7 whole months and I developed a pill addiction and asked her for help with it but she didn’t care a month ago I ended things with her it was then she realized she threw me away and took me for granted for that long and wants me back but I know after what she did to me I can’t go back it’s been a month now and I’m very happy I’m talking to a new lady rn and things are going good but why do I feel guilty ending things with her ?
happy,"everyday can be a chance to start over is the what i think about each day i wake up and get out of bed. i want to hear your story and what you either think, or do to stay happy and not let bad thoughts ruin the start of your day!"
happy,"I didn’t even interview, she said she knew she wanted to hire me for the position which shocked me as it was not the position I originally applied for. I know I won’t get paid right away but it’s something my landlord (hopefully) will work with. I haven’t had any money coming into this home for the last 3 months and to start working in a field I have been wanting to be in, brings tears to my eyes. 

I hope this is long enough and fleshed out more so it won’t get flagged. I NEVER post things that are private but with this win I feel like maybe I should start sharing with the world a bit more. Thank you for taking the time to read this message. "
happy,"Hey All - Just wanted to tell someone other than since I don’t really have any friends. 

Got the promotion at work I’ve been working towards for the last 11 months. Over 125 interviews (internal postings) and I got selected. Beat out very capable individuals, some with 5-7 years of seniority. 

Pretty damn happy. Giving my all each and every day, without exception, finally paid off for me, for once. 
"
happy,"I’m feeling really proud of myself, and I’m super appreciative of all of the people that gave me feedback and help along the way. Wanted to share this feeling with everyone!!"
happy,"I was infantry, and I used to feel a certain amount a guilt having never killed.  Think of it as survivors guilt in a way, of others have to carry that burden what makes me so special?  But the older I get, the more I’m just all around glad and relieved.  We all think we will be fine when we join, but as you mature you realize there’s no telling how you’ll react.  I can finally, at least for today, say I’m perfectly fine having never been in that situation.  Some may look down on this, but kiss my ass after Taco Bell "
happy,"I got the Sony WH-1000XM4’s and they’re so amazing. The sound quality is so nice and I can’t get over the noise cancellation feature. Everything is so quiet and I feel so much calmer. Noises put me on edge sometimes when I’m overwhelmed (often), so they have just helped a lot. :D"
happy,I work retail. I don't remember the last time I was called kind.
happy,"Hit my lowest point ever a few months ago. Went out to the train tracks to end it all, not gonna lie. The cause was the ending of a five year relationship, naively thinking that they were the 'one' and all that junk. 

What saved me, and is keeping me going, is... the various friends I made along my healing journey (seriously, both new and old friends really stepped up to help), discovering awesome new hobbies (photography, boxing, fishing, etc), rediscovering the joy in old hobbies (cycling, foraging, language learning, etc), learning to love myself, helping others (got stuck focusing all my love on one person), becoming more involved in my community, and just letting go of my frustrations and anxieties and just living in the moment! 

And... the cherry on top is that I ended up meeting this pretty awesome friend who I'm, honestly, relating to and vibing with. Life is like ""hey, you're doing great with self love and healing, here's your reward: a friend who is almost identical to you, enjoy!"" Hahahaha so awesome! 

Looking forward to being done with university next year and being able to live a happy and fulfilling life :) and so many other dreams and goals to look forward to!"
happy,"* hang out with people you love. go out, get drunk, have fun. everything in moderation hehe
* touch people. hugs, touches, pets, holding hands, squeezes, cuddles... EVERYTHING
* talk to people. open up. it's okay to allow yourself to be held by the people you want to be cared by. *it's okay to have the selfish desire to be burdensome*. it is OKAY! keep moving. never stay in one place too long (small and large scale). *comfort is the foil of growth.*
* exercise. even if you don't feel like going, just do 15 minutes. the rest will come. and I KNOW you always feel better after moving. whether it be a walk after dinner, a gym run, or even a a simple stretch outside. 
* always push yourself. no matter how hard it seems, you can always go further. one extra lap, minute, or rep... just that extra breath of effort will push you boundlessly. you will realize you can overcome the goals you set for yourself, which slowly seep into the rest of your life. 
* correct negative thoughts gently. when you feel hateful, reflect on your own thoughts. why are you being mean? your inner thoughts heavily influence your perspective on the outer world. humans are creatures of projection, so PLEASE be kind to yourself and others.
* eat breakfast. even if you don't think you want to. a coffee, a fruit, or a slice of bread. I promise that extra boost of energy is worth it. 
* talk to people that make you happy. keep the company of people who uplift you. keep those who support you, purge the ones who denounce you. *may the bridges you burn light the way!* 
* talk less, act more. for me, actions have always spoken louder than words. making less excuses and just doing things will help propel your plot. 
* MUSIC. listen to it, play it, learn it, make it, worship it. make playlists, sing songs, listen with people. it's the best thing to boost you up and feel understood when no one else understands. (the best part about music is there's so freaking much of it you can't possibly find something you don't like)
* question your perspective to the world. think of the external and internal causes that lead you to your beliefs. learn to question EVERYTHING, but keep a grounding foot on your intuition as well.
* don't overthink. if you're self conscious about it, they probably are too. no one is focusing on your faults. you are your biggest critic! 
* you get out what you put out and that's that!

***\* DISCLAIMER: \****

this is the unsolicited advice of a (highly opinionated) 22F yr old onliner, so take everything with a grain of salt. this just happens to be a helpful guide i keep in my notes app and wanted to share. 

on paper, i have no impressive concrete accomplishments in my life. i am a classic instance of a burnt-out-gifted-kid turned college drop out. so, if you would like to tell me i am living my life wrong, go ahead. 

i am quite content. 

i have spent a lot of  time trying to find that sense of normalcy we've all been aching for since graduating high school. it felt like i would never experience that grandiose feeling of truly ""living in the moment"" and ""seeing in color"" again.  i wished the world would pause for me just once. just to allow me to relive a core memory from my childhood again. but alas, that nostalgic relief never comes... 

because truly, life goes on, and it never stops. 

to some, it might sound harsh, but i interpret it as a comfort saying. accepting that ""it is what it is"" but ""what ***will*** be, is in my hands"", is the most important takeaway. 

ultimately, there is no ""cure"" or solution to find happiness. it comes and goes, wanes and rises, just as the moon and the sun! if you remember the world always has balance, whether it be spiritually, mentally, or physically, you begin to understand that 

spread kindness and patience, or don't. it is up to you do as you please! just remember to challenge yourself always, and truly focus with intention.

happy,"I’ve been overweight for my entire life, and finally started trying to lose weight in a sustainable way back in December. As of this morning, I have lost 15 pounds! 

I have had trichotillomania (compulsive hair pulling, related to OCD and anxiety) for fifteen years. As of this morning, I have gone THREE DAYS without pulling! 

I’m a high school teacher, and this morning (after a pretty tough year), I found out that I get to teach my dream class next year!

I don’t have a lot of people to tell, but it was a really good day :) "

happy,We had a long and semi mild winter but with the freezes and thaws it's taken my garden to bloom any flowers. These daffodils are usually also eaten or picked by my children so this has been so nice to enjoy their beautiful blooms.
happy,"A close encounter of the saintly kind…

…At the grocery store with my daughter. She’s little, so tends to have the “Please, buy me everything!” anytime we’re in the store. Most of the time she’s fine with a “Not today, sweetie.” but today, she was in her feels because ALLLLLLLL of the day-after Valentine’s Day items were smack dab in front of the door when we walked in. She wanted a balloon. Mommy said “Not today, sweetie.” and today, that “not today” didn’t go over very well. She proceeded to be very pouty. Meh, it happens. 

Well, we’re in an aisle looking for artichoke hearts and there stood a kindly, bespectacled, affable looking gentleman. I asked his pardon as we passed. We started making small talk after he tried to engage my daughter and she made it very clear that she wanted a balloon and wasn’t allowed to have one. He laughed and looked at me chuckling. “It doesn’t get easier as they get older!” to which I replied “She’s six… pray for me!” 

The kindly gentleman (before we learned his name) knelt down and said to my daughter “You know… balloons are wonderful, but they are often the best when they’re surprises, so maybe you can look forward to getting one when you least expect it.” This seemed to go over well with my daughter. 

The kindly gentleman (Mr. Myles, I came to know) and I continued chatting about kids, life, and random musings, eventually parting with a genuine sense of happiness over the entire interaction. He proceeded to the front of the store and my daughter and I continued our shopping. 

A few moments later, he found us at the back of the store with a heart shaped balloon. With the biggest smile ever, he handed it to my daughter and said “See? Isn’t it so much better when it’s a surprise?” I was dumbfounded, more tickled pink than I’d been in a while and said “You’re an absolute angel! No wait- a Saint! Thank you Saint Myles!” 

Random acts of kindness are the best. In a world full of curmudgeonly behavior- be like Myles."
happy,"There wasn't anything special about it really. I just got back from helping my partner move a 9 hour drive away to school. I was driving back feeling very lonely, thinking about a lot of things, life in general. Called various family members and caught up with them. I finally made it home, got settled and took inventory of the food situation. Lots of ancient leftovers in the fridge. I made the ground turkey into taco meat, got the standard fixings together on the tortillas...

My God it was magical. Sometimes you feel like you need a good cry but then you have a good taco and everything is okay and you realize you don't need to cry. The universe put you right where you belong. You are strong. Things are pretty damn good and you get to live a very nice life.

I hope you all have a great night!

happy,I have schizophrenia. I was never happy until I had kids. My kid did a play and I thought her role was so cool. They did game of thrones with Disney princess. Called games of tiaras she was snow white mother of dragons every one died and she got the throne. I was so happy. My life suck at her age my got beat up everyday.my sister wanted to be a only child. My uncle beat my aunt my other uncle beat his kids. My sister was raped. My dad held me and family hostage at gun point. I doing better. 
happy,Today I found out that I passed my Calc II exam with an 88%! I’m happy that I got that high of a score!
happy,"Things I saw the other morning on the way to work that made me genuinely feel happy and exclaim loudly (like, actually out loud) with joy :

🐾 Walking across the carpark saw a man walking his tiny dachsund puppy, he stepped off the curb but had to stop and look back cos the puppy had sat down on the edge of the curb. So the guy went back and picked him up and put him on the road and then the puppy walked after him with a big waggy tail.

The step off the curb was too high!! 🥹

🎈3 hot air balloons coming into land nearby. I saw about 5 in the sky but there were 3 landing in a park along the trainline. They're huge! I've never seen that before!! It was very exciting for me!!

Kinda made my day. No photos, but it all happened. Just wanted to share my feelings of joy. 😊

Have a good day!!!"
happy,"I’m a friendly person so I know or recognize a lot of folks in person, but I am dogshit at recalling names. 

She said hello to me first and I said, “hey (redacted)!” and we had a nice chat about living here. Sounds like the last person to live in my place was really neat, so I have some cool shoes to fill! 

Hooray for small steps in self improvement and mundane conversations!"
happy,"Told myself on Halloween night of 2022 it was time for a change. 12/1/2022 318 lbs, 5/28/2023 285 lbs, 5/28/2024 163 lbs."
happy,That's all.
happy,"So, I’m 21 and have gone through a lot of hardship over the last few years. This has made me change my general plan for life a couple of times. But, after switching my major a few times, I decided I want to get a BS in IT. When I’m done with school, I want to move to Las Vegas. I was born in Las Vegas and lived there for the first 10 years of my life. Besides, IT does much better in Vegas than the state I live in. 

I also figured out, after soul searching the last month, that I really am trans (I had a period where I questioned if transitioning was the right choice for me and I figured out it was and I want to continue it!), I don’t want kids, I’m a stoner, and I’d be content being single. However, if someone comes along that’s fine too. I’m very eccentric (very neurodivergent and crazy life), so if I’m gonna find someone romantically, they’re gonna be in a place like Las Vegas. Basically, what I thought I wanted in life is very different then what I “wanted” in life at 19. I put quotations as I used to think, “I should live this way” instead of thinking of what I wanted.  

I fell into a deep depression after a break up around thanksgiving as I questioned what my true purpose in life was. I asked, “In spite of all of my challenges (like my 4 diagnosed mental illnesses which are all severe), why do I choose to continue to live?” Realizing all of this tonight was like answering that question which has been plaguing me for a while now. 

I’m much more happy and content with this plan. I hope I end up happy with it and the ways reality differs from my plan."
happy,"I'm solo traveling at the moment and I've had the realisation that I'm a completely different person than I was when I was younger (I'm 32 now). I remember back then I was so insecure and I dealt with crippling anxiety. I was so self aware and ashamed of myself that I had to mentally prepare myself to do grocery shopping because I was so afraid that people would judge me. I've never been conventionally attractive, but back then I was convinced I I was absolutely hideous and I didn't deserve good things. I feel so sorry for my younger self. Now I don't give a crap about what people think of me, I've accepted myself for who I am and find beauty in small things. Sometimes I still struggle with my appearance, but not in the self destructive way as I did ten years ago.I try to always be kind to myself and treat myself how I treat good friends. At the moment I'm doing whatever I want whenever I want, all the choices I make, I make for me. It is so freeing. I feel so much love for myself, ny life, my friends and family, my work.
God I love solo traveling."
happy,"My mom, who is literally one of the most thoughtful and kindest people I've ever and probably will ever meet, owns a storage place where she keeps all of her things that she sells. Sometimes, if she knows the person and knows they're struggling, she will give them things for super cheap. Like one time she sold someone she knew was struggling two nice brand new thick comforters for 4 dollars. She's very well known in the area for this and sometimes people will come and knock on her door just to give her stuff that they don't want, just because they know she'll take it and do good with it.

I always had a little pink mini frigidaire that I kept some of my beauty products in and I loved it dearly, but a few months back it stopped working. I never made a big deal out of it but my mom knew of it. Well, she kept it in mind apparently when today she came to me and gave me a practically brand new, perfectly working, mini black frigidaire that one of her friends didn't want anymore. Just because.

My mom is always reminding me that I can have anything that I want in her storage, she even insists on it when I tell her that I want to pay her. She will shout at me and say ""No! Take it! I don't want your money!"" I'm really grateful to her because I'm surrounded by really beautiful things (both vintage and non vintage) because she lets me have anything I want. I'll just look at something for two seconds too long and she'll ask ""You like it? You want it??"" It's funny really.

When she gave me the frigidaire I told her just how grateful I was and that I felt really lucky to have a mom like her. She said to me that I reminded her of herself at my age and that she once said the same words to her mom, who also owned a storage full of stuff that she would sell. Her mom (my grandma) was the same way and gave her whatever she wanted for free. It's no wonder I was surrounded by very pretty, sometimes downright luxurious looking things growing up too!

I know it's a bit superficial, it's not the only reason I am grateful to my mom, but it's just how thoughtful it was. It made me really happy. I'm glad to have a teensy fridge again too."
happy,"My washroom needed a good renovation for yearrrsss. Luckily, my dad does renovations for a living. With the help of our really friendly neighbour, they decided to take ln my washroom as their next project. I’m so happy a grateful for how it came out !!! :,DDD"
happy,"Are they enough?

I moved away from family and friends to another state over 1000 miles away. It’s just my husband, two dogs and me. I work from home. I’m 52 years old and it’s hard to make friends at this age. Is it wrong that I feel content and dare I say happy with the limited companionship? Social media tells me I should have friends to hang out with on a weekly basis. 

I like hanging out at home with my pups and husband. I read and garden. We have fires and cocktails. 

Am I missing out? Should I be trying harder? I do go back “home” twice a year to see family and one or two friends."
happy,"Pretty rainy today but that ain't stopping me! Walked the same distance as yesterday but I'll try another mile in a week or so! I appreciate the support of making this a daily thing and i also appreciate all of you who have ""joined"" me in my walking! Love y'all and I'll see you tomorrow!"
happy," I am so happy. Today I was able to get my own room after having been homeless for a few months. Lost my job and previous home and this last two years have been rough, but definitely back on track now. What a blessing!

 Edit: Can't really believe this got so much attention. Your messages feel amazing to me and I would love to post more of it as I save up and can start upgrading some things and making the room more 'mine'.

Much love to everyone!"
happy,"We are both in our second year of high school and she sent me this

It bloomed I'm so happy ☺️"
happy,Definitely going to start buying these to give as gifts! It also smells absolutely lovely. :)
happy,"
I've been in a really good mood lately. 

I just had a woman hit on me for the first time ever the other day. I was super nervous, but it left me feeling amazing.

And recently I've somehow (through no real effort on my part) managed to become surrounded by very thoughtful, kind, and genuine people.

I've felt more at ease with my life in general.

It almost feels like my world turned around on it's own, and it brought a lot of joy into my life."
happy,"I (M25) remember deploying to the Middle East and staying up until 2-3am in the middle of the desert sleeping on a litter (the medical kind) watching the Matthew Stafford led Lions beat the Matt Ryan led Atlanta Falcons. I was also there when we traded for Jared Goff. My Marines (I was their corpsman “medic”) were from Southern California so I got a lot of grief, but nothing could tear me apart from my home team.

Years later, I remember my girlfriend breaking up with me. I got drunk and sad while I watched the Jared Goff led Lions beat the Matthew Stafford led Rams, winning their first playoff game for the first time in 32 years.

It sounds dumb how much a sports team could effect your mental health. But fuck man, I needed that shit so fuckin badly both times. I often think about the happiness that team gave me when I was at my lowest, shit gets me every time. 

I lived all across the country and had plenty of people just chirp in my ear about how I should just give up being a Lions fan and just join their fan base and I never did. There’s something special about facing adversity or how ____ and ____ isn’t good enough and coming back on the other side better, showing them they were wrong. I think we can all relate to that in some level. You can say it’s dumb, it is a little… but that made me happy and that’s all I need.

"
happy,"edit: Wow, I'm so happy with all the amazing comments! You're making my day even more!

The song is called Restart (it's about erasing it all and starting from scratch). Here's the [YT link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3-dLzHz4jU)! (I'll remove the link if it's not allowed, mods please just let me know!)

edit 2: And to top if all, GOLD? What's happening today? Thank you SO MUCH!

edit 3: I'm reading all of your messages and it really makes this day special! Now I understand why this sub is called r/happy!"
happy,I have been wanting to start a landscaping business for awhile now. The weather just started to turn the corner so I am going to go door to door after work today to see if I can get a little lawn care route going! I'm so exci
happy,"She told me, ""I know what it's like to not be able to leave home, so now you can."""
happy,"Today is the day my life will change FOREVER!!!!

Even as a welder, the most I have ever made doing back breaking work was $20.60 an hour. I currently make $18.22 an hour as a lead IT processing technician. Since 2021, I have been going to school for an A.A.S in multimedia/web development. I joined this company in 2022 and worked up to a lead IT processing technician. And today I was just offered a software developer job for $50,000 a year.

I wont lie, yes, I worked INCREDIBLY hard. I am in the honors society as the VP of communications and public relations for our school chapter. I have maintained a 4.0 GPA (I am graduating in May, I have 2 classes left that I am currently taking) and am so close to graduating with highest honors in my community college. I won an award last year in our state that only 55 students out of 200,000+ community college students called the All-State Academic Team and won a scholarship for Women in STEM. I am a very ambitious and have strived so much through this

BUT, I would have not had this job opportunity if I didn't have luck on my side. Working at this company, I found out they have a software developer team, and did my best to network with them and the adjacent IT team since I started. I had people who I made friends with who spoke my name when the software developer team asked about possible internal candidates. Just like it was luck for them that they actually had an internal employee who lives close enough to their facility who just happens to be going to school for web development, I just so happen to be lucky to work at a place where I could even move up like this.

There were 192 candidates, some of them being other internal employees. And I got it. me. I can't believe this.

I WANT TO CELEBRATE AND SCREAM TO THE ROOFTOPS"
happy,I think I'm off to good start today
happy,"Apparently one night while I was extremely tired, I told him I really wanted a tiny spoon to eat with. He remembered and gave them to me a few days ago. Will forever use these things <3"
happy,"Husband had to work in Kinross, but stayed in St Ignace. Someday we'll make it up to Mackinac in the Summer, but for now I can have the fudge! The kids each got chocolate, I have Turtle, Sea salt and caramel, and chocolate peanut butter."
happy,"Even tho it’s quite embarrassing I wanted to share this. This is Caesar my poodle puppy who is ready to greet me early every morning. This means I have to get up and out to walk him first thing, something that I COULD NOT and WOULD NOT ever do before I had him because of my agoraphobia. He has given me more independence and has made me progress so much faster. He even helps with my panic attacks. But most importantly I love him and he makes me happy!"
happy,Happy family. 🙂
happy,"I've got some body image issues, depression, and all the other things we all deal with and when I'm feeling low I find post matching my mood and give the positive advice I wish someone would lay down on me, hoping it helps.

Today I responded to one and they dm'd me back and said thanks and even went through a couple of my old post and gave me some advice...how great.

Have a great day everyone, spread the love!"
happy,Just comment if you want one!<3

happy,This is my girlfriend of 7 years and both of our kids 5 year old girl and 3 year old boy. We both worked a long day but wanted to treat our kids to some fun at the park before the sun went down and go to Dairy Queen to end the night! We have been through some hard times but no matter what the light always will shine the next day and I have to keep my light shining!!!
happy,"Melissa? Are you there?

sadly i did not get the year down, was a bit over 2 decades late! but still this makes me very happy"
happy,"Been talking to this girl for a actually not that long just two or thre months, has not been the best start but currently it's been working really well actually. got to hang out and yeah she's starting to text me on her own whenever we didn't text much throughout the day, asking me how my day has been. Seems stupid but it really means alot to me because i have had a really  exhausting  time with relationships and had little to no female friends and never talking to anyone or socializing for days and feeling left alone and it's been a while since my last relationship that was more than just sleeping together. I mean intimicay doesn't do much for me if i don't feel emotionally connected. Nothing made me happier recently than when she texts me and asks how my day was or when we just talk about Mutual interests and shit. Life has been really good recently."

happy,"Grew up in a small poor town in rural midwest. First of my family to go to college. I did two years of community college first while working at the mall and lived with parents, then I transferred to University and I only needed a loan for my final semester. That was in 2012. Not gonna lie, I was pretty much couch surfing/homeless til 2014 where I decided to learn programming (my major in college was history, what a waste of time).

Got my big break in 2015, but still living on the edge and needed roommates until 2019. In 2022 I joined a tech startup which I am still working at. I have zero debt outside of a mortgage (got a house at 3% in 2022 whew!), and have savings of a bit over $500k thanks to some smart investing. I got married in 2019 and have a daughter, and life is pretty good as I get to work from home and my wife doesn't have to work. My hours are flexible at work as well as long as I get my tasks done, that's all they care about. No set hours.

After expenses we have about $3k left over every month to invest or do something fun with.

I am pretty happy. Hopefully it lasts."
happy,"and also wanted to ask the you, the users of internet if I am the only one who thinks that she looks like soe kind of a fairy."
happy,"I think I’ve done really well. I’ve been with my beautiful wife for 30 years, my two children are loved, well adjusted, educated and emotionally whole. I am financially stable, in love, calm and have the family of my dreams. I have burnt a lot of bridges removing myself from narcissistic parents and siblings, doing everything I can to break the cycle of toxicity and destruction. Both my wife and I are true survivors and are each other’s best friends."
happy,"Backstory: my grandfather played for Ike & Tina Turner in the 60’s. He “retired” from playing about 12 years ago, but tonight I convinced him to play one last time to end 2023. 
The sax he’s playing is a Buescher Aristocrat built in 1949 that was purchased for him by his father. He gifted me the saxophone for my 26th birthday & I start lessons next week. 
I’m infinitely proud of him & have some big shoes to fill. Happy New Year! 🎉"
happy,"My boyfriend lives on the other side of the world, so we only get to see each other a handful of times each year. I arrived last night after a very long day of driving, flying, and layovers.

This is my second time seeing him in 2024, and we’ll get 2-3 more visits if we’re lucky.

Before I left, I googled concerts in the area, and my favorite band is playing nearby! I found out about the show completely by chance, and I’m so excited!

Currently sitting on his couch, crocheting a blanket for him, and he’ll be home in about 30 minutes (:

So grateful I get to see my favorite band live with my favorite person!!! Happy Thursday everyone"
happy,Granted I only got an A with two extra credit points (otherwise it would be a very high B) but no matter what I am extremely happy that I passed my Calc II exam. Integration techniques was a very fun section! 
happy,I’m so happy to see how far he has come and to watch him get healthy!
happy,My husband is on the path to the airlines which means we get to spend lots of Sunday afternoons flying around to get hours. Sedona is always spectacular 
happy,So I wanted to share that something rly good happened to me in my career/job today and I usually share these things with my gf of 5 years but we recently broke up and I have no one to share the happiness im feeling right now so I thought I'd just post it here :) 
happy,"I went to bed sad and preoccupied, I woke up groggy and then... 

Then I went to see my freshly repoted baby tomatoes, some of them grew a third cute leaf when I thought I fucked it all up ! New leaves on my plants (I'm a young plant parent, 20 plants besides the vegetables) give me hope, it's like starting anew, being reborn... 

What is the thing that made You smile today?"
happy,"It was just a passing comment during a phone call. To be honest, I kind of forgot I even mentioned it . Today I found a package on my doorstep.


Still can't figure out if it's a cat or a rabbit. There are two modes, rainbow and normal light. What should I name it?"
happy,"I am working out and feeling great.  I have a job that I enjoy.  My marriage is better than it ever has been.  My relationship with my kids is better than ever.  After so many years I am in a good head space.

Last year I almost killed myself several times and everything seemed hopeless.  

But now colors seem brighter.  Food tastes better.  It’s great to wake up to a new day every day."
happy,"A day ago I posted about how happy and excited I was that I made a plan to visit my boyfriend suddenly! And he was surprised a lot! But today he surprised me back by proposing me 😅🥺 So apparently he had plans to propose me before but the ring wasn’t delivered on time , so he was planning to propose me later this month. But since I visited him suddenly, he took this opportunity to surprise me back by taking out the ring at this magical hike we had today. This is probably the best thing ever happened to me, the uno reverse we all need in life ! 😭🤍✌️"
happy,"Yesterdays workout turned into a slightly longer session than planned. I bought myself a luxurious licorice pipe (not the usual (Swedes knows which one I mean) , but an unknown, more expensive fancy variant!) and planned to treat myself after the session if I did well. The session felt... meh. I go to the reception to return a belly belt I borrowed for maxing out on the leg press, and then I see a guy yelling and causing a scene because his gym card is canceled for some reason. He's loud and creating an aggressive atmosphere. The receptionist is young and thin (less than 50kg), looking very uncomfortable. She has called the police. I try to talk to him.

- If you can't get in, and she only sees that it's blocked, and asks you to contact customer service, then there's nothing more to do. It's not her fault that your gym card is blocked.

But he talks about how badly he's being treated and tries to turn it into a racist thing.

- Call the police, do it! I'm not leaving this place!

And that I'm on the wrong side of what's right and wrong in the world.

- I swear to God! Jalla!

He gets up on a chair and starts waving and screaming even more. I tell him that when he's threatening and aggressive, it's not okay. It's still not her fault. If she asks you to leave, you have to leave. She's the one in charge here.

But he refuses to listen and just keeps rambling about... I don't really know what. That if it were the other way around, he wouldn't be treated this way, and blah blah blah. I wasn't on the HUMAN side, but on the INHUMAN side!

Mkay. Sure, but now she's asking you to leave. She can't do anything about it. He tries to call customer service, but as they don't answer at this time, he gets upset about how unfair it is. Gets up on the chair again, screaming and waving, hitting the lights above him, causing them to flicker. After maybe twenty long minutes of meaningless ranting, three police officers finally come and remove him, and talks to the receptionist.

I go back and stretch a bit. After a while, she comes by, and I see that she is upset and close to tears. First, she apologizes for what happened; it's not something I should have to endure. But she was glad that I was there and handled the situation. I say no worries, it was obvious I had to do something. And SHE shouldn't have to endure this at work. 

I go shower and sauna, and when I'm done and on my way going through the gym to the entrance, I see her again, and ask if she likes licorice. 

-Yes, she answers curiously. I offer her my luxury licorice pipe. She is surprised and wonders if I don't want it for myself. I say it would have been my reward if I had a good session, but it was meh. And, I think she should have something good happening today. She thanked me and said it made her very happy! And that made me happy too, despite the bad session. Win-win! "
happy,"Made me happy, They seem happy. I'm filming the wild monkeys that frequent my garden and was surprised with how quickly doing this brought joy to my life...only thing is I am a bit attached now.

happy,"To all my fellow singles out there and to those that are missing/can’t be with their significant other today, remember this:

You have the ability to light your own spark.  We all want that sense of completion with someone else by our side.  We all fantasize about being whole.  The over-commercialization of romantic love makes it even worse. The truth is, we are whole just as we are.  Sure we all come with baggage but that doesn’t make us incomplete.  This is your reminder that you don’t have to go through today feeling alone.  This is your chance to pour all of your love into the most important person in your life: you!

Right now, I’m sitting with a glass of my favorite (Verdi) wine, snuggling with Bruno the stuffed red dragon and my two cats.  I bought myself flowers again this year and added the purple rose because they are my favorite.  I lit my favorite Apotheke candle.  There’s salmon broiling in the oven that I’ll be pairing with  broccoli and basmati rice.  Later, I’ll cuddle under the blankets and watch a movie.  It’s all I’d want to do with a partner.  Why should being single change that?

How are you spending today?  I hope it is filled with peace and not a reminder of what could have/should have been.  Seize your happiness.  You deserve it."
happy,"These past few days, my boyfriend and I have been spending a lot of time on calls, sharing what our everyday lives look like. Since then, I have learned a lot about him: he hates when people eat messy stuff in his car, he likes a slightly messy room but not too much, and he really thinks it's important to have a cup holder when you're drinking in bed. But most importantly, when he sleeps, he snores a little bit. It's the cutest thing I've ever heard in my whole life. Maybe I'm just so in love, but hearing him sleep like that, with his little sounds, makes my heart so fuzzy. I love every little thing about him, every little quirk."
happy,"I’m so excited. This is a job I’ve wanted for ages and I feel like people take me seriously and respect me professionally, which I’ve never really experienced as I’m still 20 and in college. 

I get to go to a new city I’ve never seen before, go to fancy dinners every night and get paid for it!! Also I feel like I’ve made my dad proud of me so that’s an added bonus. "
happy,"I (19M) turned 19 on Tuesday last week and my girlfriend (19F) made it so special for me. She bought me a huge bunch of flowers and I legit cried so hard in her arms. Ive never been given flowers before and it meant so so much to me. For anyone reading this, buy someone you care about a bunch of flowers it will make their entire year!!!!"
happy,"Today my mom called me and asked if I wanted some framed photographs my grandfather made. Immediately I said yes. My grandpa is going on 84 however growing up him and my grandma had a huge hand in raising me, my brother and two of my younger cousins one of which I actually got an invite to his wedding in the summer. I looked at the photography and it's absolutely beautiful and he took in one of my favorite vacation spots. tawas Michigan. So double meaningful. I'm very happy to have this in my home. Honored really. And when he does eventually go I'll have something very nice to remember him with."
happy,"After going through so much school, putting out so many applications, I was offered my dream role right after graduation and I am so excited and happy I can’t even sleep! Really just wanted to share how at peace and grateful I’m feeling in this moment :) "
happy,"I've been so depressed the last few months because of an incident I don't want to go into. Its been a long time since I've felt genuine happiness but today is just the perfect day. I feel so relaxed, as if all my problems just went away. There's a really nice sunset out (if only there was a few extra degrees so I could sit out on my balcony), and I'm listening to my favorite tracks on my phone. Usually those things are more of a treatment, but today its a cure. 








I feel free for the first time in so long. I wish this feeling on everyone"
happy,"This is what I came into. My inner child couldn't be happier, and I started happy jumping upon seeing kid you not.

First time I tear up out of excitement and being emotionally touched
The cutest thing someone has ever done for me 🥺❤️"
happy,I still feel happy to be a part of this country 😊 flaws of course but how else would I be able to help if not becoming a citizen. 
happy,"Even in the middle of the storm, there are small places to breath"
happy,"Like the title, I’ve moved far away from home and I had never done this before. I always lived in the place where I was born. I honestly never even thought I would move. Last year, I was promoted to manager for a company and I had a LOT of work to do. I needed help, but then lost some accounts and didn’t need as much help anymore. Someone told me early last year that they should’ve taken the opportunity to move back home when they had the chance (to my hometown - he was helping me for a while, and he lived 400+ miles away.)

It was a seed in the back of my mind to POSSIBLY eventually move. His best friend moved to my hometown to help me full time. Meanwhile, I grew feelings for a friend who said he was moving to where this guy lives. I still thought about moving, but thought there’s no way I would move for a guy just because I like him. (We aren’t in a relationship, but I am crazy about him. lol) 

Well, as luck (or fate?) would have it, I lost even more business at work through no fault of my own. I was desperate for a change because I needed to make more money. I don’t have a roommate and I have bills I need to be able to pay. No other job applications were going anywhere. My friend that I mentioned above suggested that I move out of my hometown, and I thought it might actually not be a bad idea to have more work in a bigger city, like he said. I thought really intensely about it and talked about it with my closest friends and family. 

Even the guy who worked for me was afraid of losing his job. I told him not to worry because I was thinking of moving to take his best friend’s place - he was in a hard spot financially too, and would have help in my hometown to get back on his feet. Every single person I told about the possibility of me moving said to 100% do it. (Well, aside from my parents, but they have been supportive even when I told them my crush moved away. I thought they were the crazy ones for that. LOL)

I got home from vacation after thinking long and hard about moving, and I drafted the email to send to my boss about moving to two possible locations. One because I had family there, and the other because I KNEW the other guy wanted to move earlier in the year back to my hometown. I had just spent my vacation near where he was living, and I liked it - but I was NOT thinking of moving when I took that trip. Lo and behold, when I got back home, I nearly went negative in my bank account. I had to return socks and underwear because I just couldn’t afford it. My car payment was coming up and I was so scared. 

I thought about if I were to move, what amount of money would I need to do it? The number $5k popped up and I figured that would be just enough to move. I had no idea how I would get the money. As if by magic, within 3 days, I never went negative in the bank and I had $5k to my name in addition to everything I needed for bills that month. My boss was totally willing to facilitate the move and the guy was desperate to move back home, even though he didn’t WANT to leave. He HAD to leave. 

It’s just been amazing how smoothly this has all worked out. I was terrified of moving here because I don’t know anyone very well, but I do have some friends in the surrounding areas whom I hope to get to know better. The cherry on top is that the friend I have feelings for lives here too, but I am not going to push anything with him. I didn’t move here FOR him, but it’s definitely a big perk, in my opinion. I don’t even know if he likes me at all. But it’s just so weird how everything has panned out. I am not complaining though. I absolutely adore this place already. 

All my life I thought I would hate it up here. I can’t think of a single negative other than my small family and my closest friends aren’t here. However, since moving, I am actually talking to my friends and family MORE than before! They care about my whereabouts and how I am doing so they are checking on me more often and making more of an effort, which is really nice. 

I am just so elated to be here in my quiet little bubble - in a beautiful city, which so far hasn’t given me anxiety much at all, despite it being so much bigger than where I am from. Everyone has been so incredibly friendly and, again, everything has been so smooth. It feels like it was meant to be. My mind is blown by this experience and honestly, it’s only been 48 hours, but I don’t think I’ll ever move back home unless I absolutely have to, and even then, I am sure it would be temporary."
happy,"We are both in our second year of high school and she sent me this

It bloomed I'm so happy ☺️"
happy,I live in Florida so pretty soon it’ll be too hot to spend entire days out here so we enjoy it when we can!!
happy,"So, I’m 21 and have gone through a lot of hardship over the last few years. This has made me change my general plan for life a couple of times. But, after switching my major a few times, I decided I want to get a BS in IT. When I’m done with school, I want to move to Las Vegas. I was born in Las Vegas and lived there for the first 10 years of my life. Besides, IT does much better in Vegas than the state I live in. 

I also figured out, after soul searching the last month, that I really am trans (I had a period where I questioned if transitioning was the right choice for me and I figured out it was and I want to continue it!), I don’t want kids, I’m a stoner, and I’d be content being single. However, if someone comes along that’s fine too. I’m very eccentric (very neurodivergent and crazy life), so if I’m gonna find someone romantically, they’re gonna be in a place like Las Vegas. Basically, what I thought I wanted in life is very different then what I “wanted” in life at 19. I put quotations as I used to think, “I should live this way” instead of thinking of what I wanted.  

I fell into a deep depression after a break up around thanksgiving as I questioned what my true purpose in life was. I asked, “In spite of all of my challenges (like my 4 diagnosed mental illnesses which are all severe), why do I choose to continue to live?” Realizing all of this tonight was like answering that question which has been plaguing me for a while now. 

I’m much more happy and content with this plan. I hope I end up happy with it and the ways reality differs from my plan."
happy,"Got paid for my voice acting today!!!!

I AM SO HAPPY!!! I got paid for doing voice acting work—my very first paid VA work of the year! It wasn’t much but it makes me very happy! Makes me feel like I’m doing something right!! I only said a few lines, haha!! BUT STILL!!!!!"
happy,"Getting groceries with my(31) wife(29) and our 3 month old baby yesterday, I saw a kid standing in the middle of the aisle blocking someone trying to get their cart through. He turned and noticed them, stepped to the side and said ""oh excuse me!"". The parent around our age said ""good job (kids name) that was very polite!"". He said ""thanks, we have to think about other people too right?"", to which she replied ""that's exactly right"" and gave him a firm one arm hug.

Thinking about that this morning, it makes me so happy to see people teaching compassion and thoughtfulness nowadays. She seemed to be very involved as a parent, and I can't wait to be/teach that way for our daughter. Idk why but that thought is hitting that happy cord so hard today, just felt like sharing!"

happy,"Hey all! I've been on the weightloss train for nearly 3-4 years now! I am only 5',3"", so at my biggest of 215lbs, I was quite heavy for my size. 
I began to simply just eat less, take in less sugar, reduce my portions, and begin walking (10k steps a day). 
Towards the end of my journey I began running and working out as well, which helped me over come plateaus, as well as reducing sugar to nearly 0. 
I am now 120lbs. I may lose 5 more pounds to be 115lbs, but we'll see. It took me nearly half a decade, but I can rest now knowing it is finally accomplished! "
happy,"
So I’ve officially made it a month away from drinking and about 2 months away from morphine. And considering all the shit I’ve been through recently and the fact I was drinking a handle of vodka every school week and every weekend for over a year I am incredibly proud of myself for not relapsing. I went from chugging my last drink in last then 30 seconds to only smoking an 8th in like a week. I’m also kinda happy cuz I just turned 16 and now I don’t have to worry about me being stupid and trying to drink and drive. Honestly all of this only happened because my girl didn’t like me when I was  drunk. and considering I’m not the only one in my family who has had a drinking problem and I’ve seen how alcohol ruined my grandparents marriage and eventually led to my grandfathers death at 45 I honestly feel kinda strong for once."

happy,"So basically I (20 M) have lost a shit ton of weight from say weighing 120 kilograms to right now weighing 83 kgs. I regularly go to the gym and I have them muscles too. There's just one teeny tiny issue. I was a hell of a glutton when I was chubby, and that habit still persists in the form of my sweet tooth and binge eating, though not often. 
Today, particularly, I'd eaten more than I'm supposed to, on my calorie deficit, by say 200-300 kcals, and all the PTSD came rushing to my head. I know it's not healthy, but this does not happen often. Okay so, my girlfriend rudely cut my video call cause her friend called and the girls had a nice time putting on face masks and stuff (when my girl (19 F) had told me before that she would do that with me on video call, while we talk.) So obviously this made me feel bad, and along with the PTSD, made my emotions avalanche down the fkin mountain. 
Cue me calling my girl a bit later, she goes ""tell me what's the matter"" in the most bored voice ever. I couldn't stop myself, tears started flowing down my eyes. I didn't know how to tell her what the matter was, and that made my emotions plummet even more.
However, after a while, I gathered composure, told my girlfriend the reasons, that I missed my father, and my grandmothers every single day, think about the days they were alive, and that I get motivation from them, to succeed. I told her about the PTSD regarding my body image issues, and what I consider as freedom from this: I want to be able to rip of my shirt and wear shorts without worrying about my physique whatsoever. (Not to mention I want that athletic physique and am working towards it). 
Where I knew that I'd won, with her as my girlfriend, is when she listened through everything, then at the end, told me stuff I exactly wanted to hear. That how she'd shown a pump picture of mine to one of her guy friends and how the guy praised my physique, how she'd storied a picture of me with a beautiful Persian cat (she was absolutely wonderful, the cat) on instagram, and how her friend replied ""Where were such beautiful and wonderful guys when I was searching for them? What kinda black magic did you perform that suddenly you get such a great guy to be your boyfriend?"". I feel absolutely elated right now.
There was this day I wore a semi-transparent shirt out, and my girl said today: listen babe, yk, I know we went to a temple that day but I could not help thinking unholy shit to do to you.
I am so fucking happy right now. i hope I marry this girl someday."
happy,I was able to buy the house mostly using money my mother left after she passed away.  And I think she'd be proud and happy knowing the hard work she put in while she was alive helped give me a new chance.  She always wanted me to live happy and now I am.
happy,"I'm celebrating my 21st at Disney with my momma and we've been many times since I was 6 years old. Because I'm chronically online, I would call her immature, lazy, boot licking capitalist because this is the only place I've been on vacation. She just told me this will probably be our last trip together since I'm getting older and graduating soon. I started crying uncontrollably because I realized this is our happy place. This is OUR special place we make memories. I'm constantly surrounding myself around miserable people because of my mental health conditions alongside me being queer. There is beauty in traditions and my momma loves me so much and more than anything in the world."

happy,"I came out to my parents about being non binary (AFAB) when I was 16, I've known it since I was 15 and rn I'm 20. So it's been a long time and I'm quite sure of myself about who I am and how I feel.
A few years ago my mom kept telling me that it was a phase and my dad even told me that I was just following a trend that that if I ever did anything to make my body appear less feminine then he wonnt consider me his child anymore... Other than that everything was great in my life.

But now my parents are suddenly trying to accept me!
I have no idea what changed but today my mom came to my room to give me some of my dad's old clothes, we're going to attend a wedding soon so I needed good clothes for that, and she gave me my dad's old suit!
I was so happy that for the first time she didn't ask me to wear a dress, and my dad accepted to lend me his old clothes for a formal event without trying to convince me to wear something else first😁😁😁
And when I tried everything on my mom looked at me and I could see all the love in her eyes and she just said ''you're becoming a beautiful person''
I almost cried, I'm french so we have a very binary language and she used the word joli/jolie which means beautiful but it sounds the same way no matter if it's masculine or feminine (unlike beau/belle), and she said person and not young woman as she usually did

I'M SO HAPPY 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
They're both 50+ and they're actually trying to change how they acted and how they were raised (like considering anything LGBT+ just a young people trend) to accept me as me 🥰 I love them so much and I just want to share that joy with everyone and anyone right now 🥳❤️"
happy,This is my girlfriend of 7 years and both of our kids 5 year old girl and 3 year old boy.

happy,"2 years ago, when I told my family and friends I wanted to release all original music as a fully independent artist, and try to turn it into a full time living, almost everyone I knew didn’t believe I’d get very far… I know realistically the vast majority of people that try don’t get far, so I could understand where they were coming from (the music industry is insanely hard to make a living in). But I would never know if I didn’t try…So I did. And I worked so hard, and so many times I asked myself why I was doing this…So many times I wanted to give up. But looking at this milestone, I feel very happy and proud that I didn’t give up. I’m also earning a decent part time income from my music too! The next goal is full time! Just thought I’d share this, and to not give up on your dreams if you truly love doing them! :)

happy,"I've been playing as a non-singing guitarist
in rock bands for a long time and finally started taking singing lessons 2 months ago to boost my confidence.

My wife has heard me sing plenty at home in private and has always given that supportive, but vague, ""yah, you sound OK"" response.

My instructor said I really had to own and believe in the lyrics of the songs I sing, so l've been working on singing with more feeling and expression.

We've been together for more than 30 years and I'm still crazy about her.

This morning I was hugging my wife, and while looking in her eyes, I started singing her the Beatles version of ""Til There Was You""...and she got quiet with watery eyes and a beet red face!  Then we burst out laughing.

My voice may not be perfect and I may be an old, but maybe I still got it!😻"
happy,"Hi guys, 

So I’ve been doing some meditations that have really been working for me lately and I have a few things in my life that are going well and am in a couple blessed situations. I’m starting to have moment of real happiness on levels I don’t know if I’ve had before. I think mostly due to the meditations because it’s not externally dependent. 

I still have daily struggles and things I’m working on. A lot more than people know. Even the fact that I’m working on my struggles and am seeing them getting better is making me happy. I’ve had a lot of suffering in my life, especially within myself about myself and to witness imrovement is like witnessing a wonder, a miracle. 

I keep running into the situation where I tell people about the good things in my life, in a super excited way, (it could even be a new positive way I’m perceiving the world), and I feel (or at least perceive (I could be projecting)) it making people uncomfortable or I feel that I am being too much. I notice within me a fear of being unrelatable expressing the goodness in my life. I’m afraid of making people jealous. I feel like I need to then tone down the positive thing I said with something more “down to earth” (though I don’t because I see that urge rising from an anxiety about how others perceive me and to not try to “fix” it) 

I feel like I need to be more tactful than I am and I’m curious if anyone has any advice? One thing I’m trying not to do is tone myself down for others comfort (I’ve often done this when going out to not make other girls jealous) but also I don’t want to come off as chaotic or make people feel bad. 

On some level writing this does make me feel like it’s okay to be unapologetically happy/well. Maybe that’s how relaxed people are and I’m just learning/relearning it. 

Grateful for your input.
Thank you . "

happy,"I'm a few states away from home for a conference this week, and during some downtime I looked up things to do nearby. Turns out the art museum a short walk away had my FAVORITE sculpture on display, I didn't even know it had been put into a collection!

happy,"I had a girl I’ve been dating over for dinner and drinks last night to celebrate NYE.  Things started getting physical so I suggested going to the bedroom.  It was a hard no.

I was a little bit puzzled (we’ve had sex before).  She then informs me she has her period, appears visibly upset and apologizes.  I sort of start laughing; now she looks puzzled.

I tell her I’m chuckling at the apology; there is absolutely no reason to be sorry and I couldn’t be happier just giving her a kiss at midnight and waking up beside her tomorrow (she’s never spent the night).  I offer her a heating pad, pillows and to run out to grab some midol; whatever she needs to be comfortable, she need only let me know.

The result was a lovely young lady, stunned by the thoughtfulness and filled with appreciation.  Though I invited a ‘date’ over for dinner, we decided to become exclusive and I woke up beside my new ‘girlfriend’ the next morning.

What a great start to 2022.

Edit: inclusion of exclusivity."
happy,"I quit my job but now worried about money

Quit my job, but worried about money.

I had to do something very hard today. I had to quit my job. It was not a decision I took lightly. Unfortunately it was my first real job and it was sponsored by vocational rehab, which makes me feel bad about quitting. However, I need to prioritize my mental health. I am a 25 year old individual living with multiple disabilities including type 1 diabetes, adhd and anxiety. The job was causing me a lot of stress and anxiety. I spent 4 hours at the therapy office yesterday. They are also adjusting my anxiety medication, I’m still testing adhd meds. I would like to work but I’m not sure what I want to do. Sitting around and collecting disability is not an option. There has to be something im good at. Both my boss and vocational rehab are proud of me for prioritizing my mental health. However, I am still worried about money, despite the fact that I live with my parents. If I don’t work, I won’t be able to have an income. Money is a big stressor in my life. And I’m also trying to not feel like a failure. Maybe I can craft or sell something on etsy. Or freelance/gig work. There has to be something I’m good at. I’m just not sure what. My plan for now is to priorize my mental health, and I asked my therapy office if I was able to come in twice a week so we shall see what they say. I’m probably not the first one to quit my job due to stress. But I’m afraid I’m
The first one to quit their first job. Thank you for taking time to read this post. It was very hard for me to write."
happy,"
I have been bullied for a lot of my childhood for various reasons and one of them was me being a little chubby (I was not even overweight) so it naturally destroyed my self confidence and caused me to develop anxiety and even depression at one point. I also struggle with binge eating while stressed. 

Now growing up my parents might have made a few mistakes here there that I could not handle but lately they seem to talk to me in a more positive and mature manner and it warms my heart. I know for a fact that they had to unlearn certain behaviours and ideas to have this outlook.


For example the other day I noticed that my favourite pair of jeans started ripping apart near the thigh area and I was beating myself up for it getting torn because I have put on weight since I bought them two years back. My parents casually reassured me that it was just a piece of clothing and I can always get a new pair that fits me perfectly. They also said clothes are meant to fit you and not the other way around . It might not sound much to them but for me it was a huge deal. 

Also I love dressing masculine and wearing clothes from men’s section all the time, even though I personally think clothes are genderless but corporate world doesn’t really think the same right, so we happen to have a lot of stores that exclusively sell menswear. When I first started to ask my mom to take me the store she immediately took me there no questions asked, she never says anything to me when getting clothes from the men’s section. I know this is how it should be but I know a lot of friends who aren’t allowed to do the same.  I mentioned this to her and she casually went clothes are for comfort and people can wear whatever they want as long as they feel good wearing them 😭❤️

These things may not look like a big deal to everyone but I know little me would be jumping with joy right now."

happy,"“How is her brother doing?”

Weird, right? Ill make it make sense!

My best friend passed away 2 years ago, we have guardianship of her 17f daughter, and are active in her 18transM’s son’s life. We’ll call him K.

I have boomer parents. I would gently correct them when they referred to the kids as “the girls,” or used the incorrect pronouns for K. I was understanding that they were going to mess up here and there because of the generational gap, but figured after consistent gentle corrections, they would get there sooner than later.

I was wrong. After nearly 2 years, I felt I gave them more than enough grace to get it right. My mom has been the main culprit of the two because she always wants to talk about the kids, while my dad never really asked/talked about them as often (man of few words type). I started getting more aggravated and upset every time my mom would ask “how are the girls doing?” After 2 years, I just felt like my parents just didn’t care enough to even try to understand. I stopped bringing the kids around my family because I felt like it was always a negative experience for them, and refused to subject them to that kind of environment.

Fast forward to last week: I was talking to my dad on the phone. He was asking about 17f because I had mentioned she was starting school again soon and she just had a birthday. After we were done talking about her, he said the sentence:

“How is her brother doing?”

0 coaching. No correcting. Just him using his own words. 

I couldn’t believe it and actually stuttered a bit after that one sentence. That was the first time I heard one of my parents affirm his gender identity. 

My dad does care and has been listening. My heart exploded. I had hella tears.

I love my dad and am happy."

happy,"I cleaned my house after living in a pretty big mess after 2 years. For context: I live with my mom and grandpa. my mom is a hoarder and also battles manic depression so she buys a lot of things to comfort herself (not hoarders tv show level but clothes, shoes, journals, pens, books). My grandpa hoards food (not sure why) and doesn’t like to get rid of anything even if it’s expired from 2019. I also can be messy and not put things back where they go. I spent a year being mad that I had to clean the place at all because I felt like I shouldn’t have to clean up after perfectly capable people and I knew they wouldn’t make an effort to keep it clean. I guess I got over that last week because I cleaned the entire house and had about 6 garbage bags full of things to throw out that hadn’t been used in years. What really prompted the clean was my mom essentially went to stay with her sister and didn’t give me any warning or anything. I guess I felt like if the house was clean she’d come back home. This was a super long rant but anyway I’m just proud of myself that I have continued the efforts of keeping the house clean and putting things back where they go even if my grandpa and mom don’t contribute because I realized if I want the house to stay clean, it’s going to have to be me doing the clean up.

happy,"my boyfriend and i are both 16. were immature, sometimes a little petty, but undoubtedly in love. my mother died before i met him, but since he’s known me he’s supported me through the grief of losing her and even has visited her grave by himself on his own time. he helps me talk about her, and says that he wishes he could have known her. it means more than he knows.

i come from a drug addict mother and angry father, so my model for a relationship wasn’t the best. i’ve messed up with him, i’ve said things i didn’t mean when i was upset, but he’s been nothing but patient with me. he’s taught me how to talk things out and admit when i’m upset about something, and to not harbor my emotions.

he’s making me a better person, and i love him unconditionally. he’s the first person i’ve been comfortable enough to let him see every single side of me, mentally and behaviorally. anyways, just wanted to say there are still good people out there, and everyone deserves someone who treats them the way my boyfriend treats me!! "
happy,"I (M25) remember deploying to the Middle East and staying up until 2-3am in the middle of the desert sleeping on a litter (the medical kind) watching the Matthew Stafford led Lions beat the Matt Ryan led Atlanta Falcons. I was also there when we traded for Jared Goff. My Marines (I was their corpsman “medic”) were from Southern California so I got a lot of grief, but nothing could tear me apart from my home team.

Years later, I remember my girlfriend breaking up with me. I got drunk and sad while I watched the Jared Goff led Lions beat the Matthew Stafford led Rams, winning their first playoff game for the first time in 32 years.

It sounds dumb how much a sports team could effect your mental health. But fuck man, I needed that shit so fuckin badly both times. I often think about the happiness that team gave me when I was at my lowest, shit gets me every time. 

I lived all across the country and had plenty of people just chirp in my ear about how I should just give up being a Lions fan and just join their fan base and I never did. There’s something special about facing adversity or how ____ and ____ isn’t good enough and coming back on the other side better, showing them they were wrong. I think we can all relate to that in some level. You can say it’s dumb, it is a little… but that made me happy and that’s all I need.

happy,"I don't have a college degree but scrounged hard to climb a ladder and managed to get software engineering level 2 yesterday! My boss asked to talk to me and I thought it was about a new application I they had mentioned they wanted me to work with but he had an offer letter for me to sign instead!


I don't really have friends or family to talk about it with so l'm posting here if that's okay. Started from an entry position analyst to engineer in 5 years, now I'm here after 4 more years. I don't have my parents anymore so I guess I'll look for phrase on Reddit 🩷"
happy,"Just remember guys there are good things and people in the world, you just gotta find them :) thank you couple wherever you are now!"
happy,Just comment if you want one!<3
happy,"I’m so excited. This is a job I’ve wanted for ages and I feel like people take me seriously and respect me professionally, which I’ve never really experienced as I’m still 20 and in college. 

I get to go to a new city I’ve never seen before, go to fancy dinners every night and get paid for it!! Also I feel like I’ve made my dad proud of me so that’s an added bonus. "
happy,"Today I turned 33.  My boyfriend (33M) decided to take me on a small trip to a forest an hour away that he knows is one of my favourite places. 
Things were weird between us the the last couples of weeks but I was happy that we took the trip.
We walked through the woods and I was walking ahead of him and he called out my name. I asked him whatif everything is okay while still looking straight ahead. He asked me to turn around. There he was, holding a ring in his hands, smiling at me and he popped the question. 
I said yes. 
I still can't believe it happened .
I can't believe I'm saying this but I'm engaged and this is most definitely the best birthday I've ever had."
happy,"We found her about 10 years ago as a stray in NYC and she's been with us ever since. She got out of a window once and was gone for over 24 hours but she came back, almost knocking at the front door.   
She's been my little special buddy for so many years now and knowing I can still scoop her up and give her kisses warms my heart. She's got the best personality and she's very friendly and affectionate - basically the ideal cat. Snuggles with me like a teddy bear almost every night. She's so perfect she has a heart marking on her side!  


I just needed to happyrant about my wonderful kitty. Gave her some love a moment ago and wanted to share it :)  
"
happy,"I love reddit podcasts, but they can be so saddening, especially the stories about pulling ""pranks"" like lying about tragedies or physical harm. I love to do the complete opposite with my boyfriend, and last night was my favorite. He woke up yesterday and the first thing he said to me was ""I am craving white birthday cake."" so I figured, what's a birthday cake without a birthday party? Here's the prank... his birthday is in July. We gave him the ultimate surprise birthday party when he got off his mother's day restaurant shift."
happy,So I wanted to share that something rly good happened to me in my career/job today and I usually share these things with my gf of 5 years but we recently broke up and I have no one to share the happiness im feeling right now so I thought I'd just post it here :) 
happy,"I didn’t want cats. But these two little guys are here now and I’m so glad they are. 

My older one was a bony 6-month-old stray last winter that begged my mom for help, he demanded attention. He wanted love so much that the thought of sending him to a shelter where he’d be alone in a cage broke my heart, so I took him in. My younger one was a 1-2-month-old kitten who went on an adventure. She climbed into my roommate’s fiancée’s car while she was delivering food in a trailer park and wouldn’t leave. She took the kitten home, but her dog didn’t get along with it. Based on how she described the kitten, I again couldn’t send it to the shelter, so I took her in. 

Both live with me in my college apartment. It took some adjusting for them, but it was worth it. They’re best friends now, I love seeing them together. They play fight constantly, I can tell my older one is holding back and my younger one is learning how to catch him off guard. They love to eat at the same time as well. The older one always sleeps right by me and the younger tends to sleep on the ground or in the cat tree. When I wake up in the morning, they’ll both wake up too, and and younger one will always hop up on my bed purring and immediately go touch noses with my older one. 

We had to travel back home for Christmas, my older one has bad separation anxiety and he would’ve been alone for a couple days so I took both of them. They were stressed in their new environment. So when we went to bed, they cuddled with each other, paws on one another for comfort and support. 

I’m so glad I’ve been able to provide them a good home. Watching them grow up has been an honor. From putting their first collars on them to seeing my kitten see snow for the first time, there’s so much to smile about. They’ve got so much time to spend with each other, I’m looking forward to it. I’m glad I’ve not only been able to give them a home, but that I’ve given them siblings and best friends, another cat that they can trust and play with."
happy,"I am working out and feeling great.  I have a job that I enjoy.  My marriage is better than it ever has been.  My relationship with my kids is better than ever.  After so many years I am in a good head space.

Last year I almost killed myself several times and everything seemed hopeless.  

But now colors seem brighter.  Food tastes better.  It’s great to wake up to a new day every day."
happy,"After long hard months of grinding applications, interviews and dealing with the anxiety that comes along with it I have finally received a job offer from a company that I really like.

I know these moments of happiness are short lived, but this is one of the bigger milestones I’ve achieved in my life and I am extremely proud of myself.

Always remember that if you are willing to work hard enough to achieve something that it is always possible! Don’t give up!"
happy,"I (31F) dropped out of school more times than I can remember I finished undergrad last year and found a master program that was tailored to exactly what I want to a T. I applied to this school twice in undergrad and got rejected. This has been the school of my dreams since I was a child, I grew up around it, supported the teams since I was a kid and always drove by it wanted to go to it. I got the acceptance letter today and started crying. Everything that has happened to me has lead to this point. The happiest moment of my life, if I can talk to my younger self who never believed she could end up here I would hug her. I can’t wait for this next step in my life."
happy,"i do some challenge to keep living. there’s a thing as “tell your family “i love you”

i never had a family and ppl i knew was very much toxic and wanted to control me VERY VERY much

so i say “i love you” to my friends, they my family. no matter if we talk every day, once at week or if i see them once at month

you all my family. and i say, we says “we loves you”

don’t know if it’s counts then, but “family” is someone who make me to feel safe, love and accept me. not someone who controls me, insults and makes me to cry

so, yeah, we love you all and we happy to say it "

happy,"Wasn’t expecting this, but it’s one of the only things I’m happy about the past few days. I’m celebrating the little things in life.  Lol. 

I really respect this guy and his podcast is my favorite. I listened very religiously to it last year for a good portion of the year, and the year before that. It’s changed my life in a lot of ways. I was super stoked that he started following me recently and then even more excited to get a comment back from him! 

I’m such a nerd lol. I never thought he’d even know I existed. Haha. 

The internet is weird and people are people. I have to remind myself of this, but it’s still nice and I’m happy about it."
happy,"My mom has been a green thumb enthusiasts. Her garden is a beautiful mess with half edibles and flowers and it's a little slice of her happy place.


But she has always been strictly a roses, carnations and dahlias only gardener with the odd daisy, marigold or iris thrown in. Wildflowers to her were the equivalent of weeds (lol).


A few weeks ago, I had been feeling down and I saw a video of a wildflower meadow that looked stunning. I mentioned to my mum about how happy they made me due to the bright colors, the bees and butterflies it attracted. That's it, that's all I said. She nodded and didn't say much. 


Well this morning I saw the tall grassy patch she had left to 'recover and compost' before she planted veg in had wildflowers. 


She seeded the bare patch for me without asking. Just because it made me happy. It made me feel so loved in that moment. Mom cares. She heard and saw what I was feeling and decided to build me a small wildflower patch so I could sit outside and escape my depression.


After years of a rocky relationship, we are finally building a solid foundation with wildflowers."

I was in my social work course watching a mock therapy group and one of the girls said her partner is her comfort person and I thought of him because he's mine. He told me that ""dreams"" by the cranberries was playing at his work (🥺) and it reminded him of me (omfg I'm winning). Life is funny and this just really reminded me that there are people who love you and think about you even when you're not around. "

happy,"We (24F) and (22M) met on an app called Yocket, which is popular in India for graduate abroad studies. One day, she texted in the group about the decision deadline for a particular university. I saw the message and made a joke, which made her laugh. Intrigued, I wanted to learn more about her, so I checked out her profile. It turned out she had applied and got an admit from the same university where I had applied.

I decided to direct message her, asking about her application process and the decision. What started as professional college talk gradually turned into more personal conversations about our day-to-day activities and common interests. It all began on March 19th, 2023. Her age-related freakouts, even when we were just friends, were adorable.

By July, we found ourselves flirting without even fully knowing that we were “flirting”. We gave each other nicknames—I call her Goldie, and she calls me Twee. The nicknames stemmed from a funny story; she forgot few things, so I jokingly called her Goldfish (with its 15-second memory), which eventually led to Goldie. Twee came from star > twinkle > twee; she called me Starfish (with no brain) after I said something silly.

As I was about to fly to the USA for my higher studies on August 8th and yeah she couldn’t make it this year cause of some personal reasons, she sent me a long, heartfelt text when I was at the airport. It made me realize I was leaving something behind in India, even though my dream was to live in the USA. The text stirred emotions in me that I had never felt before.In the USA, I struggled to express my feelings or ask her out, but on August 13th, I finally did it, and she said, ""Fuck yes."" Despite not meeting or speaking on calls, we texted for hours every day. However, we knew long-distance wouldn't work without meeting in person, so I decided to visit her after my first semester, which was six months away. We didn't meet before I flew to the USA because I'm from a city that's 350 kilometers away from hers, and we also didn't acknowledge our feelings while I was living in India. We regretted that after August too much, and it was hilarious.

After a month, we started doing calls and decided to meet in person, skipping video calls and only sharing pictures. Although we knew we were in love, we didn't say it outright; instead, we used phrases like ""I purple you"" and ""I l you."" Purple became our color because One day, while I was assisting her with the application process, she thanked me with a purple heart instead of a red one. Later, she revealed that she didn't want to give the ""wrong impression"" by sending red hearts lol. From that moment on, purple became our color in everything, from hearts to flowers and to act more goofy, like Avengers' ""I love you 3000,"" we chose 2468 as our special number.

In January, I flew to India, and on the 6th, we finally met. It was nerve-wracking as she sat at Cubbon Park in Bangalore, facing away from the entrance which was extremely adorable. When I tapped her shoulder, she turned and we hugged for solid two minutes which was the best moment of my life. I spent the entire January with her, When we began our personal conversations, we discovered a shared love for a special dessert: blueberry cheesecake. We always dreamt of sharing it in person, so after 6-7 months of anticipation, we finally had our first cheesecake date in January. We also exchanged bouquets of purple flowers and now that I've flown back to the US, I miss my baby Gold so much. I just wanna be with her all the time. I love her 2468."

happy,"I know it might be nothing special for you but for me - a person who feels like doesn't make significant progress in English it's quite special. It's more important for me as I didn't attend any special classes to prepare myself for this exam and tbh I didn't prepare at all so it makes me proud of myself that I could pass it relying just on my overall English skills. As a student of applied linguistics that includes studying English in my course, I often feel that I am not even close to the English level of the most of my fellow students and that's true for sure but this exam has shown me that I'm not that bad at English."
happy,"The day me and this cutie met irl, we were supposed to go on our first date. Instead, I totalled my car 2 hours from home and 2 hours away from him (I'm ok!). He drove all the way to get me from the tow shop, drove to my hotel and stayed with me so I wouldn't be suffering alone because lawd I was some pain from being jarred so hard! Despite the dramatic start, our second date weekend was amazing! We went to a festival, watched Tenacious D's Pick of Destiny, I introduced him to Puerto Rican food and culture, and best of all, he met my grandma and she loves him! I am so happy, sooooo happy! I feel so lucky. :)"
happy,"
I've been in a really good mood lately. 

I just had a woman hit on me for the first time ever the other day. I was super nervous, but it left me feeling amazing.

And recently I've somehow (through no real effort on my part) managed to become surrounded by very thoughtful, kind, and genuine people.

I've felt more at ease with my life in general.

It almost feels like my world turned around on it's own, and it brought a lot of joy into my life."

happy,"2 years ago, my partner worked at Habitat for Humanity as a family coordinator, where she would help families apply, understand the criteria, and screen families for eligibility. There was a lovely immigrant family of 4, a mom, dad, teenage son, and younger daughter who were incredibly sweet and hardworking. The problem was that they applied 4 times, and each time, they either had just the smallest bit over income or they were not selected. My partner saw how hard working they were and how much this would turn their life around. They lived in a small 1 bedroom apartment and spending way too much on rent.  On the 5th application, my partner made sure that everything was correct, they were eligible, and she went to bat for them during committee selections, ensuring they got a house this time. They talked so often throughout the process and the mom called my partner her “daughter”, that is how close they became. Then one day, my partner gets home and tells me that this family got approved to get a new house after 2 years of rejections. I was floored with emotions as I had become so invested in their wellbeing. 

Now, my partner was the one that would be calling and letting the families know that they would be eligible to receive a home. I was so invested in this family that I made sure to listen to the phone call that she made to the mom of the family on speakerphone. As soon as she called, the mom thought something else was wrong and she didn’t get a home this round. Instead, my partner broke the news that they would be getting a house. That was when I immediately started balling my eyes out. I’m crying, my partner is crying, and the mom was crying.  It’s really hard to describe the amount of love the mom had for my partner and the gratitude she had for my partner doing everything she could to get them a home. I cried for a long time, even after they hung up. I’ve never felt so happy for someone else being so happy. To this day, when I think about that phone call, I tear up and could cry just like that day. I’ve never cried from happiness this way for anyone. As I write this, my eyes fill with tears thinking back to that beautiful moment. 

Later, the mom brought my partner a whole cake and other expressions of gratitude. It’s a moment that will stay with me for the rest of my life. Today, this family is thriving more than they ever have and we keep up with them. "

happy,"Getting groceries with my(31) wife(29) and our 3 month old baby yesterday, I saw a kid standing in the middle of the aisle blocking someone trying to get their cart through. He turned and noticed them, stepped to the side and said ""oh excuse me!"". The parent around our age said ""good job (kids name) that was very polite!"". He said ""thanks, we have to think about other people too right?"", to which she replied ""that's exactly right"" and gave him a firm one arm hug.

Thinking about that this morning, it makes me so happy to see people teaching compassion and thoughtfulness nowadays. She seemed to be very involved as a parent, and I can't wait to be/teach that way for our daughter. Idk why but that thought is hitting that happy cord so hard today, just felt like sharing!"

happy,"When I finally got up the courage to go to the dentist, I discovered that I needed an old crown replaced, 2 fillings, and, worst of all, 2 root canals. I am terrified of drilling and each time I had to go to an appointment over the past few months, I had to steel myself. However, this entire few years that I have gone without seeing a dentist, I knew that it was just a matter of time before I had a major problem, or even caused myself a serious health problem. It was like I had a shadow of worry always hanging over my shoulder, even in happy moments, and I knew the only way to dismiss it was to finally go to the dentist and let them fix every single problem.  

I had been saving up for a new car, so that money is all gone now, but I don’t need a new car the way I need the blissful peace of mind that comes with finally resolving a serious problem that has followed me for years.  

And actually, it ended up being not the worst case scenario. I didn’t lose a single tooth. I didn’t have to get any implants. If I do better at taking care of my teeth going forward, I hope I can keep all of them. And I hope I don’t ever have to do a root canal again. And my mouth feels so much better.  

edit to add: I just want to describe some things that happened during my first appointment. I was so terrified I was trembling violently. During the part where they were examining my teeth, with various sharp implements, every time it hurt so much, I would flinch violently. Tears began to stream from the corners of my eyes. Until finally the dentist said “Do you need a moment?” and I sat up and the tech fetched my water bottle from my backpack. All of this was in the FIRST appointment, and all they were trying to do was find what was wrong, and what needed to be fixed, and I was so afraid, and my injured teeth hurt SO much. It was, all of it, built upon old childhood trauma, drilling when I wasn’t really numb, an elderly dentist chasing me around the chair and then yelling at my mother not to bring me in again if I was too stupid to let him help me.   

Anyway. I somehow made it through. Perhaps that first appointment _was_ the worst. Worse even than the root canals. "
happy,"This is so weird , but a few days ago my boyfriend and I went into a little no-contact stage after a small argument we had over something petty .

Well yesterday after like 2 days of no contact , I go to message him on instagram and the second my message delivered, I received a message from him on text message 😂

happy," I've been the happiest I've been for at least the past five years. No real complaints, no real worries. I mean, little day to day things like in a sitcom, but nothing crazy. I get up not worried about hating my job, don't think I have any real enemies, have a wonderful family and have the means to take care of them. Not religious either, so this is not fueled by my love for a higher being.

I found what makes me happy and don't really need anything else. Delighted to share my positive vibes if anyone needs some."

I don’t know what exactly I did to get this, BUT IM NOT COMPLAINING YIPPEEEEEE"
happy,"Hi everyone!

So my girlfriend and I (both women <3 if that's an issue for you, please just don't interact with this post) started dating at the end of January this year. This was after my ex-boyfriend and I broke up a few weeks before (we were together 4 years but it had been over a year that it wasn't working out. I don't want comments on this, you'll understand why later).

I have a lot of anxiety around relationships. My ex verbally abused me for the first part of our relationship, and then he was never physically there because he had to stay back home for understandable reasons. I was unhappy. I did things that hurt him too, and I've looked into why I did what I did and am learning to overcome what happened between us (the things he used to say to me in anger outbursts).

Now I've been friends with my girlfriend for 3 ish years now. I always thought she was so gorgeous and funny. I got to spending more time with her and next thing I knew, I was falling in love. I don't know what I did to get so lucky. Whenever I come forward about my feelings about something, she NEVER gets mad at me. She's so calm, so chill. She reassures me gently, and listens to me while explaining to me why this is okay, that I am valid. When I'm down for whatever reason, she makes me laugh without a problem. I can do anything with her and we can make it fun! I laugh harder with her than anyone else. She engages in things that I like and genuinely enjoys them, and vice versa.

The other day, we were snuggling and chatting in bed. I don't remember what she said, but it really hit home and I just felt my eyes start to water. She asked me what was wrong, and I just looked at her and said ""I just realized how unsafe I felt in the world before you"". She smiled and pulled me in, she let me cry on her for a few seconds.

She lets me talk about my ex and what happened. She knows I'm far from romantically or sexually interested in him anymore. She's so kind about the fact that I do miss him sometimes as a friend (I mean, 4 years with someone and talking almost every day is hard to let go of). I don't think about it often, really. She lets me talk about the things he did/said to me that hurt me deeply. I mean even yesterday we were talking about some of the horrible things he said and she looked at me and said ""I want to show you what a soft love looks like."" I just stared at her in awe and shock. I was frozen in place, just...speechless. She makes it safe for me to express excitement about things I love, she doesn't judge me for the things I enjoy, and SHE DOESN'T GET MAD AT ME!!! She doesn't insult me beyond what we both agree are jokes, she gently redirects me towards healthier behaviors for my mental health and for the relationship, we're both working together to be healthy and I just...wow....She's even coming home with me for Easter weekend (we don't celebrate but hey, why not).

I'm beyond happy with her. Maybe it's too soon to tell, I don't know, but I want to marry her someday. I really think this is it, that she's my future wife. She's currently asleep in my bed. I want her to be my love for the rest of our lives. She is truly and unequivocally the most beautiful person I've ever met (inside and out). I can't see a day where I don't find her funny anymore, where I don't find her attractive anymore, where I don't want to run to her to tell her about my day. I want to share my world with her. She's my best friend and more. I've never been happier, and I've never felt more like me.

If you read this whole thing, thank you so much :) I know it's a lot, it's messy, and honestly I can't even say everything I feel about this woman because I just don't have the words to express the deep, honest love I have for her. I wish you all the most WONDERFUL day!"

happy,"After 3-4 years of increasing exercise intolerance, I was diagnosed with a heart problem (SVT) 3 months ago. I'm only 40. At the time I could barely walk for 5 minutes. After medication I was up to 15 minutes walking in December. On Saturday, I completed a 2 mile walk outside (normally a big migraine trigger)! I haven't felt this good in 18 years! And the walk was for migraine awareness and education, so I learned about advocacy programs! This is a huge accomplishment for me and I am so incredibly happy. I'm actually tearing up just thinking about it! Now I can work on weight loss and socialize more, it's been absolutely life-changing."
happy,"I’m traveling in Korea at the moment.  Japan last week.  Life is good despite all the info to the contrary.  Find time to enjoy and reflect on how far you’ve come.  We are living in the best of times, believe it or not.  Hugs to all. "
happy,"Even tho it’s quite embarrassing I wanted to share this. This is Caesar my poodle puppy who is ready to greet me early every morning. This means I have to get up and out to walk him first thing, something that I COULD NOT and WOULD NOT ever do before I had him because of my agoraphobia. He has given me more independence and has made me progress so much faster. He even helps with my panic attacks. But most importantly I love him and he makes me happy!"

They spend the evening laughing, reminiscing, just being adorable. Now here's the cool part – word gets out, and suddenly, the whole neighborhood catches this happy bug.

People start doing little nice things for each other – helping out, checking in. It's like Mr. J's love move sparked this happiness wave in the community.

Lesson learned? A bit of love goes a long way. One sweet gesture can set off a whole chain of good vibes. Who knew a recreated first date could kickstart a happiness epidemic, right? "

happy,"I just wanted to share to everyone that I am truly happy. The past couple of weeks, I have spent my afternoons and nights outside on my back porch just enjoying life. Sometimes I will watch my phone, or I’ll browse Reddit, but just being outside in the bliss, cool, and calming air just makes me feel some kind of way. Pair that with the beautiful sounds of the birds, and the frogs in the distance. It all just puts me at ease. Most of my life has been pretty stressful, especially now that I’m graduating high school in less than a month. To be able to enjoy the creations of God with the moon shining, the chirps of the birds in the trees, the speckled sky littered with stars, and the gentle sway of the pine trees… I’ve rambled. Point is guys, I truly feel happy. I have nothing to complain about. I have great friends, great parents, a cute little chihuahua, supporting teachers and staff at my school, and most importantly what seems to be a great future. No idea what I’ve done to deserve it all but I’m grateful. Just wanted to share my emotions because seeing life at face value, excluding all negatives, is so special to me. "
happy,"Hi everyone. Sorry that this is quite long...I had this experience in December and typed out how I felt, but I never got around to posting it. I wanted to share what happened so I’m just putting this into the aether.

What is your personal background music to make a mundane action become an epic tale to overcome your own daily anxiety of existing? I had 2 upbeat songs that lightened up my soul (like “Hey, Soul Sister” and “Get Back” by THE one the THE only Luda!), and then 1 slow song to root me back down (I had the Mr.Kitty song “After Dark”), followed by another BANGER alert “Paint the Town Red” by Doja Cat... straight banger…anyways...and then something simply great. The first four weren’t necessarily in that order, but this song was last. The soul lifter “Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros - Home”.

The mundane actions of vacuuming, cleaning, organizing, doing the dishes, emptying the cat bin, etc., all became the act of a Hero overcoming adversity. Showing that even those that only managed to shower today are at times doing their best…you even completing one of the many tasks that need to be done is inspirational and shows you are still pushing.

I must say though that I just chose my playlist of liked videos and put it on shuffle so these are songs I already liked but they made the day feel so much more personal because I connected them to being the best version of myself in that moment. I felt in sync with myself. I felt…happy.

I belted “HEY SOUL SISTA!” at the top of my lungs for my friends. I did some shit talk dancing while listening to motha’ fuckin Luda! I did some sensual hip wiggles while listening to “After Dark."" I felt so sassy during Doja...wagging my finger back and forth and bobbing my head.

I was even happier knowing that Amanda was out looking for a Christmas tree. I was listening to “Home” again when I thought that…what a beautiful song. We are moving forward in our lives and it's spectacular. We get to put ornaments and our tree topper up soon! The tree topper we use is my Beanie Baby Creepers. I got him when I was young and I started putting him up there in my early 20’s so it just kind of continued on.

Moving on though! Amazingly, I pushed myself further and completed the next mundane task…I ate food. That’s impressive if I must say so myself. Maybe not to some…but I did it. I deserve to eat. And right now I think THAT is impressive too. :)

I hope this makes sense... It felt like such a beautiful out of body moment for me and I want others to try to experience that perspective of just being themselves and that doing simple things is in of itself beautiful. If the simple things are hard at this point in time for you, please keep telling yourself that you can do hard things."

happy,"I know this sounds silly. 

But my friend is going through a bad divorce. He's been abused for 30 years by a wack job. He got kicked out of his place, and I offered my couch. 

We're sitting on my bed, watching a movie, and high. He has had a terrible day, so I'm trying to make it better. I noticed he took a picture of a gift I got him and posted it to a Reddit sub. 

I asked what he was doing, and he got so excited. He told me he was in this nice sub and everyone is so welcoming, that his post got 700 karma. He is very, very new to this app and is older, so he's not up to snuff with everything. 

But he just lit up when he showed me how excited he was that people were talking to him and that they liked his post so much that he got ""a little karma"" 

This man has cried his eyes out for hours tonight; seeing him beam about something so small just filled my heart. I'm overjoyed to see him this excited! 

Anyway, I just, really want this man to be happy, so for this small thing to really bring him joy just makes my chest burn.

Edit: 

If you all want to give him some love I'll link his art post. It'll make him very excited that people enjoy his art. He only ever shares it within his work space. Not sure why but I think it'll get him excited.

Mother in law, future sister in law and I really love tea so I really hope she likes it. Both of these ladies are absolute gems to be around and I cannot be more excited to have my future sister in law join the family ❤️. She is so sweet and considerate and sassy and I love her so much! And mother in law is an absolute doll. Anything and everything she can do to help, she'll do. She's a tiny spit fire of a woman and won't hesitate to show you what-for like she's 8 feet tall lol. 

My blood family has never treated me half as well as these ladies do and I am just so blessed to know them and have them in my life! 

So here's to a sneaky surprise!  *shush* no telling!🤫

Edit: She loved it and no one spilled the beans! We got to have a lovely little tea time with some wonderful conversation and some very delicious tea, yummy pastries and little finger sandwiches! She's actually thinking about using the location for her bridal shower 😊"

happy,"As an artist, I’ve never been as prolific as I have been this year and even though I beat myself up about it, it’s amazing to think back on the year about ALL the paintings I have done. I’ve probably done over twenty or thirty paintings this year of varying sizes and this was after YEARS of doing maybe just less than a handful. I think last year I did two or three. Prior to this year I was making friends who didn’t even know I was a painter or went to school for art. I’m proud to say that narrative has vastly shifted! I’m so proud of myself for painting more even though it’s really hard to get started some days."

Well last week, one of our other coworkers told me that she actually refered to me as her boyfriend for the first time while complaining that our manager didn't give us more shifts together, and a couple days ago she called me for the first time instead of the texting we've been doing to tell me she loves me.

happy,"Today is the day my life will change FOREVER!!!!

Even as a welder, the most I have ever made doing back breaking work was $20.60 an hour. I currently make $18.22 an hour as a lead IT processing technician. Since 2021, I have been going to school for an A.A.S in multimedia/web development. I joined this company in 2022 and worked up to a lead IT processing technician. And today I was just offered a software developer job for $50,000 a year.

I wont lie, yes, I worked INCREDIBLY hard. I am in the honors society as the VP of communications and public relations for our school chapter. I have maintained a 4.0 GPA (I am graduating in May, I have 2 classes left that I am currently taking) and am so close to graduating with highest honors in my community college. I won an award last year in our state that only 55 students out of 200,000+ community college students called the All-State Academic Team and won a scholarship for Women in STEM. I am a very ambitious and have strived so much through this

BUT, I would have not had this job opportunity if I didn't have luck on my side. Working at this company, I found out they have a software developer team, and did my best to network with them and the adjacent IT team since I started. I had people who I made friends with who spoke my name when the software developer team asked about possible internal candidates. Just like it was luck for them that they actually had an internal employee who lives close enough to their facility who just happens to be going to school for web development, I just so happen to be lucky to work at a place where I could even move up like this.

There were 192 candidates, some of them being other internal employees. And I got it. me. I can't believe this.

I get being hurt and losing the ability to trust, I can understand it, but I don’t think I could really just hate people in general. I love people’s faces, not just the eyes, but the noses and the smiles and the way skin crinkles.

happy,"First of all, English isn't my first language so please understand. 

I come from a country and a community where dating culture isn't very big. Me and my brother have a 8 year age gap (he's younger). As a result, we don't relate to the same stuff, share similar likes/dislikes or even talk a lot about our personal lives or choices. Although I find a friend in him and he's been protective, caring; he barely talks about his friends, or problems, etc. 

But today! Oh boy, I'm still smiling ear to ear!
Today he called me out of the blue( lives in a different city) and asked me for an outfit suggestion because he was going to go meet this girl he has had a crush on. That alone, made me so happy! In that moment, I knew he found me helpful, I knew he trusted me with that as probably my parents would not approve of him skipping classes to go meet her, and I was happy that he came to me when he felt like he was stuck.
I gave him a suggestion, appropriate for a first date (of his life) and he left. I was fine, happy that he was happy. It was just a little meet at a cafe at evening, they decided to have some snacks, talk etc and head back their own ways.

Fast forward three hours, HE CALLED me.. n he told me how great the date was!! I NEVER expected he'd call and share that with me! N he was so giggly (I don't know if that's even a word, sorry) and chirpy and happy and nervous and so much more lol! He told me, that she looked so beautiful this evening, that he couldn't utter a word. So he scrolled through Instagram, luckily came across a picture of  beautifully arranged flowers and he sent that post to her with a message that said - ""you look this beautiful today"". My little brother, ladies and gentlemen!! He's 19. 19!!! We never have seen anyone go on a date except in movies and stuff ig. And this guy was like 5yo just a couple years ago 🥺🥺When did he grow up so fast! 

N to top all that, he thanked me - he THANKED ME for helping him know how to treat a girl right! He thinks I'm nice. He trusts me. He ACTUALLY looks up to me!!🥺
I. Am. Melting! 
I'm happy a ton! Sorry if this is too long. To the ones who stuck till the end, you people are my angels. I just wanted to share this. ❤️

happy,"We (24F) and (22M) met on an app called Yocket, which is popular in India for graduate abroad studies. One day, she texted in the group about the decision deadline for a particular university. I saw the message and made a joke, which made her laugh. Intrigued, I wanted to learn more about her, so I checked out her profile. It turned out she had applied and got an admit from the same university where I had applied.

I decided to direct message her, asking about her application process and the decision. What started as professional college talk gradually turned into more personal conversations about our day-to-day activities and common interests. It all began on March 19th, 2023. Her age-related freakouts, even when we were just friends, were adorable.

By July, we found ourselves flirting without even fully knowing that we were “flirting”. We gave each other nicknames—I call her Goldie, and she calls me Twee. The nicknames stemmed from a funny story; she forgot few things, so I jokingly called her Goldfish (with its 15-second memory), which eventually led to Goldie. Twee came from star > twinkle > twee; she called me Starfish (with no brain) after I said something silly.

As I was about to fly to the USA for my higher studies on August 8th and yeah she couldn’t make it this year cause of some personal reasons, she sent me a long, heartfelt text when I was at the airport. It made me realize I was leaving something behind in India, even though my dream was to live in the USA. The text stirred emotions in me that I had never felt before.In the USA, I struggled to express my feelings or ask her out, but on August 13th, I finally did it, and she said, ""Fuck yes."" Despite not meeting or speaking on calls, we texted for hours every day. However, we knew long-distance wouldn't work without meeting in person, so I decided to visit her after my first semester, which was six months away. We didn't meet before I flew to the USA because I'm from a city that's 350 kilometers away from hers, and we also didn't acknowledge our feelings while I was living in India. We regretted that after August too much, and it was hilarious.

After a month, we started doing calls and decided to meet in person, skipping video calls and only sharing pictures. Although we knew we were in love, we didn't say it outright; instead, we used phrases like ""I purple you"" and ""I l you."" Purple became our color because One day, while I was assisting her with the application process, she thanked me with a purple heart instead of a red one. Later, she revealed that she didn't want to give the ""wrong impression"" by sending red hearts lol. From that moment on, purple became our color in everything, from hearts to flowers and to act more goofy, like Avengers' ""I love you 3000,"" we chose 2468 as our special number.

In January, I flew to India, and on the 6th, we finally met. It was nerve-wracking as she sat at Cubbon Park in Bangalore, facing away from the entrance which was extremely adorable. When I tapped her shoulder, she turned and we hugged for solid two minutes which was the best moment of my life. I spent the entire January with her, When we began our personal conversations, we discovered a shared love for a special dessert: blueberry cheesecake. We always dreamt of sharing it in person, so after 6-7 months of anticipation, we finally had our first cheesecake date in January. We also exchanged bouquets of purple flowers and now that I've flown back to the US, I miss my baby Gold so much. I just wanna be with her all the time. I love her 2468."

happy,"I cleaned my house after living in a pretty big mess after 2 years. For context: I live with my mom and grandpa. my mom is a hoarder and also battles manic depression so she buys a lot of things to comfort herself (not hoarders tv show level but clothes, shoes, journals, pens, books). My grandpa hoards food (not sure why) and doesn’t like to get rid of anything even if it’s expired from 2019. I also can be messy and not put things back where they go. I spent a year being mad that I had to clean the place at all because I felt like I shouldn’t have to clean up after perfectly capable people and I knew they wouldn’t make an effort to keep it clean. I guess I got over that last week because I cleaned the entire house and had about 6 garbage bags full of things to throw out that hadn’t been used in years. What really prompted the clean was my mom essentially went to stay with her sister and didn’t give me any warning or anything. I guess I felt like if the house was clean she’d come back home. This was a super long rant but anyway I’m just proud of myself that I have continued the efforts of keeping the house clean and putting things back where they go even if my grandpa and mom don’t contribute because I realized if I want the house to stay clean, it’s going to have to be me doing the clean up.

happy,"Hi everyone!

So my girlfriend and I (both women <3 if that's an issue for you, please just don't interact with this post) started dating at the end of January this year. This was after my ex-boyfriend and I broke up a few weeks before (we were together 4 years but it had been over a year that it wasn't working out. I don't want comments on this, you'll understand why later).

I have a lot of anxiety around relationships. My ex verbally abused me for the first part of our relationship, and then he was never physically there because he had to stay back home for understandable reasons. I was unhappy. I did things that hurt him too, and I've looked into why I did what I did and am learning to overcome what happened between us (the things he used to say to me in anger outbursts).

Now I've been friends with my girlfriend for 3 ish years now. I always thought she was so gorgeous and funny. I got to spending more time with her and next thing I knew, I was falling in love. I don't know what I did to get so lucky. Whenever I come forward about my feelings about something, she NEVER gets mad at me. She's so calm, so chill. She reassures me gently, and listens to me while explaining to me why this is okay, that I am valid. When I'm down for whatever reason, she makes me laugh without a problem. I can do anything with her and we can make it fun! I laugh harder with her than anyone else. She engages in things that I like and genuinely enjoys them, and vice versa.

The other day, we were snuggling and chatting in bed. I don't remember what she said, but it really hit home and I just felt my eyes start to water. She asked me what was wrong, and I just looked at her and said ""I just realized how unsafe I felt in the world before you"". She smiled and pulled me in, she let me cry on her for a few seconds.

She lets me talk about my ex and what happened. She knows I'm far from romantically or sexually interested in him anymore. She's so kind about the fact that I do miss him sometimes as a friend (I mean, 4 years with someone and talking almost every day is hard to let go of). I don't think about it often, really. She lets me talk about the things he did/said to me that hurt me deeply. I mean even yesterday we were talking about some of the horrible things he said and she looked at me and said ""I want to show you what a soft love looks like."" I just stared at her in awe and shock. I was frozen in place, just...speechless. She makes it safe for me to express excitement about things I love, she doesn't judge me for the things I enjoy, and SHE DOESN'T GET MAD AT ME!!! She doesn't insult me beyond what we both agree are jokes, she gently redirects me towards healthier behaviors for my mental health and for the relationship, we're both working together to be healthy and I just...wow....She's even coming home with me for Easter weekend (we don't celebrate but hey, why not).

I'm beyond happy with her. Maybe it's too soon to tell, I don't know, but I want to marry her someday. I really think this is it, that she's my future wife. She's currently asleep in my bed. I want her to be my love for the rest of our lives. She is truly and unequivocally the most beautiful person I've ever met (inside and out). I can't see a day where I don't find her funny anymore, where I don't find her attractive anymore, where I don't want to run to her to tell her about my day. I want to share my world with her. She's my best friend and more. I've never been happier, and I've never felt more like me.

If you read this whole thing, thank you so much :) I know it's a lot, it's messy, and honestly I can't even say everything I feel about this woman because I just don't have the words to express the deep, honest love I have for her. I wish you all the most WONDERFUL day!"
happy,"This is my life. I can't share this with anyone without coming off as boastful, but I just needed to put it into words. This is the story of my growth as a person through from being a kid to an adult through a year, from a single drunken realisation.

When I was a kid, I was, and still am, incredibly fortunate. I was born into a financially safe family with loving parents, a cool older brother. I was an athlete as a kid, smart, confident and socially liked. Kind, respectful, 'cool'. Mate's parents loved me, my friends thought I was the shit, everything was perfect. I got older, became a teenager. I had a big friend group, I was good with girls and good at the things I tried. I never tried in school and did well, and I started truly becoming a prick. I was so full of myself. I picked on anyone that was different to me to make my mates or girls laugh, I was crass and rude. I'd spend my life fucking around with my friends, not doing anything of value and arguing with people on the internet to get a rise out of them. I didn't appreciate my parents or my family, I'd show up late to important things and not bother going to things if I didn't absolutely have to. My mates started getting sick of me. My parents started getting sick of me. My brother started getting sick of me.

Then adulthood came. I was 18, I finished school with decent marks, got into a good degree at uni, and started completely letting everything go. For my entire life, everything had been done for me. I'd show up, do the bare minimum, and life started going downhill because of it. I got into a relationship with a girl and interjected myself in her life. I'd try and 'fix' things for her that didn't need fixing, and her resentment grew. She came from a rough house, wasn't mentally healthy and started taking it out on me, verbally and emotionally. My life caught up with me. I was turning in my assignments at the last possible moment, scrapping together the lowest amount of money possible to pay for alcohol, club tickets and petrol, I was putting up with emotional manipulation and hurtful insults from the girl I loved. I stopped going to the gym. I started smoking. I let myself go mentally and physically completely. I gained heaps of weight, picked up terrible habits with everything you can think of. I embraced the full on 'loser' lifestyle. I leeched off my family and made nothing of myself. Me and my ex broke up in a bad way, and I put up with the harassment for months afterwards.

I was a 'yeah I'll get around to it' type of person. I was gonna get my shit together, I was gonna get back to the gym, I was gonna work on myself EVENTUALLY. I was gonna get a tattoo, I was gonna finish uni, I was gonna get a 'real' job. Every day I'd lie to my friends, my family, but most importantly, myself. I'd lie that I was going to get things back on track and start living, but it never happened. I never started anything. I had my hand in a thousand things and the moment I wasn't immediately gratified with a reward, I quit. I was gonna make more friends and go travelling! I was going to get a high paying job with absolutely zero effort! I was so stuck in the mindset of everything being easy and done for me, that I just expected things to work out for me.

At the start of last year, I was a fraction of the human I am now. To cope with how 'hard' life was, I did everything dumb you can think of. I was a 20 year old bloke, depressed, selfish, leeching loser. All I did was party, chat up girls, eat like shit, drink too many beers and smoke too much bud, and ALWAYS fuck off any real work and ambition for a good night with my mates. I had zero self-control, zero idea, zero moderation and idea of where I was going and what I was capable of. No life skills. For Christ's sake, I could barely do my own laundry. My Mum had taken care of almost every tiny aspect of my life and I'd never even appreciated her for it. I remember going to my ex's and barely knowing how to wash dishes because I was that useless in any real life skill. Everything was done for me.

Then things got rough. My dad's heart essentially gave out, my brother who had always been a stalwart, mature and driven bloke had a full blown mental health crisis due to some physical health issues, and my family collapsed. Dad was off work and Mum was taking care of him, my brother was bedridden and lower than any low I'd seen him overcome before. And there I was; sat in my room, taking my life for granted. I was playing games into the late hours, never doing my uni course work and working a casual, extremely low-hour and low paying job, not because I was busy, but because I was lazy and didn't want to face any real work. I'd rather just sit in my room and watch every youtube video and pump as many hours into games as I could, then the weekend would come and I'd be drunk/high for the entirety of it and make stupid self destructive choices. Never saved any money or did anything for anyone farther than what I had to do to consider myself a good person. I was seeing a girl I had no romantic interest in because I was bored, taking her kindness for granted. Absolute rock bottom. My mental illness was out the wazoo. Shit was absolutely brutal and was truly my lowest low.

Then, one day, I was over at a mate's and we were playing poker. I had a smoke in my mouth and 8 or 9 empty beer bottles next to my chair and a fresh one in my hand, hair greasy and out of sorts, basically had my pyjamas on, totally mashed. I looked over at a mate to make a stupid joke and caught a look at myself in the mirror. I was overweight, my skin was a mess, I was borderline unwashed and I absolutely HATED it. I realised in a fraction of a second that all the anger and hurt I was balling up in my stomach wasn't directed to anyone else. It wasn't the people who'd put me down, it wasn't my ex, it wasn't my loving family who I perceived as 'overbearing and annoying', it was me. I'd come from a life of such opportunity and I'd squandered all of it. My life was in shambles and it was MY fault. No one put a drink in my hand or a smoke in my mouth, no one put a gun to my head and stopped me studying and working on myself. I'd done it myself. I was a total dick to everyone around me, even catching the insult to my friend in my throat that wasn't funny in the slightest; just a knee jerk reaction to something he'd said. I was immature in every sense of the word, and I was completely wasting myself, my opportunities and my life.

In that moment, I was truly, truly disgusted with myself. I loathed the life I'd wasted, and then came to another instant realisation. That didn't have to continue. I didn't have to hate myself anymore. I'm young, there was still time to put things in the right place and get it done. I didn't have to keep up with my ex's instagram anymore, I didn't have to drink myself to death to have a good time. I didn't have to spend all of my free time outside of partying playing games and being bored. There was new things to try; a whole life yet lived.

Over the next month, I made changes. I put my study on hold, which was an incredibly hard thing to do. For the first time truly in my selfish life, I sacrificed my own movement forward to take care of the people around me. I got out there, picked up another job. I started trying. I started, very slowly, turning myself back into someone I once was, someone a young me could be proud of. Someone my parents could be proud of. Someone I could be proud of. I stopped drinking for an entire month, which I hadn't done since I'd turned 18. I completely put down the bong. I booked myself into a therapist and paid for it myself, not trying to wrangle money out of my parents to put money into self growth that would go to waste. I wrote down a list of my goals. I signed back up to the gym. I stopped chasing late nights and cheap relationships.

I slipped up at times. Made dumb decisions, I hurt people. But I stopped beating myself up for my own mistakes and trying to blame circumstance or other people. I started holding myself accountable. I started showing regret and appreciation a lot more, I stopped saying 'I'll get around to it'. I started doing.

I started taking care of my dad physically, my brother mentally and giving my Mum a break. I'd clean the house and do the shopping so she could come home from work and just be with my old man. I went outside and learned to properly mow, learned how to hedge, how to weed and lay gravel. I fixed stuff in our house by myself with no direction except for google, I learned how to be financially intelligent, I learned true independence from my family for the first time. I learned that I could laugh louder and bring smile to peoples faces, I learned that within me was the ability to do anything I could put my mind to. I learned that part of my happiness came from spreading joy to those around me and making people smile. I learned to put down the lying, scummy, self loathing part of myself again. The pessimist. I started appreciating the sun more, I started spending more time just helping! I started spending real time with my brother. We became mates again. I started coaching him through his breakdowns and holding him through his panic attacks. I started kissing my mum on the cheek again and bringing my parents a coffee in bed. I started laughing with my friends instead of at them. I started showing pride in my own actions, pride in other's actions. I complimented people's clothes and their laughs, shaking more hands, working harder. I started catching up on all the uni work I'd missed and getting up earlier. I started going for runs. I starting putting greenery on my plate. I started washing up the dishes more, watching movies with my dad when he was awake, or sitting with him while he was reading. I started hanging out with my Mum and treating her to coffee and lunch, getting her out of the house. I started driving my friends around while they drank and I just smiled and laughed and got on the AUX for them. I started writing music and stories again. I put more effort into DnD characters, I stopped being embarrassed about stupid things. I started SMILING. Really, actually, SMILING.

I was going out, and I was partying, but I was drinking within my wallet and I wasn't so miserable when I was mashed. I started dancing and walking girl's to their front doors instead of just dropping them off. I started connecting with the kids at work and I started babysitting my cousins. I went over to my grandparent's house and fixed their technology, spending time with them. I stopped trying to what I considered cool and just starting doing fun shit. I tried bouldering. I tried surfing. I tried playing club footy again. I started hanging out with new people, people completely different to me. I started learning. I started to feel passion for things again. I started training muay thai because I'd always said I would.

I started DOING.

Now, here I am, emotional late at night and just so fucking HAPPY. I'm single and so content with my life and so busy that I have no interest in being in a relationship, I am overwhelmed with pure joy and so truly happy with who I am. I've lost weight. I don't smoke or vape anymore. I'm excited to wake up and go to work and come home and give my mum a hug and hang out with her while she cooks dinner. My dad's back to almost full strength and he's his old happy self, my brother is medicated and learning to become himself again. I spend less time in my room. I spend less time existing and more time living. Me and my friends are even actually going travelling next year, because I'll be graduating! We're doing a roadtrip across America and I'm so excited. I'm going to have so much fun and meet so many new people. Then I'm gonna come home, continue the life I'll be putting on hold temporarily. I'm gonna get a decent job and do my best. 

There will be pitfalls, I'm going to have bad days and meet bad people, have bad experiences but I'm stronger now than I ever was before. I can cook for myself. I can clean for myself. I help out around the house. I show my love to people. I write my feelings down and create stories that I share with my friends. I found my passion for being alive again. I've become a rock for someone very close to me that I work with every day to get her life back on track.

Don't get me wrong, I haven't fixed everything in a year. I still struggle with staying ontop of my newfound responsibilities and sometimes I'm lazy and sometimes I make dumb decisions, but I am leaps and bounds ahead of where I was. I am always trying to improve, and I can only go up from here.

One day, I'm going to be even happier than I am now. I'm gonna have a wife and kids that I can support through anything they go through, and I'm going to be a fuckin' great dad and dude in general. God fucking damn. I am absolutely ecstatic to be alive.

Life's good in the sunshine.

I had someone end up DMing me about this post talking about their own alcohol and nicotine intake and I just wanted to throw this on the end; there's nothing wrong with partying and having fun. I still go out and get pissed and what not, but the way I was doing it at the start of last year was simply as a coping mechanism. I was completely out of moderation and completely out of my head, and I was way overdoing it. There's nothing lame about getting drunk and having a good time, as long as you're doing so healthily and being safe! Everything in moderation."
happy,"SO and I are gen x, come from suuuuuper broken homes. We met just over ten years ago, are celebrating our 9th wedding anniversary today. We’re having Jimmy John’s to celebrate while we save money for the move. 

He comes from the troubled teen industry, I come from your standard fucked up adolescence. 

We’ve been apartment dwellers since we met and have talked about a house but it had to be damn near perfect to make us commit. It was a long distance dream we clung to in our darkest hours. 

We found one.  Georgian Colonial, made from brick. It’s gonna last generations, like us. It has a small waterfall in the backyard, only a few neighbors, lots of trees and privacy. The Seller sat on the house until he found the “right” buyers and it turns out that was us. We got one hell of a deal. We’re paying less than half a mil for a house that’s worth 3/4 of a mil easily. 

We don’t feel like we deserve it but we’re damned if we won’t enjoy it. 

I’m a firm believer that the Universe gives you what you need. Not god, not fate, but something similar. I don’t know, but it seems like there was a time we needed something, and it’s been provided, and it’s not the first time. 

We needed a larger apartment? One was open in the same complex. We needed a family type car? First one we looked at was perfect. SO’s job sucked monkey balls? Here’s a random call about one and oh, hey, we’ll pay to interview and move you … 

We’re just so fucking happy right now and it sucks to share that with friends and family who aren’t necessarily feeling it. 

I wish I could share this feeling with all of you.

happy,"Writing this while sitting beside my mom.😃

Just got home from a different city where i stay for studies but not very far. *When i live alone, i do the most idiotic things.* However, I slept happy and relieved yesterday thinking how i finally got time to get back home to my family. I woke up pretty late but was so happy and did all the chores then got ready. I feel at peace, no pain, no stress, no regrets, just pure serenity. I just needed to share it becos this is rare. I don't feel the best these days so i'm very grateful to be happy today all becos i'm home, sweet home, sweet parents. It felt really good to see my parents after a couple of months, i know it's not been long but it felt like forever. Saw my brother, his smile as bright as a sunny day. Before i return back to feeling shitty, I wanna thank universe for whatever i have today and for this life:)

Lastly, thank you sm for reading."

I have been in school for well over a year, which was a huge transition for me from who I was to begin with. But, today is my first day of classes in person... Over 20 years since I last sat in a classroom. I am excited for this. This is another step towards who I want to be. Here's to the future, and the work we put in to make one."
happy,"Grew up in a small poor town in rural midwest. First of my family to go to college. I did two years of community college first while working at the mall and lived with parents, then I transferred to University and I only needed a loan for my final semester. That was in 2012. Not gonna lie, I was pretty much couch surfing/homeless til 2014 where I decided to learn programming (my major in college was history, what a waste of time).

Got my big break in 2015, but still living on the edge and needed roommates until 2019. In 2022 I joined a tech startup which I am still working at. I have zero debt outside of a mortgage (got a house at 3% in 2022 whew!), and have savings of a bit over $500k thanks to some smart investing. I got married in 2019 and have a daughter, and life is pretty good as I get to work from home and my wife doesn't have to work. My hours are flexible at work as well as long as I get my tasks done, that's all they care about. No set hours.

After expenses we have about $3k left over every month to invest or do something fun with.

I am pretty happy. Hopefully it lasts."

He got me a gift and I can’t stop bawling my eyes out. No one besides family, of course, has ever gotten me a gift before.

I’m so happy!"

I can’t stop smiling when I see a mirror just to look at my teeth!
happy," For some quick context I am an adult male. So to get right into what the title says. My whole life I always felt ""fat"" or ""ugly"". I'm not really sure what had convinced me to think this. I would not starve myself but would purposefully avoid meals or avoid drinking literally anything. This was the case for a good majority of my life so far (I'm 18 now just for reference). This train of thought, obviously damaged my self image, just leading to even more self conflicting issues. around the age of 15 I realized that I wasn't straight, turns out I was bisexual, (""great another reason to hate myself""). I felt even more isolated from others in my life. When I was 17, I accidently came out to my brother and step-mom, I remember going back to my room silently panicking, then venting to my best friend over text. The very next day my dad was joking around and said something like ""you saving yourself for that perfect girl....or BOY!?"" and I very stupidly said yes to both, realizing what I said made me internally panic again. To my surprise, my dad (who is Christian) was very very okay with it. For the days I almost began to cry on my way to school, due to the amount of weight lifted off of me. through the last remaining months of the year I felt like I was finally being accepted. To speed up this annoyingly long story, during the months leading up to and past my 18th birthday I was hit like a truck with a wave of sadness, tried something that I'm really happy it didn't workout, opened up to my step-mom and dad about it , got therapy, and processed my feelings healthily. This lasted for a 3-4 month period. Now in the year 2024 I still have my issues that I solve, but I have this underlying feeling of pure happiness that just sits dormant inside of me. I'm not sure if its an underlying issue problem of mine. Almost every time I go to take a shower I spot myself in the mirror (I'm usually fully clothed or just shirtless). I would stop and jokingly flex and check out myself (too clarify the mirror was only tall enough to show from above my head down and about to slightly above the waist), then proceed with my shower. Even today, I felt a surge of 5 am confidence and decided to open obs and take off my shirt and started to pose and check out myself out a bit and I thought in an exaggerated way ""omg I'm kinda... hot!"". Just being able to type this story out makes me feel so much appreciation for just life and how far I have progressed in my life. I know this sounds very cheesy, but I feel that if I were to meet younger self, my younger self would be very proud of us. I still feel random surges of sadness every now and then, but I usually break free from those episodes within the week. I can now confidently and proudly say that I'm happier now than I ever been in my ongoing life, and I know now that I'm not alone and I wont ever be. So as I go to end this embarrassingly long post, I want you, the reader to know you're loved and cared about. Sorry if this is hard to understand or if the grammar is a horror show to yall, I've been contemplating typing and posting this for a stupid amount of time and plus its almost 7 am. "
happy,"I (20f) grew up with an emotionally abusive mother who neglected me and favoured my two older half brothers. I grew up on tv because I was a socially awkward kid and any friends I did have would want to hang with my brothers instead (we have a 6 and 7 year age gap. So when I was 8 they were teens). I saw that on a lot of my favourite shows there would be at least one picnic episode where the family would go to a park with the classic red and white blanket and eat out of a basket. I always wanted that. I would ask my mom if we could do it with her, my brothers and me ( my parents divorced when I was three and my dad had custody on weekends) but my brothers just wanted to go to the skatepark with their junkie friends. My mom chose them over me every time. So when I was 14 I stopped asking cause I knew that the one day I wanted with my family didn’t matter as much as wasting hours watching my brothers do the same old tricks. 
Anyway I haven’t seen my mother since I was 15 when my dad got full custody of me after my mom disappeared with her boyfriend of the week for a couple days. I have a carer cause I was diagnosed with autism at 13. I asked if we could do a picnic one day with just us fully prepared to be rejected but she said yes. So tomorrow we’re buying a basket and food and sitting on a blanket in the park having a picnic. 

Also mom… Fuck you. "
happy,i look good and i feel good - hiking five miles every morning has been glorious and the views here are chefs kiss! just wanted to share that little slice of sunshine. :)
happy,"After dealing with both clogged ears since Oct 2022, multiple ER visits, walk-in clinics, doctors, mineral oils, hydrogen peroxide, failed referrals to ENTS, I finally found an ear doctor that was willing to help me. He was able to unclog both my ears!

I can finally hear again. 

Nature, music, sounds I never heard before are all overwhelming. It’s like having surround sound!

Grateful for the small things. I am happy not to ask people to repeat themselves anymore!"
happy,"A day ago I posted about how happy and excited I was that I made a plan to visit my boyfriend suddenly! And he was surprised a lot! But today he surprised me back by proposing me 😅🥺 So apparently he had plans to propose me before but the ring wasn’t delivered on time , so he was planning to propose me later this month. But since I visited him suddenly, he took this opportunity to surprise me back by taking out the ring at this magical hike we had today. This is probably the best thing ever happened to me, the uno reverse we all need in life ! 😭🤍✌️"
happy," I am so happy. Today I was able to get my own room after having been homeless for a few months. Lost my job and previous home and this last two years have been rough, but definitely back on track now. What a blessing!

happy,"I (30f) have been married to my wonderful husband for 4yrs and we dated for 2 before getting married. My in-laws have been wonderful to me the entire time. My FIL is like a second father and my MIL is like the mother I never had. Through the duration of my relationship with my husband, I have also been helping him heal his relationship with his parents, i.e making sure boundaries are maintained and communication lines remain open and honest whilst still being kind and considerate. 

My father suddenly passed away about a month ago and it's been really difficult as it was very unexpected but my husband, my friends and my inlaws have really rallied around and made sure I am okay. I've spoken to my husband and my inlaws and it has been decided that they will move in with us into my father's house to 1: help us with some bills and maintaining my father's property and 2: help them because they do not own the place they live now and will need some help as they are getting closer to retirement age. 

My FIL is disabled and on SSA benefits. I am also trying to get disability as I have not been able to work in almost 2 years due to a variety of health issues. My FIL has been so understanding and helpful with tips and tricks on how to do things around the house while chronically in pain or what processes are helpful in going through the disability thing. My MIL has been a real trooper through all of this and has helped keep me grounded as well. My husband is actually excited to live with his parents again because while I understand that his relationship with his parents is completely different than what I had with my dad, I don't want him to go through what I'm going through with any regrets and such. 

It just feels like a spotlight in a very dark time and I really love my husband and my in-laws. Even my brother in-law and future sister-in-law have been super amazing and accommodating and kind. I really love the family I married into and l hope they know I love them too."
happy,"We found her about 10 years ago as a stray in NYC and she's been with us ever since. She got out of a window once and was gone for over 24 hours but she came back, almost knocking at the front door.   
She's been my little special buddy for so many years now and knowing I can still scoop her up and give her kisses warms my heart. She's got the best personality and she's very friendly and affectionate - basically the ideal cat. Snuggles with me like a teddy bear almost every night. She's so perfect she has a heart marking on her side!

happy,"I recently did a purge of all negative thinking, embracing only positive thinking. And it's the most rewarding thing I ever did.

Being as reflective, critical, and analytical as I am, I hit some roadblocks that made me consider if I should balance the positivity with negativity for a complete perspective. But the results are in, from experience I can see that I live my best life when I'm positive minded, peaceful, healthy, drug-free smoke-free and alcohol-free, vegan, happy, kind, and compassionate.

I recommend a great book that helped me find this lifestyle called The Power by Rhonda Byrne. It's about the law of attraction and the power of love to put yourself on a frequency to receive happy things, events, people, and experiences.

The momentum just keeps building and I keep getting happier.

I also learned that life is easy this way! I used to thrive off the thrill of challenges and overcoming difficulties, but I'm even happier when everything is smooth and easy.

I'm looking to make friends who are also living the happy life, so feel free to DM me 🕊️"
happy,"Recently Ive opened myself up expanded my horizons and gotten with some really cool people, microbiologists, actresses from london, screenwriters from new york, Bob Ross trained painters, wave scientists, hang gliding instructors.

happy,"What's so special about an office snack drawer?

It sounds funny but I have dreamed of having my own snack drawer at my own desk in my own office for as long as I can remember.  While I may not have my own office, I have a nice cubicle next to a large set of windows in the corner of the building.  It's wonderful!

I spent the better part of a decade getting an undergraduate engineering degree and graduated at 33 while working to support myself and doing extracurricular projects.  There were so many times I just wanted to quit.  I moved around a lot and changed majors at one point so it took a while to get through it all but I did it.  I now work for a company that I've always wanted to work for and I have myself a snack drawer.

It's silly but this snack drawer reminds me of all the blood, sweat, and tears that went into getting my degree and I just feel so accomplished when I turn around, open it, and grab some crackers.  I've come so far since I was waiting tables with no direction in life and it's a nice reminder that all the hard work paid off.  I can't help but smile when I think about it.  Lmao, sounds so weird typing it out but it makes me so happy!"
happy,"I can't believe I know how to play chess now. I always shunned it because I thought it required way too much thinking for it to be any kind of fun game, but now that I know how the pieces move, I feel like I can do a lot more intellectual things. Really, I learned how to play for two reasons: I quit two of my greatest addictions and really needed something new to occupy my mind. The other reason is because someone once asked me if I knew how to play chess, and it came off as them questioning my intelligence, and I didn't like that at all. So, now I finally know how to play and have so much more I can learn, which is great because I have so much time on my hands.

I'm having a blast! I can't believe I never took the time to learn this very great game. I'm so happy!"
happy," I am starting at a university this semester and I applied for financial aid, and I got it to cover school for this semester but they will also send me a refund via paper check. The amount is more money than I have ever had in my life and I am so freaking happy! I have had half of that amount before but never that much like ever. I am so excited! Also since I got a Pell Grant my textbooks and materials are covered so no need to worry about those! I can use this money to buy whatever I want! I do need my own place though I might look into that, but everything is freaking expensive! I will definitely buy a PS5 and a new laptop at least, since I need a new computer for school rather than my ancient Macbook. I wish I had direct deposit on it instead of the paper check. I will also need to find a check cashing place to cash it since I do not have a real bank account anymore. I will figure it out. I just cannot WAIT to have that check in my hand though! 9 more business days to go lol. "

happy,"I haven't had sushi in about 3-4 weeks. That changed when my parents surprised me with sushi! I was in the middle of an online class when my mom walked in (I had the camera and microphone turned off) and gave me two pieces of sushi. When I took the first bite of that first piece of sushi, it REALLY hit the spot. It just felt soooo satisfying and soooo delicious when I took that first bite. When I took that first bite, I felt that amazing feeling when you taste sushi for the first time and end up loving it so much that it becomes your favorite food. I've never felt this satisfaction and fulfillment like any other when satisfying a sushi craving like this particular moment.

I'm pretty sure that this is what a foodgasm feels like, cause I don't think I've ever felt this before when eating food, let alone trying certain foods for the first time.

I don't know if there are any more words I could use to describe this feeling."
happy,"this morning, my boyfriend had to get up before i did. our room was kinda cold so he put his blanket on top of me so i had two blankets and i was soooo warm and comfy :’) (we sleep with separate blankets because we both tend to pull it away from each other in our sleep when we share one lol)

he knows i was really anxious about going to work today so he got me a cup of coffee and brought it to me at work before he headed to work himself. i feel so happy i could cry. he takes such good care of me and i really couldn’t ask for anyone better. he’s my whole world :)"
happy,"For 24 years I've worked to grow my business.  As a single parent it has been tough.  I missed many precious moments with my daughter and I've always regretted it.  My company has been my second greatest accomplishment next to my daughter.  I'm truly happy to sell it today because I'm selling it to the employees who have done so much to make it great.

I never thought this day would come and it's been an emotional rollercoaster for the last four years. I feared what retirement would mean.  I had an identity crisis coming to terms with not being the boss.  I feared boredom but the pandemic has taught me that I don't need my business.  Connection to my family and hobbies are more than enough to provide fulfillment.

I had a hard time with selling, I built this company and it's a reflection of me.  I've had plenty of offers from larger firms but I don't want to think what would have happened to my company, my employees and it's reputation if some huge conglomerate absorbed it.

It's taken years and I am not getting as much as I could if I sold to a competitor but I'm selling to people who I know will continue the company with the same standards I built it with.  I'm selling to the employees who are the ones that made it all possible. I also know I'm the only one who will be out of a job from this.

It took 4 years to let go and today I finally signed. In a few more months I'll walk away, happily. I have many years left to spend with my family, travel, enjoy my farm, and my horses. I'm truly thankful for the last 24 years and everyone who has made this moment possible.

happy,"Disney is like my escape from all the negativity in the real world. Despite being bullied for loving it, I don't care because Disney is something I truly adore, and no one can take that away from me. It's not just for kids; Walt Disney himself said, “I make films for the child in all of us, whether we be six or sixty.” Disney taught me to spread kindness, even when faced with mean people. Whether it's movies, shows, or visiting the parks, Disney has always been my happy place, and my love for it will last a lifetime!"
happy,"So it's been a while... I don't have my own kids to be proud of or excited for on their first day of school but I can be proud of and excited for myself. I have been in school for well over a year, which was a huge transition for me from who I was to begin with. But, today is my first day of classes in person... Over 20 years since I last sat in a classroom. I am excited for this. This is another step towards who I want to be. Here's to the future, and the work we put in to make one."
happy,"Over the next few days I urge you all to take a break from the news and simply reflect on the blessings in your life and opportunities that may present themselves in the future.

Forget the bad times of 2023, reflect on what you have in your life......your health, a loved one(s), friends or the rich culture around that you may have taken for granted.

See you all next year!  "

happy,I wish I was this good at waiting 
happy,I still feel happy to be a part of this country 😊 flaws of course but how else would I be able to help if not becoming a citizen. 
happy,"Sorry for the late post, I was busy today so I didn't get my walk in until 7pm. But I made up for it with a picture of something else other than a view! I walked about 2 miles, mostly because I was given permission to walk around the properties on the hill. 

I've also decided to switch to weekly updates, as I don't want to clog r/happy with just my posts. It's just not fair to other posters. 

I love y'all and if you need anything, a pep talk, walking advice, or just wanna talk please feel free to DM me, as I'm alwaysore than happy to talk. Cheers!"
happy,"I haven't seen him in 3 years.. but a today was my lucky day! I needed to go at court for personal reasons and was already crying about him,I thought he forgot about me! ( I even thought he died even he texted my auntie!) But as soon I saw him I started to ball my eyes out! It been years since I cried happy tears,but we was able to talk and catch up but then he told me his life was terrible and that this was the best day in years! I'm still crying... because this was my best day in years to! Before me and him needed to go are own ways again,he gave me a card for my birthday with 60 dollars! But at this point I don't care about the cash I just care about the moment.. but that's all now! Have the best day folks!"
happy,Recently I've been looking for a new drill and I went to a hardware store and saw all of the drills where 100-200 bucks! So I decided to travel to (generic value store) and got a hammer drill for 25 dollars! it works amazing and has 2 modes and I'm really happy about it! ( I left the store name out of this because I don't want this to sound like a promoting a company )
happy,"So basically I (20 M) have lost a shit ton of weight from say weighing 120 kilograms to right now weighing 83 kgs. I regularly go to the gym and I have them muscles too. There's just one teeny tiny issue. I was a hell of a glutton when I was chubby, and that habit still persists in the form of my sweet tooth and binge eating, though not often. 
Today, particularly, I'd eaten more than I'm supposed to, on my calorie deficit, by say 200-300 kcals, and all the PTSD came rushing to my head. I know it's not healthy, but this does not happen often. Okay so, my girlfriend rudely cut my video call cause her friend called and the girls had a nice time putting on face masks and stuff (when my girl (19 F) had told me before that she would do that with me on video call, while we talk.) So obviously this made me feel bad, and along with the PTSD, made my emotions avalanche down the fkin mountain. 
Cue me calling my girl a bit later, she goes ""tell me what's the matter"" in the most bored voice ever. I couldn't stop myself, tears started flowing down my eyes. I didn't know how to tell her what the matter was, and that made my emotions plummet even more.
However, after a while, I gathered composure, told my girlfriend the reasons, that I missed my father, and my grandmothers every single day, think about the days they were alive, and that I get motivation from them, to succeed. I told her about the PTSD regarding my body image issues, and what I consider as freedom from this: I want to be able to rip of my shirt and wear shorts without worrying about my physique whatsoever. (Not to mention I want that athletic physique and am working towards it). 
Where I knew that I'd won, with her as my girlfriend, is when she listened through everything, then at the end, told me stuff I exactly wanted to hear. That how she'd shown a pump picture of mine to one of her guy friends and how the guy praised my physique, how she'd storied a picture of me with a beautiful Persian cat (she was absolutely wonderful, the cat) on instagram, and how her friend replied ""Where were such beautiful and wonderful guys when I was searching for them? What kinda black magic did you perform that suddenly you get such a great guy to be your boyfriend?"". I feel absolutely elated right now.
There was this day I wore a semi-transparent shirt out, and my girl said today: listen babe, yk, I know we went to a temple that day but I could not help thinking unholy shit to do to you.
I am so fucking happy right now. i hope I marry this girl someday."
happy,"It feels so euphorically good to be in love with my best friend. Have I laughed? Constantly, daily, hourly. Have I cried? Yes, tears of joy. We play video games, sometimes I watch him play, sometimes he watches me, but when we play together we always have each others backs! We go on long walks, at night, with our dog, to the beach, to different cities or exploring shops and attractions. We leave each other love notes, poetry, words of encouragement. We workout and hold each other accountable, cook meals together. We love each other’s families and feel comfortable and accepted. We have spa days together, face masks, bubble bath, scrubs, moisturizer and massages. When either of us feels sad we listen with true understanding and openness, thoughtful advice and write out plans to strengthen our resolve. We dance together, in our home, in the grocery store, with our dog or anywhere we feel like. I’ve never been so in love, at peace, accepted,  empowered and confident. I am finally happy. "
happy,"

At 26 I have finally begun to heal. 
Healing from body dysmorphia, eating disorders, exercise bulimia, severe anxiety and depression, addiction…healing my inner child whose core beliefs are that I am not skinny enough, pretty enough or worthy of love. Posting because it feels damn good to be able to look at myself and the mirror, no makeup, acne scars and all and FINALLY feel beautiful (and not feel bad about it) 
Post your healing picture - the one that makes you proud of how far you’ve come. ♥️♥️"
happy,"My mum has always been big into sewing and is much better at it than I am, I lost my quilt when I was 19 and we had a flood and it broke my heart because I was planning on passing it onto my daughter. But out of the blue this arrived. My daughter loves it and it's an absolutely gorgeous quilt. It looks like it took an insane amount of time (from all the different patches, edging and lining I'd estimate about 30 hours) and it's got a whole story that my mum wrote out by hand. The nostalgia, happiness at seeing my daughters joy and appreciation for the effort my mum went to for her granddaughter has made me the most proud and happy son/father "
happy,"I went to bed sad and preoccupied, I woke up groggy and then... 

Then I went to see my freshly repoted baby tomatoes, some of them grew a third cute leaf when I thought I fucked it all up ! New leaves on my plants (I'm a young plant parent, 20 plants besides the vegetables) give me hope, it's like starting anew, being reborn... 

What is the thing that made You smile today?"
happy,Change is a bitch. 
happy,"I know it might be nothing special for you but for me - a person who feels like doesn't make significant progress in English it's quite special. It's more important for me as I didn't attend any special classes to prepare myself for this exam and tbh I didn't prepare at all so it makes me proud of myself that I could pass it relying just on my overall English skills. As a student of applied linguistics that includes studying English in my course, I often feel that I am not even close to the English level of the most of my fellow students and that's true for sure but this exam has shown me that I'm not that bad at English."
happy,I’m living proof that we *DO* recover!
happy,"My husband got a better paying job, I'm getting in shape and plan to get out of debt and finish my Masters Degree. Anyone else feel 2024 is their year??"
happy,"Today I turned 33.  My boyfriend (33M) decided to take me on a small trip to a forest an hour away that he knows is one of my favourite places. 
Things were weird between us the the last couples of weeks but I was happy that we took the trip.
We walked through the woods and I was walking ahead of him and he called out my name. I asked him whatif everything is okay while still looking straight ahead. He asked me to turn around. There he was, holding a ring in his hands, smiling at me and he popped the question. 
I said yes. 
I still can't believe it happened .
I can't believe I'm saying this but I'm engaged and this is most definitely the best birthday I've ever had."
happy,My husband is on the path to the airlines which means we get to spend lots of Sunday afternoons flying around to get hours. Sedona is always spectacular 
happy,"I lived with my best friend when I was twenty, and then when I went back to school she got her own place. Then I moved back in with my parents for a while, then I moved into my boyfriend and then husband now ex's house for two years. And now at 29, I'm out of the marriage, and for the first time I'm gonna be living my dream of my very own apartment! I've wanted this for so long it's like a dream come true 🥰🥰🥰 I can't wait to move in on the first!!!!"
happy,"I didn’t think I made enough money but I submitted my documents and they said I make way more than the qualifying amount. This is my first big adult real-life payment, and I’m so excited to move in. It’s an awesome place. "
happy,"I (25m) have been going out with a coworker of mine (23f) for about a month now after flirting for a few weeks before that. I've been pretty gushy the whole time, but she has some baggage from a past relationship ship that's made it hard for her to fully commit to relationship. 

Well last week, one of our other coworkers told me that she actually refered to me as her boyfriend for the first time while complaining that our manager didn't give us more shifts together, and a couple days ago she called me for the first time instead of the texting we've been doing to tell me she loves me. 

This is my first relationship since a meaningless highschool situationship, and I am just over the moon and need to get this off my chest"

happy,Today I found out that I passed my Calc II exam with an 88%! I’m happy that I got that high of a score!
happy,"It's been a long journey with a lot of ups and downs, but I've finally found myself a job I can manage with hours that work for me despite my disability - and I thought I was doing ok, but it turns out I've been doing great! I work in health care and it's really important to me that my patients feel cared for and respected, so I'm overjoyed that I've apparently got so much positive feedback from my patients, as well as the other medical staff I work with. I'm not naturally a ""people person"" so it's pretty exhausting putting on my mask for every person who walks through my door, but this makes it feel worthwhile. 

To everyone who worries that they'll never be able to manage in the workplace, don't lose hope! When you're ready, keep searching and the right job could come along when you least expect it. I was struggling so much after years of trying to survive in the workplace that I ended up on a disability pension, deemed unable to work at all. Now I do five mornings a week, which isn't a lot by ""normal people"" standards, but I'm proud that I've made it this far. It's not the job I dreamed of doing and it isn't prestigious or glamorous but it's important work that I'm providing to the community. Everyone has something they can offer to the world, for some of us it just takes longer to find it. "
happy,"I started an automotive apparel and parts brand back in 2012 as a “hobby”, just wanting to make some cool stuff for friends. A few years in, I took it on full time and I’ve been doing that ever since. It’s a lot of long days and sleepless nights but I finally achieved a goal I’ve been wanting since the beginning.

Hi, i just got in high school last week and I didn't know anyone except for a friend of mine that ended up on the same school as me. A friend of her  also ended up there (wich i didn't know until yesterday). I just think it's worth to say that my social skills are terrible (expected from a reddit user lol), and i just find so difficult to start conversations, meeting people and stuff like that. On the first week i was dead silent, didn't talk to anyone, i was too shy and embarrassed, and felt like i would be a inconvenience to anyone just trying to stay in peace. Then yesterday (second week already), that friend of mine and her friend were talking to each other and they came to my desk to say something, and just stayed there for the rest of the lunch break, and we talked for a while until the class resumed. But today was even cooler, some of the teachers didn't show up on class, and we just talked the entire time about our lives. And believe it or not, it gets even cooler: we live in the same region, so we get the same buses on our way to home, and guess what: we talked the entire way lol. It just feels so nice to have someone to talk with that isn't on the internet, i was really missing that in-person social interactions haha.
Anyway, i think I've never typed so much in english, I hope only the best for y'all, cya ;P"
happy,"My two kids from a previous marriage now have mom, dad, AND papà. They looked so happy during our little ceremony; even my generally stone-faced teenager couldn't help but smile. Husband's parents served as our witnesses, and we had a lovely day together. We also have our honeymoon to Japan in a few weeks, which I'm beyond thrilled about. More than anything, I feel gratitude. For an amazing, intelligent, and funny partner, and for the wonderful and loving papà my kids have gained over the last few years. My life has gone from the very dark place I was born into to this...it feels like a fairytale. I have my partner, my babies (shared time with their dad, but for several months at a time which is great for us with school,) and then university finally, and just generally life is stable and good. I didn't know where else to share but I'm just really happy. :)

Edit: To clarify, we met on reddit 🥰"
happy,So what small things brings you joy or makes you happy? 
happy,I am in 9th grade and I was just going through so kinda rough times my ex was spreading rumors and her friend (a boy) wanted to jump me with a group of friends and it finally stopped. I had a track meet today and I couldn't run in the meet because I got injured in gym class (sprained knee). So I was taking times for all the running events and this one girl (senior) did a really good job on hurdles. When I got in the car the first thing I did was add her on snap to give her congrats on doing so well and it turned into us getting to know each other and then I asked her if being an adult is hard and she told me it wasent and reassured me it's actually fun because you can drive and get more jobs. We ended up talking about our plans for out of high school. This girl helped my fears of adulthood and actually made me exited for it.
happy,"I'm a minor, just fyi

For the past half of a year I have been in love with my friend. Their kind, and funny, and really sweet, not to mention cute. And I though it was not mutual, I even started telling myself that I just had to get over them, but recently another friend of ours cracked a joke about how they liked me so much, and when said friend left, leaving me alone with them, I asked about it, to which they responded they didn't know. I told them I liked them, and they got so excited, asking me over and over again if I was being for real. They told me so many cute things, like ""you make me feel like I'm so cared about"" and ""you're face- it just makes sense to me."" And we started dating and they tell me how they spend waiting in lines fantasizing about spending time with me. I genuinely didn't know I could be so happy."
happy,"I was tired of my life. I woke up one day and realized I have been “winging” it and “half-assing” through life. I’m not in a terrible place. I have a decent paying management job in infrastructure. But this wasn’t the life young me wanted.

I got accepted in college and I’m about to start classes. I scored insanely well on the accuplacer (after countless hours studying). And the end goal is to finally pursue my dream and become a lawyer. It was my dream all as a child. But I spent too much time in high school skipping class and hitting the reefer. I graduated high school with a 2.0 GPA. I didn’t even understand math at all. I had Fs in every math class. But I self taught my self advance algebra and statistics in a matter of weeks before my test. And I’m so proud of that. (I was proud when I was doing 7th grade math test and passing lol) 

I’m sharing on here because I’m divorced and kinda alone. No one is by my side to share the joy with me. And all my coworkers laughed at me and one of my coworkers (who dropped out in 7th grade) keeps telling me how dumb I am for doing it. I just wanted to get it off my chest in a safe area because I’m genuinely stoked. 

This is a massive vent and humble brag. "

happy,"I went septic 2 years ago due to a kidney stone that was obstructing my kidneys flows but after almost  3 YEARS (and it growing 2mm) its out due to me going to the ER and getting medicine because I knew something was wrong!

Listen to your body, and advocate as much as you need!"
happy,"I'm celebrating my 21st at Disney with my momma and we've been many times since I was 6 years old. Because I'm chronically online, I would call her immature, lazy, boot licking capitalist because this is the only place I've been on vacation. She just told me this will probably be our last trip together since I'm getting older and graduating soon. I started crying uncontrollably because I realized this is our happy place. This is OUR special place we make memories. I'm constantly surrounding myself around miserable people because of my mental health conditions alongside me being queer. There is beauty in traditions and my momma loves me so much and more than anything in the world."
happy,"I know I know; every community has it's toxic weeds that grow.

But so far my experience on Reddit has been like a walk in the park, and I'm just happy to read so many well written, sad, happy, funny, thought provoking, and interesting  posts/stories!

I always heard Reddit getting made fun of for the most part (and for good reason at times well deserved ofc) and even heavily bashed or told it was a ""cesspool of nasty to absolutely stay away from"".

 I stayed away for a long time, like the plague indeed, but I thought, ""Why not personally give it a shot,"" and see what happens, eh?

Never been a big social media person anyway since I'm not the best at being social, writing, taking pics, or navigating around strangers, so I'm beyond impressed so far with the community and am just happy my experience thus far has been good. :) 

And I'm just giddy to see what great, terrible, hilarious, irksome, and strange posts are yet to come.
Not to be sappy, I'm just happy to enjoy something new and am trying to find happy things to experience, especially with how lucky I am to be alive now.

Simple pleasures are my go to and I'm just getting older and more years are silently passing by. 
And I'm learning how to be a better writer thanks to y'all! I haven't written since high school, and am falling in love all over again with this hobby. 

I haven't seen such good writing, interesting stories, or funny jokes in ages. Impressed and can't wait to be more impressed and, somehow, even let down someday 😅if that even is something to look forward to."

This is my first post in this sub so I'm sorry if it doesn't belong here!"
happy,I’m living proof that we *DO* recover!
happy,"Five years ago I didn't see a future for myself at all. I was sleeping in my rideshare rental car, was in a crappy part time job that I hated, and was living with severe anxiety. Sixteen months ago, I took a chance and decided to give school another try. Thanks to financial aid and scholarships, tuition assistance from my current job, and support from a lot of people around me, I now have an AA in Political Science and graduated Phi Theta Kappa with honors. I have gotten offers from several schools to transfer/finish my BA, including some really good schools (one is an Ivy League school). I've wanted to move to the East Coast (NYC area) since I was 15 and finally have the opportunity at the end of this year, and will be finishing my BA there. My dream is to become a history teacher; history is AWESOME because it helps us to learn about so many facets of society and humanity, and education is a very noble, yet very under-appreciated field that I wish more people would look into. Learning is magical, and as long as we are alive, we have a chance to learn something new."
happy,This is my cat Hopper. He’s a pretty rad and chill cat and really just likes to hang out with his people. The lil dude doesn’t know it but he makes me very happy and life would be boring without him. 
happy,"An undergraduate student I have mentored for the past two-ish years applied to graduate school for the Fall 2024 admissions cycle. I helped them a lot with their applications and talked through deciding where to apply, etc. I've been getting periodic texts from them over the last few weeks as they've received their admissions (and one rejection so far) and it's been such an honor to share in their excitement. They even said I'm one of the first people they want to tell and that just put me over the moon.

Today they got an acceptance into a BIG school and one that was sort of a ""shoot for the stars"" application and I just shrieked and hollered when I got their message. Tears are streaming down my cheeks, but they are happy happy tears. What a privilege to be able to experience this joy with them. Truly an honor. I'm so lucky."
happy,"I want to reciprocate with a meal subscription because he eats to live on weekdays(mainly due to work) but I want to change things up so ideas are welcome! Also, how do people keep the sparks alive when they are physically away from their partners? "
happy,"Getting groceries with my(31) wife(29) and our 3 month old baby yesterday, I saw a kid standing in the middle of the aisle blocking someone trying to get their cart through. He turned and noticed them, stepped to the side and said ""oh excuse me!"". The parent around our age said ""good job (kids name) that was very polite!"". He said ""thanks, we have to think about other people too right?"", to which she replied ""that's exactly right"" and gave him a firm one arm hug.

Thinking about that this morning, it makes me so happy to see people teaching compassion and thoughtfulness nowadays. She seemed to be very involved as a parent, and I can't wait to be/teach that way for our daughter. Idk why but that thought is hitting that happy cord so hard today, just felt like sharing!"
happy,"I'm 32, been struggling with depression and anxiety since I was about 13 or 14. Due to reasons, I never tried medication for either, before (even when I definitely should have). Basically, I was conditioned to think that my illnesses were not real and medication was just not an option. 

About a year and a half ago, I started meds for my depression, and they certainly help, but I've still been struggling with overwhelming, constant anxiety that has been truly ruining my life. I *finally* talked to my doctor about it, and she prescribed an additional medication. Within only 5 days, I have noticed a HUGE, incredible improvement. I feel like me, again. I can breathe again (literally, I've have constricted breathing for like a year). 

I want to cry, I'm so relieved and happy to feel like I have my life back, again. I wish I had done this years ago, but I've got it now and that's all that matters!"
happy,My birthday is in 2 days! (6th april). Felt like 'treating' myself for once again [been extremely stressed so i kind of forgot about the whole self-love/worth/whatever-thing hahaha] and just thought if im already turning 16 i might aswell get myself the books i've been wanting for so long😊🩷
happy,"He loves history , spiders , technology , art and America . He’s got the most wonderful blue eyes and he likes to play in the snow like me. 

It’s never been about his appearance or anything material . I love his mind. I love speaking with him. I love every word out of his mouth. I’ve truly never felt such a deep passion for somebody. 

He’s 30 and I’m 25 and I swear I went 25 years of my life searching for a mind and soul like his . 

I love when we passionately flirt with each other and talking about breathing each other in and caressing each other . 

I love staying up late at night messaging him till I fall asleep and hearing him say his praises to me . 

C I love you forever and I want to be with you forever like this 

Give it 2 more years when I’m done with school and I think we’ll get married and by 5 more I think we might be able to have a family .. 

I wanna spend every thanksgiving and Christmas with you for the rest of my life 

C …. Please stay with me forever … you’re a beaming star in my night sky "
happy," I am starting at a university this semester and I applied for financial aid, and I got it to cover school for this semester but they will also send me a refund via paper check. The amount is more money than I have ever had in my life and I am so freaking happy! I have had half of that amount before but never that much like ever. I am so excited! Also since I got a Pell Grant my textbooks and materials are covered so no need to worry about those! I can use this money to buy whatever I want! I do need my own place though I might look into that, but everything is freaking expensive! I will definitely buy a PS5 and a new laptop at least, since I need a new computer for school rather than my ancient Macbook. I wish I had direct deposit on it instead of the paper check. I will also need to find a check cashing place to cash it since I do not have a real bank account anymore. I will figure it out. I just cannot WAIT to have that check in my hand though! 9 more business days to go lol. "
happy,He’s getting out and I’m going to ft Campbell I’m lowkey depressed since I know not a single soul out there and all my friends I had are either somewhere else or gone and I tend to stick to a crowd that doesn’t drink the kookaid 24/7 I’m happy but deeply sad any advice?
happy,"For me, the first thing I used to do was check my emails but it was super stressful, and also my whole day would be bad if the email was crucial and msg was bad but when I stumbled across this quote from Sadhguru life isn't the same. 'When you wake up in the morning, the first thing you should do is Smile. You are Alive! Is that not the greatest blessing and reason enough to Smile?'  
  
So every day when I wake up I smile not towards anybody, I just smile. This very small act has changed my attitude to look toward life :)  
  
What's your tip?"
happy,"Made lunch clearly not fancy lol. But lovely to feel mentallyand physically okay to and wanted to after a awful time and physical pain and as he always makes me gorgeous food, proud of him and its a sunny day ❤️"
happy,"Stop living in your head and start living your truth. No one is worthy of judging you. We live on earth for such a short time. You want to spend it sad, stressed, and with anxiety? Fuck that!"
happy,"My boyfriend and I were cuddling yesterday and he told me he wants to be the father of my kids one day. I’ve always wanted a loving and respectful man who would want something long-term with me and I also aspire to be a mother who raises a cute lil family of my own one day, so I was squealing on the inside when he told me this :) I hope everyone and anyone can experience love as amazing as this if not better 🥰"
happy,"Each design is 100% hand-drawn by me using a digital tablet, a real artist that actually draws.

No gimmicks no Ai or any automated special effects – just skilled artistry that will capture every detail."
happy,"My boyfriend lives on the other side of the world, so we only get to see each other a handful of times each year. I arrived last night after a very long day of driving, flying, and layovers.

This is my second time seeing him in 2024, and we’ll get 2-3 more visits if we’re lucky.

Before I left, I googled concerts in the area, and my favorite band is playing nearby! I found out about the show completely by chance, and I’m so excited!

Currently sitting on his couch, crocheting a blanket for him, and he’ll be home in about 30 minutes (:

So grateful I get to see my favorite band live with my favorite person!!! Happy Thursday everyone"
happy,"everyday can be a chance to start over is the what i think about each day i wake up and get out of bed. i want to hear your story and what you either think, or do to stay happy and not let bad thoughts ruin the start of your day!"
happy,"I know it's not a huge deal but after a lot of research and taking my time I successful did a full brake job on my vehicle. I've been driving it for a week now and it's been a smooth ride, great braking and just overall really happy that I was able to complete it. In a way it really built some significant confidence for myself. I usually just do my own oil changes so this was a big step forward."
happy,"Hope my cat can brighten your day

My cat always brightens my day every day she brings a smile to my face , every day she brings a smile to my face

I hope this nice picture of her can also brighten your day. She is such a loving cat.

Hope you have all had a great day"
happy,"I've been pretty depressed for several month and I just started to get better. I've develloped a crush on a old schoolmate that is really beautiful and out of my league, but I'm not pessimistic of my chances.

We talk a little bit on instagram. Nothing more nothing less. It is nice even tho nothing is really happening.
I didn't saw her in real life for like 3 years. Only on social medias

This morning I took the Subway to go to work and I saw her in the train. God she was beautiful !
She left after just 4 stations but that was such a cool moment for me.
Nothing happened, but just the fact that I got the opportunity to see her in real life made that day a bit better :)"
happy,ALPACAS!!!!! (:
happy,"Apparently one night while I was extremely tired, I told him I really wanted a tiny spoon to eat with. He remembered and gave them to me a few days ago. Will forever use these things <3"
happy," I've been the happiest I've been for at least the past five years. No real complaints, no real worries. I mean, little day to day things like in a sitcom, but nothing crazy. I get up not worried about hating my job, don't think I have any real enemies, have a wonderful family and have the means to take care of them. Not religious either, so this is not fueled by my love for a higher being.

I found what makes me happy and don't really need anything else. Delighted to share my positive vibes if anyone needs some."
happy,Although not traditional it's supposed to be chicken paprikash with leftover checking and tagliatelle pasta thrown in 
happy,"My dad bought me a razer deathadder, and i already am seeing improvement."
happy," I got both a new laptop, and a PS5! I came into some money recently so I decided to treat myself. I needed a new laptop for school I just started at a university, and a PS5 so I can play the new Spiderman game! I have wanted a PS5 for nearly 3 years now, and it is finally mine. I also bought my textbooks for school as well. I still have a lot of money, but I will not go overboard. I will spend only what I need. I can buy lunch this week at school, and fix my bike but thats it. I need to open a savings account online and I will just put a bunch of it in there. "
happy,"It’s the little things sometimes. lol 
*no body shaming plse, i know im thick and im ok with it*"
happy,"Yesterday I received a personal email from a University I applied to that stated how impressed they were with it and how interested they are in my “eclectic interests”. They said they would love to talk to me in person or if I can’t do so via FaceTime! This was a huge confidence boost in my skills as a writer, I’m so happy!"
happy,"There was this local Mexican joint housed inside a run-down, little-used gas station. Classic ""hole in the wall"" type setup, which should have been this community's first clue that the food would be stupendous. They had these chorizo burritos with spicy sauce that just spoke to me on some metaphysical level.

Unfortunately, last summer they announced they were shutting down. They just weren't making enough money. I was despondent -- nothing else in this two-horse town even came close to approximating the culinary excellence this place provided.

They reopened yesterday. I was finally able to get in there today, and I swear to you that the clouds parted and angels sang as I took my first bite. It's every bit as good as I remembered.

I'm recommending them to everybody I know and hoping they manage to hold on this time."
happy,"First there's A, she's been my number one bestie since we were 7! Me and her get together to watch bullshit reality TV and talk major shit about the men. She loves videogames and she 100% completed breath of the wild and working her way through the new one. She loves her younger brother and takes him on as many vacations as she can. She puts together the most perfect for you, beautiful thoughtful gifts which she presents for you artfully. She has a talent at art and also interior design and her place is stylishly decorated and immaculately clean. Her passion lies in the Library though and she's almost finished with her masters in library science while working full time as a receptionist but soon she'll be a librarian. She's also super fucking funny. When we get together it's allllways laughing.

Then there's B, she's only like a genius scientist and professor with a perfect SAT score who just landed a job at NASA working from home. ALSO she runs marathons even though she got long COVID and has heart problems now. Her goal is still to run in every state and she's still working her way through it. She also skiis, roller skates, rock climbs, and has completed iron man triathlons. On top of that she can also draw and recently she made her own stickers of famous rock formations (shes a geologist). She's the most emotionally intelligent human I know and crafts everything she says with the most delicate tactful gentle thoughtfulness without sugarcoating anything and tells you things to challenge your ideas and potentially harmful or toxic thought processes. She is also a good baker and sends me cookies in the mail a lot!

Then there's C, he's probably the most interesting dude I know although it took him two years of talking to me every day to actually open up about the history of his life. He's been to jail a few times for various things and he told me all about the people there and most of them were ok guys who just ran amock and got themselves in trouble (except for theives who were all around no good people) he's been a chef in fancy restaurants but he is keen on languages and very knowledgeable about them particularly those from the middle east. He originally wanted to be an academic until life took a turn. When he was younger he did martial arts, tended to carnivorous plants, was part of the orchid society, and went out into the wilderness to hunt rocks a lot. He got into bad accidents and was badly injured so now he can't really do the stuff he used to love. It makes me sad. But he's super funny in the most imaginative quirky way. And no one has ever made me laugh in quite the same way.

Then there's well, the other C. He's a young thing. He's a bright person with a promising future. He's in medical school studying to be a surgeon and he's recently gotten his masters degree in the top of his class. He loves videogames and he's quiet, reserved, values manners but he's not afraid of dancing. He loves a good party and night out. When I went to the uk and visited him, he showed me some of the castles in Wales of which he is very proud. He has a strong sense of patriotism about being Welsh. He is the most different from me of all of my friends from two totally different upbringings and worlds but somehow we never run out of things to talk about. When I get in my dramatic moods, He has a way of saying just the perfect matter of fact thing to drop me down to earth and I laugh as I fall. He is a complete nerd to the core but he has a little bit of a charming cockiness and confidence that makes me love the hell out of him.

I have a bunch more friends but if I told you about them all then this would be insanely long! So I just talk about the closest ones. "
happy,"So I’ve been wanting to be more like my awesome marathon runner Papa. He’s always been a wonderful athlete! Running marathons when he was younger to playing softball now, in his 80’s. He’s the coolest guy, I’m dying to be more like him. Not just physically but emotionally too. He’s always been so chill. 

I set a goal to try to walk five miles every other day just to start, and to my surprise I’ve actually gone and done it! Pokémon GO tracks the duration of my walks and I’ve walked more than thirty miles each week for the past three weeks. I’m over the moon! 🐮 Just wanted to share some happy news. I hope you all have a nice day today!

happy,"Today my mom called me and asked if I wanted some framed photographs my grandfather made. Immediately I said yes. My grandpa is going on 84 however growing up him and my grandma had a huge hand in raising me, my brother and two of my younger cousins one of which I actually got an invite to his wedding in the summer. I looked at the photography and it's absolutely beautiful and he took in one of my favorite vacation spots. tawas Michigan. So double meaningful. I'm very happy to have this in my home. Honored really. And when he does eventually go I'll have something very nice to remember him with."
happy,"When we were kids, our immediate family was pretty low-income. So when we were visiting, our grandpa would often take a few of the grandkids to “grab coffee” from a well known donut shop. We’d get there and he’d say to the employees, “A black coffee and a whatever these guys want.” 

My brother and I would have mere seconds to select a single donut from the wall of deliciousness, and I often would feel overwhelmed with choice in the moment. We loved going to “grab coffee” with grandpa. 

Fast-forward about 25 years or so, and my brother and I live far from our hometown in different states. I text him and he absolutely remembered getting donuts with Grandpa, so with a bit of planning, we roped a friend of mine in who still lives in the old stomping grounds. 

This morning, I called my grandpa, then added my brother to the call. Grandpa is 87, and had to put us on speakerphone because one of his hearing aids needed to be charged. We chat to him for a moment, then my friend (and his mom, who used to go to church with my grandpa) rolls up with a box of donuts and a black coffee. 

Grandpa was surprised and a little confused at first, but was delighted that we remembered his coffee after all these years. Then he hung up on us (most of his phone calls don’t last more than 60 seconds) so he could chat to my friend and his mom. 

Honestly, it was such a delight to organize something unexpected for such a generous and caring gentleman who had such an impact on me and my brother. 

TL/DR grandpa used to take us to get donuts so we had donuts delivered to him even though we live far away."
happy,I've never experienced love like this before. I'm actually happy now ☺️
happy,I felt so happy to see nature and these ducks. 
happy,"Posted my cat cause I didn't wanna out a picture of my new niece but I'm so happy! Things are truly looking up right now! 😁 Don't be afraid of job interviews like I am and push through it! It's so worth it and I have ppl around me cheering me on, feels amazing!"
happy,"Might not seem like a big accomplishment to a lot of people, but as someone who’s been constantly biting their nails until they bleed since like 6 years old (I’m now 16), this is a big accomplishment for me!! 

I used to bite them a lot when I was nervous, after panic attacks or after breakdowns, but for the last two weeks I haven’t had any urges to! My nails are finally long enough that I can paint them and they’re also the longest they’ve been in years! 

They might not be super long but to me they are! I’m hoping to let them grow longer and learn to do more nail art and stuff with them!"
happy,"Husband had to work in Kinross, but stayed in St Ignace. Someday we'll make it up to Mackinac in the Summer, but for now I can have the fudge! The kids each got chocolate, I have Turtle, Sea salt and caramel, and chocolate peanut butter."
happy,"If a genie or another supernatural being approached me when I was 10 years old and asked me for three wishes, I would definitely ask for the following: 

* to find true love (I was a very romantic kid, haha)
*  to become a teacher
*  and to make video games. 

It took a long time, but finally, at the age of 30, I met the most wonderful woman ever, and she miraculously fell in love with me too. That happened in 2016. 

For various reasons, I had started and quit my studies multiple times. However, in 2020, I was finally able to teach my first class in high school! Yes, it was the year of the pandemic, and it was challenging, but I loved it and it has become my profession. 

In January of this year (2023), I decided that it was time to seriously pursue making video games. In November, I released my first game! It was an amazing experience, to the point that game development has become my number one hobby. 

I don't know what the future holds, what 2024 will bring for me or for anyone reading this, but I hope we all continue to pursue our wishes, and maybe even reach them. Happy new year!"
happy,Soooo satisfying
happy,So what small things brings you joy or makes you happy? 
happy,"I’ve done an emotional 180 over the past two years for the better! These books have helped me more than therapy, antidepressants, and sleeping pills. Some of them contain spirituality but can be enjoyed by any religion. I tell everyone I know about them and just wanted to share here!"
happy,"Man oh MAN!!! First off, im absolutely fucking ZOOTED off a 5mg candy. 2nd today was so freakin FUN! Long story short, i have been sober but a 5 year streak of Alcoholism. I slowed down to only on special occasions starting on my birthday (July 31) of last year, only drank christmas, thanksgiving, and once a week before christmas because i had found out my dad needed heart bypass surgery, last try out drink was a shot in February of this year and i have not drank SHIT since. Anyways, today i took my brother to the dispensary. It was his first time and i said it was on me. I got home and i felt so good i just wanted to share. 

Ive always wanted to cross of my bucket list have a first experience with one of my siblings. I know thats a odd experience but the way my brother was excited to go with me was so filling. It was just the fact that we got to enjoy a shared interest. although i do not condone drug use if it is illegal in your state, like i said, sharing a similar interest together was great. He even said “Next time i get paid, it’s on me.” 

Today was great. I feel so whole again. My heart feels so light for the first time in years and im just so excited to enjoy more things in life after feeling so low for such a long time. 
"
happy,"I just got back from a trip to Idaho for my nieces high school graduation. I had casually kept a good relationship over text with my niece ever since she moved from Southern California to Texas to Idaho in less than a few months. I knew she was going through a lot emotionally and with college coming up it was stressful. I remember how I was at that age (I graduated 2003 and also switched high schools my sr year).

Come graduation day we're in the gymnasium and all the families are still kinda getting seated. I can see all the chairs for the seniors to sit on, I see all the administration on stage and the band in the back playing some songs. Then I see some of her family on her moms side get super excited and I look down to my right to see what the commotion's about. It's a sash that said ""Valedictorian"".

What?! Not only was my niece Valedictorian of her class, she absolutely CRUSHED it. She's already a full year ahead into her college coursework, passed every AP exam she took, played Bass Clarinet through school, did Softball and went to State Championships. She's like a superhuman.

I don't have any kids of my own, but the amount of pride I feel for her is immense. To top it all off she got a full ride to the University of Idaho and she plans on studying Neuroscience (you know, easy stuff). And she's still highly critical of herself and self analyses a ton looking for any way to be better in almost anything she does. The coolest thing I ever did was play video games professionally on a stage - this girl's about to solve complex brain problems as a hobby.

As a reward for all her hard work I made her a promise - a thing I never do because I hate making promises as I hate even the idea of not being able to keep one. I promised her if she graduated with a 4 year degree (not even necessarily in neuroscience, I gave her that leeway) that I'd personally pay for and accompany her on a trip to Japan. And since she's worked so hard in high school she's already got a year head start. I now have 3 years to save up for a Japan trip. Worst Best promise ever."
happy,"I work by myself in animal rescue in a place where abandoned animals is pretty common. After my money goes into them and my own groceries, I often have next to nothing to spend on myself. For the last year and a half, I was sleeping on an old donated sofa bed in the main room. But my birthday was last month, and some friends chipped in to buy me the mattress, bed frame, and even new pillows and bedsheets! I did end up building it myself, which took the whole month because I had to find time between running around doing animal stuff, so it feels like my accomplishment too. I just feel so proud of myself and so happy and lucky to have great friends.
"
happy,"He moved around to get comfy and he laid his head on my hand like a pillow and he always comes to comfort me whenever I don’t feel well, I love him"
happy,"I love people. I find it so fascinating how incredibly intricate every single person is, and there’s billions of us! I genuinely love seeing people walking outside or at school. I’m excited to see my friends, yes, but I also love the fact that I get to see everyone else’s faces every day. I’ve never really empathized with those that say they hate the majority of people. I get being hurt and losing the ability to trust, I can understand it, but I don’t think I could really just hate people in general. I love people’s faces, not just the eyes, but the noses and the smiles and the way skin crinkles. I get so excited at the prospect of meeting new people, because that’s one more entire life I get to interact with! That person an entire world of inner thought and experiences that is allowing me to take part in their experience of the world. Idk I just really love people a whole lot."
happy,"Just wanted to share this small victory, since im feeling hella good abt it.  
I tried to filter a dataframe for certain items, but it always gave me the code ""undefined columns selected"". I couldn´t solve it for literal DAYS and it really frustrated me to the point of crying.

  
Turns out i just forgot that the items had a headline in the program! So no wonder i defined them wrongly! I forgot that i didn´t turn off the headline while importing the dataset, and that´s why it always gave me that error!

  
I know i´m not a genius, but i feel absolutely undefeatable right now.

Thanks for reading my small vent :)"
happy,"Just the sunlight dancing off the water,
And the weight of his arm around her shoulders."
happy,"Hi everyone!

So my girlfriend and I (both women <3 if that's an issue for you, please just don't interact with this post) started dating at the end of January this year. This was after my ex-boyfriend and I broke up a few weeks before (we were together 4 years but it had been over a year that it wasn't working out. I don't want comments on this, you'll understand why later).

I have a lot of anxiety around relationships. My ex verbally abused me for the first part of our relationship, and then he was never physically there because he had to stay back home for understandable reasons. I was unhappy. I did things that hurt him too, and I've looked into why I did what I did and am learning to overcome what happened between us (the things he used to say to me in anger outbursts).

Now I've been friends with my girlfriend for 3 ish years now. I always thought she was so gorgeous and funny. I got to spending more time with her and next thing I knew, I was falling in love. I don't know what I did to get so lucky. Whenever I come forward about my feelings about something, she NEVER gets mad at me. She's so calm, so chill. She reassures me gently, and listens to me while explaining to me why this is okay, that I am valid. When I'm down for whatever reason, she makes me laugh without a problem. I can do anything with her and we can make it fun! I laugh harder with her than anyone else. She engages in things that I like and genuinely enjoys them, and vice versa.

The other day, we were snuggling and chatting in bed. I don't remember what she said, but it really hit home and I just felt my eyes start to water. She asked me what was wrong, and I just looked at her and said ""I just realized how unsafe I felt in the world before you"". She smiled and pulled me in, she let me cry on her for a few seconds.

She lets me talk about my ex and what happened. She knows I'm far from romantically or sexually interested in him anymore. She's so kind about the fact that I do miss him sometimes as a friend (I mean, 4 years with someone and talking almost every day is hard to let go of). I don't think about it often, really. She lets me talk about the things he did/said to me that hurt me deeply. I mean even yesterday we were talking about some of the horrible things he said and she looked at me and said ""I want to show you what a soft love looks like."" I just stared at her in awe and shock. I was frozen in place, just...speechless. She makes it safe for me to express excitement about things I love, she doesn't judge me for the things I enjoy, and SHE DOESN'T GET MAD AT ME!!! She doesn't insult me beyond what we both agree are jokes, she gently redirects me towards healthier behaviors for my mental health and for the relationship, we're both working together to be healthy and I just...wow....She's even coming home with me for Easter weekend (we don't celebrate but hey, why not).

I'm beyond happy with her. Maybe it's too soon to tell, I don't know, but I want to marry her someday. I really think this is it, that she's my future wife. She's currently asleep in my bed. I want her to be my love for the rest of our lives. She is truly and unequivocally the most beautiful person I've ever met (inside and out). I can't see a day where I don't find her funny anymore, where I don't find her attractive anymore, where I don't want to run to her to tell her about my day. I want to share my world with her. She's my best friend and more. I've never been happier, and I've never felt more like me.

If you read this whole thing, thank you so much :) I know it's a lot, it's messy, and honestly I can't even say everything I feel about this woman because I just don't have the words to express the deep, honest love I have for her. I wish you all the most WONDERFUL day!"
happy,"my online friend from a different country visited for her birthday and invited me to disneyland! i have never gone before in my life! i was really taken aback by her offer too. she bought my ticket, for her bday celebration trip? 😭😭😭

she made it possible that me and my partner could actually afford to go and meet her there. 🥺🥺🥺

i brought her a gift related to her one of her special interest, it was something she said she wanted too, so it was perfect and she was so happy. she also gifted me a plush, which is my special interest! i will cherish this plush forever. 

my partner and i spent the whole day with her and it was amazing. i have no irl friends, only online as it is what i prefer. i find like-minded individuals with the same interests! we are also both diagnosed with ASD, and we really clicked as friends in real life as we do online! ☺️ it was just the same! 

she is going back to her home country tomorrow and that’s bittersweet, but the memories we made today were priceless!

this is the first online friend i’ve ever met in person before too. she is such a sweet friend! my partner really enjoyed hanging out with her too! 

had to gush about my day, as it’s the best i’ve had in a very long time. maybe ever."

happy,"I shouldn’t be writing this since I’m about to go to bed

  
But sitting at my work desk I was feeling a little stressed about life

  
But something made it all go away

  
I closed my eyes… and starting imagining

  
Imaging my future

  
A future where I’m with my future daughter and I’m pushing her on a swing

  
She’s smiling so much and laughing and calling me daddy.

  
\-you can make it weird, but honestly it was super cute

  
I could clearly see her face so happy

  
Then another time

  
We’re at the beach and she’s older, a teenager

  
And the next scene I’m on my death bed with 5-7 kids around me

  
I’m smiling and they’re crying

  
In the present, the me who is sitting at my work desk is also smiling befause I’ve realised

  
There is no reason to be stressed

  
Thjngs can’t be bad forever, they never are, the only way to make it out of a stressful situation is to keep going and having hope.

  
Key lesson: start doing positive future visualisations when you’re lost.

  
They’ll change your life  
I hope this post is valuable to anyone feeling lost.  
Let me know what you think. What do you guys like to visualise, or think about, which makes you happy? :)"

happy,"I was finishing some work, and I realized, while listening to a Gilmore Girls analysis video, that I have genuinely not felt suicidal in a couple of days! I've been going to school in the afternoon for the past week, leaving the mornings to myself, and I can see that my mood has been somewhat better! I unfortunately have to go to school tomorrow morning, but for what its worth, I've not been entirely suicidal lately!"
happy,Me and my wife have been together 20 years in October and married 16 in November. As long as I've known her she's been a smoker. I was a smoker myself. I finally kicked the habit three years ago. Bur my wife has been incredibly stubborn on the subject. Today we talked for a while and she decided to take steps to quit. I couldn't be happier with this decision. I'm aware that this will not he easy but she's at least willing. And I'm gonna stand by her and take all the crap that comes with quitting. If it means she can improve her health and I can have her longer I am more than willing to be her punching bag for a few weeks. I'm very proud because she really didn't want to do this. 
happy,"So, as the title says, I started driving today. It was a motorcycle, no less. For some context, I'm 26 and never been in the driver's seat.

I've had Daisy (name of my bike) about as long as I've had a motorcycle license - about a year - but I haven't been able to put her on the road for various reasons, the funniest of which being the government and insurance companies typically don't like it when your 500lb death rocket was purchased with a lawn mower battery installed.

That's not all of it. Daisy needed a lot of work. But she finally met all the requirements to be put on the road just this morning, and I rode all day today. Let me tell you, it was worth every drop of sweat, every frustrated cuss, and of course every penny.

I knew driving would be fun, but I never could've predicted the extent of such. I was so calm just driving around my neighborhood. Everything could go wrong, and I knew it. But I didn't care. If it happens, I'll handle it like I was taught. All I could feel was joy."
happy,"Basically the title but my mum recently bought us tickets to see Hozier when he comes to Australia and she’s now teaching herself the lyrics to all his songs so she can sing along, what makes this better is that English is not her first language and she keeps asking me what some words mean so she can fully understand what his songs are about."
happy,"This was filmed at their album release party this past January. I think it rocks and wanted to share. They’re on Spotify and are already ready for a second album this summer. Really happy for him, he’s the guitarist in the cowboy hat and wrote this instrumental!"
happy,Let’s go weekend !!
happy,"Growing up I was always in special education classes and have a real hard time learning. I was addicted to meth for 16 years and have been sober for 14. I started working at a treatment center in the kitchen, and never thought that I would ever have my own office able to help people struggling with substances. The thought of passing this test was so far-fetched. Anyway, on the 31st I passed my test and feel about 2 inches taller. And for somebody of my stature that’s a big deal lol I have been happy dancing all week. Now I have a career that I can provide for my 15-year-old son. Which I got full custody of when I was five years sober. Life is so good. If you’re struggling but doing the right thing, keep it up it pays off."
happy,"It's been some time since we have time to go out on our own, she realized that the zoo give her a free ticket fkr her b-day, so we said ""why not?"""
happy,"It’s actually not fair how hot, smart and good at League of legends I am. Even this ugly yeeyeeass sir Isaac newton haircut isn’t enough to nerf me. I need to give my parents a trophy for best chefs of 2002 CAUSE THEY WERE COOKING 
"
happy,"Throughout my life I have dealt with a series of health problems and that caused me to be very lethargic. Been to hospital and so on many times. Mainly stuff with my ovaries, kidneys, and liver.  

One thing that made me upset a bit was when I was 17 and attempted to donate blood, but was just not able to due to my condition and problems in general.

Today after dealing with going to the doctors pretty much once a month last year I was finally eligible to donate and so I signed up and did so. 

Happened only a few hours ago and I feel great! Before when I used to get blood drawn for example for medical reasons I would get very nauseous and faint just due to how my health was. Feels strange not feeling that way despite the donation being more blood."
happy,I hope it does the same for you!
happy,"
He is the strongest man I have ever met, I admire and look up to him more than he knows. We passed our one year recently and my love for him still grows day by day. The world seems so colorful with meaning falling out of every single fold and crevice. Everything has meaning. Every little bug exists at the same time as we do. As incoherent as it is, I even find joy in realizing we both have eyes to look at the same things together. We are under the same sky. Somehow these axioms of the human experience feel much more meaningful because he’s alive with me. If I had killed myself when I was 17 I would have never known he was out there in this very world that I am in. Living his little 17 year old life, experiencing things that would make him the man he is today. I sometimes wish we would have met as babies. I would’ve loved him when we were 10, 15, 20, just as much as I love him at 24. I think that’s what love is.
"
happy,"My bucket list is filled with things like running with the bulls, paragliding from the summit of Mt. Blanc and climbing Mach Piccu, many things I won’t likely get around to, leaving my bucket unsatisfyingly shallow. 
My anti-bucket list has simpler and more achievable goals like removing unhealthy eating habits, avoiding overcommitting myself and purging toxic people and negative influences.
This bucket is filling up much faster and I’m finding longer term happiness rather than short term excitement. "
happy,"It feels so euphorically good to be in love with my best friend. Have I laughed? Constantly, daily, hourly. Have I cried? Yes, tears of joy. We play video games, sometimes I watch him play, sometimes he watches me, but when we play together we always have each others backs! We go on long walks, at night, with our dog, to the beach, to different cities or exploring shops and attractions. We leave each other love notes, poetry, words of encouragement. We workout and hold each other accountable, cook meals together. We love each other’s families and feel comfortable and accepted. We have spa days together, face masks, bubble bath, scrubs, moisturizer and massages. When either of us feels sad we listen with true understanding and openness, thoughtful advice and write out plans to strengthen our resolve. We dance together, in our home, in the grocery store, with our dog or anywhere we feel like. I’ve never been so in love, at peace, accepted,  empowered and confident. I am finally happy. "
happy,"The first woman I ever fell in love with was simply a victim of circumstances at the time.  Despite my maturity and the intensity of our bond, we were four years apart during a time that just wouldn't have been fair for us to continue.

A failed marriage and one child each later, she called me out of the blue.  I'm barely 6 months removed from the end of an 8 year marriage.  I thought about calling this woman weeks after it ended, but it wouldn't have been fair.  She and I deserve the time and space to explore our relationship without the cloud of my divorce hanging over it.

Last monday when I was out of town, she called me on a whim.  The universe told her to so loudly that she stopped what she was doing to reach out.  She had no idea of my circumstance (unless she's lying, which is way out of her character).  When her name popped up on my phone, my belly fell straight through my ass and every hair and goosebump on my body sprang to attention.

We've texted and talked every day since.  Like teenagers.  It's amazing.  Each of our kids got sick the day I got back from my business trip.  Twice our plans to reconnect physically have been delayed by the universe.  I am still on cloud 9.  I don't know where it's heading, aside from unbelievable sex. I do know that the connection that her and I have maintained through the years, despite the distance and separation, is unlike anything I've shared with anyone before.  

I'm terrified of how quickly our energy reconnected. Having had a week and two cancelled meetings to build the tension and bond through words and phone calls has been insanely hot.  I haven't been this happy, though, since a year before my marriage ended, at least.  

In the end I just needed to put this into the world.  Of the thousands of emotions I'm dealing with through this, happiness and hope are the two strongest.  I hope that whatever the next days and weeks bring, that I can maintain the feeling of positivity that she's brought into my heart."
happy,It's Spring! I am so happy when I hear the birds and frogs on my walk to work.
happy,"Hi Reddit! I’ve been trying to use my account as an outlet to manage my feelings and healing. I am so excited to share that I was finally able to mow my lawn, rake my leaves, and plant a few seeds in my yard today! Some backstory (trigger warning: SA), I was sexually assaulted by a man that lived on my street, and for the longest time, I was nervous to work on my yard in my front lawn because I did not want to see him. But, he finally moved out. I was so excited to see the moving truck near his house. I don’t have to hire a lawn crew anymore and I don’t have to take the long route walking to try and avoid this person. I am very excited and happy. I haven’t done my own yard work for a long time and I feel very good. 🥰"
happy,I just feel so much better now that I've learned to cope with all of my mental health issues and even though is not perfect I just feel so proud of myself :))
happy,"(Just to preface this, it happened yesterday, and I wrote it yesterday, so it’s in present tense, but happened yesterday)

So I have a lot of very noticeable self harm scars on my legs. Especially my right thigh. They’re basically all over, and pretty close to my knees. If I wear shorts, they’re extremely visible. Today, it was 85 degrees, and I also am in track and field.

I was super super nervous about wearing shorts to school today, because it’d really be the first time anyone would have seen my scars, and I was just freaking out. The day had gone pretty good, 2 girls asked me what happened to my leg, I just said “it’s not important” and they left it at that.

Then, at the end of track practice, a guy a couple grades older than me comes up to me, and says “hey, amazing-flute-piano, are those scars?” As he gestures towards his own leg. Internally, I’m dying. Like I’m soooo nervous for what he’s about to say.

I just say “yea, they are”. Then he says “I think you’re so incredibly brave for wearing shorts. That takes a lot of courage.” And I just thanked him.

I also smiled. I did more than smile. I cried. I started crying from the sheer gratefulness and gratitude I felt. I started crying because I never expected those words to come out of anyone’s mouth, let alone another high schoolers. I started crying because that meant so much to me. It made me feel so happy. It truly did. It made me feel like I wasn’t alone, and that not everyone will judge me. It made me feel proud, and not ashamed.

Tomorrow, I have a class with him, and I’m going to make sure that I thank him again, because he deserves it. 🤍"
happy,"I (31F) dropped out of school more times than I can remember I finished undergrad last year and found a master program that was tailored to exactly what I want to a T. I applied to this school twice in undergrad and got rejected. This has been the school of my dreams since I was a child, I grew up around it, supported the teams since I was a kid and always drove by it wanted to go to it. I got the acceptance letter today and started crying. Everything that has happened to me has lead to this point. The happiest moment of my life, if I can talk to my younger self who never believed she could end up here I would hug her. I can’t wait for this next step in my life."
happy,"Made me happy, They seem happy. I'm filming the wild monkeys that frequent my garden and was surprised with how quickly doing this brought joy to my life...only thing is I am a bit attached now.

happy,I’m 44. Never thought I’d have kids. Today that changed. Say hi to Annie.
happy,I was in a bowling league for 4 years up until 2020 and they had to end the league due to covid. I got super unmotivated about everything and I didn't rejoin when it opened. For Christmas I asked for a new bowling ball because I want to play in a league again. I got my ball but leagues aren't available yet so I've been practicing on my own. I'm already better than I used to be and more consistent. My previous record was a 217 from 2019. Last night I bowled a 213 and then a 224. I'm gonna light up the league 😊
happy,"I know I know; every community has it's toxic weeds that grow.

But so far my experience on Reddit has been like a walk in the park, and I'm just happy to read so many well written, sad, happy, funny, thought provoking, and interesting  posts/stories!

I always heard Reddit getting made fun of for the most part (and for good reason at times well deserved ofc) and even heavily bashed or told it was a ""cesspool of nasty to absolutely stay away from"".

 I stayed away for a long time, like the plague indeed, but I thought, ""Why not personally give it a shot,"" and see what happens, eh?

Never been a big social media person anyway since I'm not the best at being social, writing, taking pics, or navigating around strangers, so I'm beyond impressed so far with the community and am just happy my experience thus far has been good. :) 

And I'm just giddy to see what great, terrible, hilarious, irksome, and strange posts are yet to come.
Not to be sappy, I'm just happy to enjoy something new and am trying to find happy things to experience, especially with how lucky I am to be alive now.

Simple pleasures are my go to and I'm just getting older and more years are silently passing by. 
And I'm learning how to be a better writer thanks to y'all! I haven't written since high school, and am falling in love all over again with this hobby. 

I haven't seen such good writing, interesting stories, or funny jokes in ages. Impressed and can't wait to be more impressed and, somehow, even let down someday 😅if that even is something to look forward to."
happy,"My two kids from a previous marriage now have mom, dad, AND papà. They looked so happy during our little ceremony; even my generally stone-faced teenager couldn't help but smile. Husband's parents served as our witnesses, and we had a lovely day together. We also have our honeymoon to Japan in a few weeks, which I'm beyond thrilled about. More than anything, I feel gratitude. For an amazing, intelligent, and funny partner, and for the wonderful and loving papà my kids have gained over the last few years. My life has gone from the very dark place I was born into to this...it feels like a fairytale. I have my partner, my babies (shared time with their dad, but for several months at a time which is great for us with school,) and then university finally, and just generally life is stable and good. I didn't know where else to share but I'm just really happy. :)

Edit: To clarify, we met on reddit 🥰"
happy,"A while ago I wanted to download a game from my childhood because I remember really liking the music. I'm waaay too old for anything in it of course and don't have kids but I wrote a review baisicly saying that it made my childhood and that even though I've grown out of it I still adore it. I checked today and found out that the creator of the game wrote back a review saying ""We were so pleased! We are extremely glad that we brought happiness to your childhood! This is our goal! Thank you very much for these words on behalf of the whole team! Be healthy!"" (Translated from bulgarian). Actually crying tears of joy this was so sweet."
happy,I was super anxious about those tests because I was not doing well in the class and I thought I may fail few classes but im happy that I pass with A +.. this has been a crazy semester
happy,We had a long and semi mild winter but with the freezes and thaws it's taken my garden to bloom any flowers. These daffodils are usually also eaten or picked by my children so this has been so nice to enjoy their beautiful blooms.
happy,"I've struggled in the dating arena for years, only managing to get one or two first dates, from the apps. Last year, I realized I was asexual, and tried a dating site for asexuals. I started chatting with someone on there, and just met in person, and we really hit it off. "
happy,I’m so happy with myself
happy,"I think I may have perfected my winged liner on slightly hooded eyes! And I tried out a purple liner which makes my brown eyes pop, especially the hazel and green flecks. Just super excited about it and wanted to share!"
happy,"This is so weird , but a few days ago my boyfriend and I went into a little no-contact stage after a small argument we had over something petty . 

It wasn’t specific or anything but we both just stopped reaching out and got busy . 


Well yesterday after like 2 days of no contact , I go to message him on instagram and the second my message delivered, I received a message from him on text message 😂 

We literally messaged each other at the exact same moment after 2 days and were thinking of each other exactly at the same moment 

So adorable haha "
happy,"I probably found a friend for life

We know eachother for 6 years, even though we didn't meet irl as he's to far from my city, we trust eachother more than anyone we have. He saved me from un-aliving myself multiple times and he didn't even know about it. Tonight we were just talking, he went into a topic of my mental health and then we both thanked eachother for helping ourselves. I'm glad he exists and if I didn't play that one league game I wouldn't be here right now.


Edit: Did I?
"
happy,"The day me and this cutie met irl, we were supposed to go on our first date. Instead, I totalled my car 2 hours from home and 2 hours away from him (I'm ok!). He drove all the way to get me from the tow shop, drove to my hotel and stayed with me so I wouldn't be suffering alone because lawd I was some pain from being jarred so hard! Despite the dramatic start, our second date weekend was amazing! We went to a festival, watched Tenacious D's Pick of Destiny, I introduced him to Puerto Rican food and culture, and best of all, he met my grandma and she loves him! I am so happy, sooooo happy! I feel so lucky. :)"
happy,I’m so happy with myself
happy,"I was being intimate with a white guy and I’m an awkward person so I said I had “hair extensions” and he didn’t mind. He didn’t care at all. He treated me like a normal person… he even touched my head gently a couple of times which made my hairstyle a bit messy but nothing bad happened.

I’m young and the reason I wear wigs is I don’t want to hear damage my real hair :3"
happy,"Title seems conceited, I know, but I have been with fever the past few days and I just forced myself to go out so my brother will have company on the long lines at the cashier.

You see, I like dressing up a lot and I still did it earlier. I tucked a red sweatshirt on a pink skirt and matched it with my pink heels and bag.

At the grocery store, a promoter of something asked me to take a picture with them, and I did! I was genuinely happy about that because someone noticed my style.

We went to another mall because the first store was a bit lacking. While I was looking for food containers to put my desserts in, a saleslady complimented my heels!

I am elated and inspired to go out wearing what I want now! ❤️❤️❤️"
happy,I (F18) talked to the army three months ago about joining just for the fun of it. I had no idea that I could get trained as an LPN. (I want to be a doctor one day so this will get me started in building my career) I signed my contract at MEPs yesterday. I'm really excited to be able to go to college and be able to move out of my parent's house!! 
happy,Very damn well pleased with myself.
happy,"[unrelated image]
Hi, i just got in high school last week and I didn't know anyone except for a friend of mine that ended up on the same school as me. A friend of her  also ended up there (wich i didn't know until yesterday). I just think it's worth to say that my social skills are terrible (expected from a reddit user lol), and i just find so difficult to start conversations, meeting people and stuff like that. On the first week i was dead silent, didn't talk to anyone, i was too shy and embarrassed, and felt like i would be a inconvenience to anyone just trying to stay in peace. Then yesterday (second week already), that friend of mine and her friend were talking to each other and they came to my desk to say something, and just stayed there for the rest of the lunch break, and we talked for a while until the class resumed. But today was even cooler, some of the teachers didn't show up on class, and we just talked the entire time about our lives. And believe it or not, it gets even cooler: we live in the same region, so we get the same buses on our way to home, and guess what: we talked the entire way lol. It just feels so nice to have someone to talk with that isn't on the internet, i was really missing that in-person social interactions haha.
Anyway, i think I've never typed so much in english, I hope only the best for y'all, cya ;P"
happy,"I went to bed sad and preoccupied, I woke up groggy and then... 

Then I went to see my freshly repoted baby tomatoes, some of them grew a third cute leaf when I thought I fucked it all up ! New leaves on my plants (I'm a young plant parent, 20 plants besides the vegetables) give me hope, it's like starting anew, being reborn... 

What is the thing that made You smile today?"
happy,"For 24 years I've worked to grow my business.  As a single parent it has been tough.  I missed many precious moments with my daughter and I've always regretted it.  My company has been my second greatest accomplishment next to my daughter.  I'm truly happy to sell it today because I'm selling it to the employees who have done so much to make it great.

I never thought this day would come and it's been an emotional rollercoaster for the last four years. I feared what retirement would mean.  I had an identity crisis coming to terms with not being the boss.  I feared boredom but the pandemic has taught me that I don't need my business.  Connection to my family and hobbies are more than enough to provide fulfillment.

I had a hard time with selling, I built this company and it's a reflection of me.  I've had plenty of offers from larger firms but I don't want to think what would have happened to my company, my employees and it's reputation if some huge conglomerate absorbed it.

It's taken years and I am not getting as much as I could if I sold to a competitor but I'm selling to people who I know will continue the company with the same standards I built it with.  I'm selling to the employees who are the ones that made it all possible. I also know I'm the only one who will be out of a job from this.

It took 4 years to let go and today I finally signed. In a few more months I'll walk away, happily. I have many years left to spend with my family, travel, enjoy my farm, and my horses. I'm truly thankful for the last 24 years and everyone who has made this moment possible.
"
happy,"Not only was I drinking out of despair for my unfortunate life, but I was making my life more unfortunate with drinking. I was depressed. Couldn’t hold a job. Was in debt. Unhealthy life habits and terribly unhealthy, both physically and mentally. Had toxic friendships and relationships. Deep down I hated myself and thought it was the life I deserved, and I couldn’t ever live a happy life. 9 months ago I decided to change that. My whole life has turned around! I’ve lost weight, am finally experiencing true happiness, have a wonderful partner and meaningful relationships, am constantly working on making my self and life better, and may even be able to retire before I hit 30.  Oh, and I am nearly 3 months sober of weed as well!!!!

Today is such a good day. "
happy,i look good and i feel good - hiking five miles every morning has been glorious and the views here are chefs kiss! just wanted to share that little slice of sunshine. :)
happy,"I'm big into the local music scene as a local musician, amateur gig photographer, and just general lover of grassroots music. For my birthday, my boyfriend secretly set-up a non-profit music promoter enterprise, booked four of my favourite local bands to play at a local grassroots venues on my birthday weekend, and arranged for all ticket sales to go to one of my favourite local charities! 

It's without a doubt the most thoughtful thing anyone has ever done for me, and I'm totally blown away by it!

happy,"Hey All - Just wanted to tell someone other than since I don’t really have any friends. 

Got the promotion at work I’ve been working towards for the last 11 months. Over 125 interviews (internal postings) and I got selected. Beat out very capable individuals, some with 5-7 years of seniority. 

Pretty damn happy. Giving my all each and every day, without exception, finally paid off for me, for once. 
"
happy,"I have always worked construction and trades jobs my whole life but a few years ago I took a leap and decided to do something with my creative side. It has always been my dream to work in a creative field as I’ve always loved art and design. So I’ve been going to university for graphic design for the past two years online. I’ve been working meaningless part time jobs in retail and maintenance to pay my bills while going to school. 

A little while ago my friend gave me a tip that his company was hiring and it’s in the industry. Long story short I beat the other applicants and was hired!!! I am now a layout editor for a media company. I specialize in newspaper page layouts. For the first time in my life I’m actually making a living wage and can afford to live normally. Nothing fancy but I’m doing more than just surviving now. I couldn’t be happier. Follow your dreams kids!!"
happy,"I posted something in this sub a little less than 6 months ago after being clean for 2 weeks (I deleted the post for unrelated reasons) and while I got a lot of support I also got a lot of crap because it was ""only two weeks, come back when you have actually achieved something"".  Well, [here I am](http://imgur.com/gallery/ZDd7cMS), 6 months later, still clean, recently engaged, just got into a computer programming program, and have never been happier.  I just resolved my legal issues last week, actually have a savings of more than $2K, am rebuilding relationships with my family members and have nothing but optimism and hope for the future I never bothered to think about before.

Just wanted to use today to send out a PSA to anyone struggling with addiction - it can and DOES get better.  I am here for anyone that needs support.

happy,"I've been sad for nearly 2 years after my best friend completely moved on from me after 13 years. I'm not longer angry or sad about it. 

I can't change it. She's happy now, and that's all I wish for her. I'm at peace with the whole situation at last. I'm happy knowing she's happy, and that we can still be friends, even if we're not as close. 

I think of our memories fondly, and not in sadness. And I feel so much more free, it's always been in the back of my mind since it happened, and when I first thought of her today I just felt alright. Life will do what it will. I absolutely can't wait to make new friends"
happy,"JNJDSB I know this might not sound like a big deal, but I've been so stressed about my storage because of how much I need for the software I want to install and because I can't convince my parents I need an additional drive because I own a lot of usbs already. But my usb with the largest storage...IT WAS NOT WORKING. *FOR YEARS.*

And so just few minutes ago, I found out...*I can reformat it, even though all the data would be erased, it would hopefully work*....

That doesn't sound that great, ***right?*** SO I PLUGGED IN MY USB TO REFORMAT IT AND IT'S PERFECTLY FINE??????????????

My guess is that a while I ago I was troubleshooting drives, transferring files, running security software and whatnot, and around that time I repaired the drive, but just didn't notice it or forgot about it. 😭

BUT I AM SO HAPPY. LIKE SO GODDAMN HAPPY. It's 1:43 am, I'm so happy I considered waking up my parents and my siblings to tell them that it works. I am so so so so so incredibly happy.

Like, there's so much things that were being held back because of this stress, and now it's like ***FREEDOM.*** **And like things are finally looking forward. AND THERE'S SO MUCH MORE I CAN DO NOW!!! SO MUCH MORE TO TEST!!!! I AM SO EXCITED.**

happy,"I'm 28 years old. I graduated high school early and expectations were high for me even though I lived in a toxic sometimes abusive household. I worked in a restaurant to claw myself out of the gutter, and ended up with pretty severe addiction problems. Over 2 years ago I decided I wanted to break the cycle of mental illness and addiction in my family. I wanted to work on my mental health, but I knew that meant recovery. I went to treatment, found a form of therapy that worked for me and after 2 years of individual with a year of group therapy in there I have evolved! Not only did I get a day job that I love and feel valued at, but I also began school in January! My first term just ended, and I got A's in my two classes! And I got 100% in my favorite class of all time!! A good friend of mine went to some nice schools in the area but he's been beyond supportive throughout my journey so I texted him about school and that was his response. I'm so blessed. Good friends, just got a raise and more hours at my day job, we have partial custody over my step son, and I'm doing great mentally and emotionally on top of it all! IF I CAN DO IT YOU CAN DO IT TOO!

happy,"Now i don't live on this subreddit, however ima write a thing that kinda makes me smile right now

In my school we got a class called ""musical"", volentarily, where basically everyone that is in his last 2 grades helps performing a musical (11th grade \[second to last\] helps, 12th (last) on stage). My teacher is doing this job for 20 years already, so he knows what he has to do, and what will happen. HOWEVER we are his first premiere, the first one to perform the musical ""School Of Rock"" in our country (Germany).

We've began to practice a few weeks ago, we knew our singing parts more or less already, so it wasn't such a big deal. Now that we are on our final days it starts to hit us, that we will be standing for so many people, singing, shouting and dancing. And boy/girl you don't know how happy i am. It might be that i am going crazy again, but boyyy/guuuurlll i can't stop smiling, it's gonna be nexxt weeeeeeek :D

It's all fun, of course sometimes we don't agree with everything, but mostly we (I) have fun"
happy,"So I’ve been wanting to be more like my awesome marathon runner Papa. He’s always been a wonderful athlete! Running marathons when he was younger to playing softball now, in his 80’s. He’s the coolest guy, I’m dying to be more like him. Not just physically but emotionally too. He’s always been so chill. 

I set a goal to try to walk five miles every other day just to start, and to my surprise I’ve actually gone and done it! Pokémon GO tracks the duration of my walks and I’ve walked more than thirty miles each week for the past three weeks. I’m over the moon! 🐮 Just wanted to share some happy news. I hope you all have a nice day today!

happy,Started the year making better changes. Ive lost 19lbs in total since January.
happy,"Tomorrow marks one whole month of not purging or throwing up, and recovering from my second bout with bulimia!!"
happy,"I’m going with 2 of my close girl friends. I’ve done cruises with family before but I’ve never traveled as an adult, both in the US and internationally,  without family (parents) or husband. Now I’m 31, divorced, just got out of an awful relationship, and i am SO excited for these next adventures. I’m going to see some BEAUTIFUL places, learn fascinating history, drink, laugh, meet new people, and I can hardly wait. 

I’ve been through a pretty wild ride the last several years and I just feel like I am in a really good place. I have good friends, good family, a job I love that pays the bills, and I am able to do things like get a Disneyland pass and travel to new places. I am so happy and grateful to be where I am in life and I hope everyone finds this level of contentment ❤️"
happy,"I learned a new word the other day and am practicing it now.

Hurkle-durkle originates from the Scottish language which means to lounge in bed longer than when you should have gotten up.

I think I can be an Olympic class or professional hurkle-durkler.  I've been practicing so long without knowing it that I'm actually a professional my first time trying!!!!   

May everyone have at least one hurkle-durkle day a week."
happy,"My mom has been a green thumb enthusiasts. Her garden is a beautiful mess with half edibles and flowers and it's a little slice of her happy place.


But she has always been strictly a roses, carnations and dahlias only gardener with the odd daisy, marigold or iris thrown in. Wildflowers to her were the equivalent of weeds (lol).


A few weeks ago, I had been feeling down and I saw a video of a wildflower meadow that looked stunning. I mentioned to my mum about how happy they made me due to the bright colors, the bees and butterflies it attracted. That's it, that's all I said. She nodded and didn't say much. 


Well this morning I saw the tall grassy patch she had left to 'recover and compost' before she planted veg in had wildflowers. 


She seeded the bare patch for me without asking. Just because it made me happy. It made me feel so loved in that moment. Mom cares. She heard and saw what I was feeling and decided to build me a small wildflower patch so I could sit outside and escape my depression.


After years of a rocky relationship, we are finally building a solid foundation with wildflowers."
happy,"I've been pretty depressed for several month and I just started to get better. I've develloped a crush on a old schoolmate that is really beautiful and out of my league, but I'm not pessimistic of my chances.

We talk a little bit on instagram. Nothing more nothing less. It is nice even tho nothing is really happening.
I didn't saw her in real life for like 3 years. Only on social medias

This morning I took the Subway to go to work and I saw her in the train. God she was beautiful !
She left after just 4 stations but that was such a cool moment for me.
Nothing happened, but just the fact that I got the opportunity to see her in real life made that day a bit better :)"
happy,"I applied at a movie theater the other day, and went there to interview earlier. I had a really cool conversation with one of the managers about working there. Sidebar but I love movies and always talk about them!! I left with confidence thinking I WILL get the job. Lo and behold about two hours after I left that manager called me back and offered me the job! I am so excited to finally work at a movie theater! Like I said I LOVE movies and talking about them so this is like the perfect job for me! I cannot wait to start working for them!"
happy,"Sorry for the late post, I was busy today so I didn't get my walk in until 7pm. But I made up for it with a picture of something else other than a view! I walked about 2 miles, mostly because I was given permission to walk around the properties on the hill. 

I've also decided to switch to weekly updates, as I don't want to clog r/happy with just my posts. It's just not fair to other posters. 

I love y'all and if you need anything, a pep talk, walking advice, or just wanna talk please feel free to DM me, as I'm alwaysore than happy to talk. Cheers!"
happy,Fitting for a family of hobbits.
happy,"I went to bed sad and preoccupied, I woke up groggy and then... 

Then I went to see my freshly repoted baby tomatoes, some of them grew a third cute leaf when I thought I fucked it all up ! New leaves on my plants (I'm a young plant parent, 20 plants besides the vegetables) give me hope, it's like starting anew, being reborn... 

What is the thing that made You smile today?"
happy,"When I'll start earning my own income, I'll definitely have my personal libary within my room! I really want to discover, read and acquire new books!

  
I'm so happy to think about it!!"
happy,He’s getting out and I’m going to ft Campbell I’m lowkey depressed since I know not a single soul out there and all my friends I had are either somewhere else or gone and I tend to stick to a crowd that doesn’t drink the kookaid 24/7 I’m happy but deeply sad any advice?
happy,"
I have been bullied for a lot of my childhood for various reasons and one of them was me being a little chubby (I was not even overweight) so it naturally destroyed my self confidence and caused me to develop anxiety and even depression at one point. I also struggle with binge eating while stressed. 

Now growing up my parents might have made a few mistakes here there that I could not handle but lately they seem to talk to me in a more positive and mature manner and it warms my heart. I know for a fact that they had to unlearn certain behaviours and ideas to have this outlook.


For example the other day I noticed that my favourite pair of jeans started ripping apart near the thigh area and I was beating myself up for it getting torn because I have put on weight since I bought them two years back. My parents casually reassured me that it was just a piece of clothing and I can always get a new pair that fits me perfectly. They also said clothes are meant to fit you and not the other way around . It might not sound much to them but for me it was a huge deal. 

Also I love dressing masculine and wearing clothes from men’s section all the time, even though I personally think clothes are genderless but corporate world doesn’t really think the same right, so we happen to have a lot of stores that exclusively sell menswear. When I first started to ask my mom to take me the store she immediately took me there no questions asked, she never says anything to me when getting clothes from the men’s section. I know this is how it should be but I know a lot of friends who aren’t allowed to do the same.  I mentioned this to her and she casually went clothes are for comfort and people can wear whatever they want as long as they feel good wearing them 😭❤️

These things may not look like a big deal to everyone but I know little me would be jumping with joy right now."
happy,"Hi, just posting here because I like the vibe and everyone sub talking about jobs is depressing and bleh. I have a question, I was recently hired into the bank 6 months ago with no prior experience and I am loving it. I recently got a promotion and I'm starting to stress because I don't know where I want this to take me. I'm very excited, as I know I will do very well but I want to try to refine what I want to do so I have more of a direction but have no idea how to find out what I wanna do. Also, how do I relax and enjoy my life, instead of always thinking about work and where I could do better, Thanks!!"
happy,"Howdy y'all,

A little background: so I'm autistic with a few special interests, e.g. history, aviation, and hot dogs (that one's not important, but still hot dogs are awesome, fight me lol)

Today is not my birthday, but as I'm in the middle of a grueling job search, my friends thought it important to take me out early to both cheer me up and ensure I had a day off.

That is what I assumed, at least!

Turns out these absolute a-holes tricked me and treated me to a lovely day around the city enjoying my favorite things. We went and had a fabulous breakfast before jumping ship to an aviation museum, then enjoying a day by the beach in a more touristy spot of my city before finally going to an art museum styled after a Roman Villa (the Getty Villa in Los Angeles, I highly recommend if you're ever out this way)

Now, I had a blast, but as it turns out, they had one more surprise for me.

A plane ticket to Rome with complete reservations for accommodations!

I'm having a panic attack. I don't know how to respond. I don't know how to pay them back. I'm so incredibly lucky! What could I have possibly done to deserve any of this?!"
happy,"He loves history , spiders , technology , art and America . He’s got the most wonderful blue eyes and he likes to play in the snow like me. 

It’s never been about his appearance or anything material . I love his mind. I love speaking with him. I love every word out of his mouth. I’ve truly never felt such a deep passion for somebody. 

He’s 30 and I’m 25 and I swear I went 25 years of my life searching for a mind and soul like his . 

I love when we passionately flirt with each other and talking about breathing each other in and caressing each other . 

I love staying up late at night messaging him till I fall asleep and hearing him say his praises to me . 

C I love you forever and I want to be with you forever like this 

Give it 2 more years when I’m done with school and I think we’ll get married and by 5 more I think we might be able to have a family .. 

I wanna spend every thanksgiving and Christmas with you for the rest of my life 

C …. Please stay with me forever … you’re a beaming star in my night sky "
happy,"I love people. I find it so fascinating how incredibly intricate every single person is, and there’s billions of us! I genuinely love seeing people walking outside or at school. I’m excited to see my friends, yes, but I also love the fact that I get to see everyone else’s faces every day. I’ve never really empathized with those that say they hate the majority of people. I get being hurt and losing the ability to trust, I can understand it, but I don’t think I could really just hate people in general. I love people’s faces, not just the eyes, but the noses and the smiles and the way skin crinkles. I get so excited at the prospect of meeting new people, because that’s one more entire life I get to interact with! That person an entire world of inner thought and experiences that is allowing me to take part in their experience of the world. Idk I just really love people a whole lot."
happy,"My dad bought me a razer deathadder, and i already am seeing improvement."
happy,"This is so weird , but a few days ago my boyfriend and I went into a little no-contact stage after a small argument we had over something petty . 

It wasn’t specific or anything but we both just stopped reaching out and got busy . 


Well yesterday after like 2 days of no contact , I go to message him on instagram and the second my message delivered, I received a message from him on text message 😂 

We literally messaged each other at the exact same moment after 2 days and were thinking of each other exactly at the same moment 

So adorable haha "
happy,Back from a deployment and finally got to take my mom out for a birthday celebration. Long overdue.
happy,"23 Male and going through a Major Depression to the point I rarely get out of my bed unless I have to go to my shitty job.

I was just endlessly scrolling when I got a call from an old highschool friend of mine. What's funny is that I've always wanted to contact my old highschool friends but insecurities and self doubt always gets the better of me.

He called me to ask how I was doing, and of course I lied and said I was doing OK. He said he was doing fine too and we talked for a bit. And he also asked that we should hang out sometime, and said sure. 

I know it might seem sad and pathetic to be happy over a call but that made me feel good."
happy,"Today marks 1 year of not experiencing a panic attack. 🥹 Mine were severe - included vomiting, heart irregularities, tremors, sweating, a fleeting feeling, and occasionally paralysis. I felt as though I would never be free of these, until I moved and surrounded myself with lovely, caring individuals. I have not had one since and I want to jump around in happiness. My mental health was declining a few years back and now I feel like it might be at its positive peak which I’m eternally grateful for. This past week especially I’ve felt an overwhelming sense of peace. Just wanted to post in case anyone else is suffering, I still get anxiety but from all the work ive done and being in the right place has helped so much and the anxiety is very minor. 🙌🏼💕"
happy,"I went septic 2 years ago due to a kidney stone that was obstructing my kidneys flows but after almost  3 YEARS (and it growing 2mm) its out due to me going to the ER and getting medicine because I knew something was wrong!

Listen to your body, and advocate as much as you need!"
happy,Me and my wife have been together 20 years in October and married 16 in November. As long as I've known her she's been a smoker. I was a smoker myself. I finally kicked the habit three years ago. Bur my wife has been incredibly stubborn on the subject. Today we talked for a while and she decided to take steps to quit. I couldn't be happier with this decision. I'm aware that this will not he easy but she's at least willing. And I'm gonna stand by her and take all the crap that comes with quitting. If it means she can improve her health and I can have her longer I am more than willing to be her punching bag for a few weeks. I'm very proud because she really didn't want to do this. 
happy,This works good if I'm sad about stuff that isn't a huge deal which is a lot of the time haha
happy,I’m living proof that we *DO* recover!

happy,"2 years ago, my partner worked at Habitat for Humanity as a family coordinator, where she would help families apply, understand the criteria, and screen families for eligibility. There was a lovely immigrant family of 4, a mom, dad, teenage son, and younger daughter who were incredibly sweet and hardworking. The problem was that they applied 4 times, and each time, they either had just the smallest bit over income or they were not selected. My partner saw how hard working they were and how much this would turn their life around. They lived in a small 1 bedroom apartment and spending way too much on rent.  On the 5th application, my partner made sure that everything was correct, they were eligible, and she went to bat for them during committee selections, ensuring they got a house this time. They talked so often throughout the process and the mom called my partner her “daughter”, that is how close they became. Then one day, my partner gets home and tells me that this family got approved to get a new house after 2 years of rejections. I was floored with emotions as I had become so invested in their wellbeing. 

Now, my partner was the one that would be calling and letting the families know that they would be eligible to receive a home. I was so invested in this family that I made sure to listen to the phone call that she made to the mom of the family on speakerphone. As soon as she called, the mom thought something else was wrong and she didn’t get a home this round. Instead, my partner broke the news that they would be getting a house. That was when I immediately started balling my eyes out. I’m crying, my partner is crying, and the mom was crying.  It’s really hard to describe the amount of love the mom had for my partner and the gratitude she had for my partner doing everything she could to get them a home. I cried for a long time, even after they hung up. I’ve never felt so happy for someone else being so happy. To this day, when I think about that phone call, I tear up and could cry just like that day. I’ve never cried from happiness this way for anyone. As I write this, my eyes fill with tears thinking back to that beautiful moment. 

Later, the mom brought my partner a whole cake and other expressions of gratitude. It’s a moment that will stay with me for the rest of my life. Today, this family is thriving more than they ever have and we keep up with them. "

happy,"So I'm 16 and over 300lbs, and yesterday I made a post about me taking my first proper walk in over a year. Y'all made me feel so seen, I felt like I wasn't alone in this journey and I'm appreciative of all of you. I want to make an update everyday to hold myself accountable in a public space. I hope that my posts can inspire just 1 person to start doing the same. Cheers!"
happy,I absolutely love pineapple and strawberries! I buy them precut because it’s time consuming but one day I was rambling with my mom complaining about how expensive it is to buy precut fruits so she took it upon herself to buy some pineapples and cut them up and wash the strawberries! ☺️ I’ll finish them in like 2 days lol
happy,"I love reddit podcasts, but they can be so saddening, especially the stories about pulling ""pranks"" like lying about tragedies or physical harm. I love to do the complete opposite with my boyfriend, and last night was my favorite. He woke up yesterday and the first thing he said to me was ""I am craving white birthday cake."" so I figured, what's a birthday cake without a birthday party? Here's the prank... his birthday is in July. We gave him the ultimate surprise birthday party when he got off his mother's day restaurant shift."
happy,"Recently Ive opened myself up expanded my horizons and gotten with some really cool people, microbiologists, actresses from london, screenwriters from new york, Bob Ross trained painters, wave scientists, hang gliding instructors. 

Just wanted to put it out there and be grateful for the opportunities that have come my way in the last couple of months.

 Who would have thought that there were so many opportunities, experiences, and pretty faces out there.

happy,"I'll get my certification in the mail soon. I was so nervous as the desktop was loading to give me my grade. I'm just happy to be done and over with it all. Thank god. 🙏🏼 I can't wait to get it in the mail. 

Please pray for me (if you pray) because I have a 100question exam that I'll be taking on my own time this weekend for Lean Six Sigma / project management. 🤞🏼 It's a 2hr test, 100 questions. "
happy,"Ill try to be short and sweet, but basically I mentioned to my boyfriend, close friend of two years boyfriend for almost one year, that I'd really love a prom-posal for our senior year since I've never experienced one and it's a once in a lifetime kinda thing for us.

It was a while ago and I assumed her forgot because his schedule with school, sports, gym, etc has him running around. I wasn't even upset and chose to keep it to myself since I know his life is already hectic and didn't want to feel like I was pressuring him.

Well today we were in my room relaxing, I bought some small Lego sets to do, before we started building them he told me if I wanted to see a card trick he just learned.

He dabbles in card tricks and magic, when we first met he did a lot of magic for me, I love watching these tricks to this day. He sat me down next to him and started going on about Royal flush being the best hand in poker while doing the trick for me. I was confused but going along with it and before I knew it he said ""You know what else would be the best, you going to prom with me"" and in front of me the royal flush hand with heart cards with will you go to prom with me on the cards.

I'm heavily emotional and started bawling my eyes like a baby cause he caught me off guard and I didn't know what to say but he reminded me I had to say Yes while hugging me lol.

Regardless, I'm still tearing up over it still cause I can't believe how great of a guy he is and I adore every nerdy, geeky ounce of him.

I just wanted to share this because even though I know it's probably some silly high school romance I still feel like the luckiest person in the world.

Hope you're all having a good day or night and I wish the best for all of you who took time to read this sappy stuff :)"
happy,"So it started in 2020, We met while playing roblox i
approached her, (yes she was a girl im not gonna namedrop) we played roblox day and night enjoying games, we
chatted in the roblox chat feature whenever we weren't playing some chats lasted 3 hours, it was enjoyable until she stopped chatting, everytimee then we could
only communicate every 1 month and so with such
short messages, Thats when she told me she had a
new account, there is when it started we stopped talking completely- Skip to 2022- she told me her new account
and i understood why we couldnt talk much, and then after a few conversations and games, She disappeared completely i was really worried - Skip to 2023-2024-in 2023 i kept chatting her updating new stuff that happened in my life, i missed her completey even if we are just online friends, shes gone.. One last message in 2024 on january

wont repeat again i dont want to lose her, Im going to do everything i can. (I want you guys advice on this, pls tell me your thoughts..)"
happy,"NSFW for mention of suicide 

This time last year I was lower than I've been. I remember having to pull my car over because I was crying so hard I couldn't see. I remember sitting with my loaded gun and the only thing that stopped me is kids often go to the park I was in. I remember trying to wreck into a semi after a particularly bad day. For years I was so depressed and so low I never imagined things could be this good. 

But now I wake up everyday overjoyed. I go to work and even though it's work I love it. I shower and I don't sit and cry. I ride with my windows down and sing along to my music and thank my God that I'm alive to see today. That I didn't opt out before I turned 18 like I thought I would. That I made it to 22 like I didn't believe I could. That I wake up today at 25 happier than I've ever been my entire life. I smile and I laugh and I love and I took control of what made my life so awful and kicked its ass until I had full control. 

I think back on all those years I spent unhappy and hating myself and harming myself and I wish I could talk to old me and tell her that it does get better. It takes a long time and alot of shit but you come out on top. 

25 is so young and my life is so full now and I just wanted someone to know. I'm just happy and that's all I've ever wanted and all I'll ever want. I'm just happy to be happy yall"

happy,"I just wanted to share to everyone that I am truly happy. The past couple of weeks, I have spent my afternoons and nights outside on my back porch just enjoying life. Sometimes I will watch my phone, or I’ll browse Reddit, but just being outside in the bliss, cool, and calming air just makes me feel some kind of way. Pair that with the beautiful sounds of the birds, and the frogs in the distance. It all just puts me at ease. Most of my life has been pretty stressful, especially now that I’m graduating high school in less than a month. To be able to enjoy the creations of God with the moon shining, the chirps of the birds in the trees, the speckled sky littered with stars, and the gentle sway of the pine trees… I’ve rambled. Point is guys, I truly feel happy. I have nothing to complain about. I have great friends, great parents, a cute little chihuahua, supporting teachers and staff at my school, and most importantly what seems to be a great future. No idea what I’ve done to deserve it all but I’m grateful. Just wanted to share my emotions because seeing life at face value, excluding all negatives, is so special to me. "
happy,"I am working out and feeling great.  I have a job that I enjoy.  My marriage is better than it ever has been.  My relationship with my kids is better than ever.  After so many years I am in a good head space.

But now colors seem brighter.  Food tastes better.  It’s great to wake up to a new day every day."

happy,"Hello everyone! If you look on my profile I’ve posted once a year about my weight loss. I started originally at 320 (although I was too embarrassed to admit it) and got to I think 250 before I got hurt, gained more weight, lost some. Now for 2023. Over the end of 2022 and into 2023 I let a coworker treat me to lunch every day. Where I ate a ton and really fell back into my old terrible habits and all that.
Since September something in me changed. (Also me and that coworker stopped talking, they were a terrible influence but I’m not go into that here) I have cut out most sugars and in general crappy food out. I usually eat one good meal a day. 
I originally started this just to lose weight out of embarrassment of how bad I had let myself go. Now, I just want to feel better. I’ve seen how much my diet change has improved how I feel and the lost weight helps a ton too. I feel so much better about myself. I just want to change now for the betterment of my health, now for how I look.
So here’s my post this year to keep myself accountable (and also people have said they wanted to see my updates as the years go on)
My end goal right now for this year is to be near 220, but I’d REALLY like to be under 200. So let’s see how 2024 will treat me and you and I hope we can accomplish our goals. If you made it this far reading, I thank you! See you next year!"

But today he surprised me back by proposing me 😅🥺 So apparently he had plans to propose me before but the ring wasn’t delivered on time , so he was planning to propose me later this month. But since I visited him suddenly, he took this opportunity to surprise me back by taking out the ring at this magical hike we had today. This is probably the best thing ever happened to me, the uno reverse we all need in life ! 😭🤍✌️"
happy,"* hang out with people you love. go out, get drunk, have fun. everything in moderation hehe
* touch people. hugs, touches, pets, holding hands, squeezes, cuddles... EVERYTHING
* talk to people. open up. it's okay to allow yourself to be held by the people you want to be cared by. *it's okay to have the selfish desire to be burdensome*. it is OKAY! keep moving. never stay in one place too long (small and large scale). *comfort is the foil of growth.*
* exercise. even if you don't feel like going, just do 15 minutes. the rest will come. and I KNOW you always feel better after moving. whether it be a walk after dinner, a gym run, or even a a simple stretch outside. 
* always push yourself. no matter how hard it seems, you can always go further. one extra lap, minute, or rep... just that extra breath of effort will push you boundlessly. you will realize you can overcome the goals you set for yourself, which slowly seep into the rest of your life. 
* correct negative thoughts gently. when you feel hateful, reflect on your own thoughts. why are you being mean? your inner thoughts heavily influence your perspective on the outer world. humans are creatures of projection, so PLEASE be kind to yourself and others.
* eat breakfast. even if you don't think you want to. a coffee, a fruit, or a slice of bread. I promise that extra boost of energy is worth it. 
* talk to people that make you happy. keep the company of people who uplift you. keep those who support you, purge the ones who denounce you. *may the bridges you burn light the way!* 
* talk less, act more. for me, actions have always spoken louder than words. making less excuses and just doing things will help propel your plot. 
* MUSIC. listen to it, play it, learn it, make it, worship it. make playlists, sing songs, listen with people. it's the best thing to boost you up and feel understood when no one else understands. (the best part about music is there's so freaking much of it you can't possibly find something you don't like)
* question your perspective to the world. think of the external and internal causes that lead you to your beliefs. learn to question EVERYTHING, but keep a grounding foot on your intuition as well.
* don't overthink. if you're self conscious about it, they probably are too. no one is focusing on your faults. you are your biggest critic! 
* you get out what you put out and that's that!

***\* DISCLAIMER: \****

this is the unsolicited advice of a (highly opinionated) 22F yr old onliner, so take everything with a grain of salt. this just happens to be a helpful guide i keep in my notes app and wanted to share. 

on paper, i have no impressive concrete accomplishments in my life. i am a classic instance of a burnt-out-gifted-kid turned college drop out. so, if you would like to tell me i am living my life wrong, go ahead. 

i am quite content. 

i have spent a lot of  time trying to find that sense of normalcy we've all been aching for since graduating high school. it felt like i would never experience that grandiose feeling of truly ""living in the moment"" and ""seeing in color"" again.  i wished the world would pause for me just once. just to allow me to relive a core memory from my childhood again. but alas, that nostalgic relief never comes... 

because truly, life goes on, and it never stops. 

to some, it might sound harsh, but i interpret it as a comfort saying. accepting that ""it is what it is"" but ""what ***will*** be, is in my hands"", is the most important takeaway. 

ultimately, there is no ""cure"" or solution to find happiness. it comes and goes, wanes and rises, just as the moon and the sun! if you remember the world always has balance, whether it be spiritually, mentally, or physically, you begin to understand that 

spread kindness and patience, or don't. it is up to you do as you please! just remember to challenge yourself always, and truly focus with intention.

happy,"Ill try to be short and sweet, but basically I mentioned to my boyfriend, close friend of two years boyfriend for almost one year, that I'd really love a prom-posal for our senior year since I've never experienced one and it's a once in a lifetime kinda thing for us.

It was a while ago and I assumed her forgot because his schedule with school, sports, gym, etc has him running around. I wasn't even upset and chose to keep it to myself since I know his life is already hectic and didn't want to feel like I was pressuring him.

Well today we were in my room relaxing, I bought some small Lego sets to do, before we started building them he told me if I wanted to see a card trick he just learned.

He dabbles in card tricks and magic, when we first met he did a lot of magic for me, I love watching these tricks to this day. He sat me down next to him and started going on about Royal flush being the best hand in poker while doing the trick for me. I was confused but going along with it and before I knew it he said ""You know what else would be the best, you going to prom with me"" and in front of me the royal flush hand with heart cards with will you go to prom with me on the cards.

I'm heavily emotional and started bawling my eyes like a baby cause he caught me off guard and I didn't know what to say but he reminded me I had to say Yes while hugging me lol.

Regardless, I'm still tearing up over it still cause I can't believe how great of a guy he is and I adore every nerdy, geeky ounce of him.

I just wanted to share this because even though I know it's probably some silly high school romance I still feel like the luckiest person in the world.

Hope you're all having a good day or night and I wish the best for all of you who took time to read this sappy stuff :)"
happy,"Basically what the title says. I don't really have anyone else to share this with, but I feel quite accomplished. My story is basically growing up poor, a bunch of federal and private loans to get a degree (out of state, had to escape the crabs in that barrel), loan to get a decent vehicle, and then I got a job as far away as I could manage. Now, just shy of my 27th birthday, all of my loans are paid off right as my employer is paying to send me back to get a master's degree in my field (I start next term). It feels like I'm free, truly free, for the first time in my life. "
happy,This picture makes my day because it just says B 00 bs in a funny place!
happy,She marked her 3rd year sober Friday.
happy,"My washroom needed a good renovation for yearrrsss. Luckily, my dad does renovations for a living. With the help of our really friendly neighbour, they decided to take ln my washroom as their next project. I’m so happy a grateful for how it came out !!! :,DDD"
happy,"I didn’t even interview, she said she knew she wanted to hire me for the position which shocked me as it was not the position I originally applied for. I know I won’t get paid right away but it’s something my landlord (hopefully) will work with. I haven’t had any money coming into this home for the last 3 months and to start working in a field I have been wanting to be in, brings tears to my eyes. 

I hope this is long enough and fleshed out more so it won’t get flagged. I NEVER post things that are private but with this win I feel like maybe I should start sharing with the world a bit more. Thank you for taking the time to read this message. "
happy,"I know it's not a huge deal but after a lot of research and taking my time I successful did a full brake job on my vehicle. I've been driving it for a week now and it's been a smooth ride, great braking and just overall really happy that I was able to complete it. In a way it really built some significant confidence for myself. I usually just do my own oil changes so this was a big step forward."
happy,"So I’m 17 and an engineering intern. I started last year mid-February and it’s been going pretty good. At Christmas, I got a $330 bonus ($200 after taxes) and I was super happy with that. Today, my boss stopped by my office and said they usually give out year end bonuses but their system wasn’t working right this year so it was a bit late. He said to remember that I’m only really part time and when I said I appreciate it no matter what he said “it’s better than a stick in the eye”. 

So after he said that, I thought it was gonna be like $100 max right, but I open it and see ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS!! It’s $640 after taxes and I know that isn’t a ton to some people BUT I AM SUPER HAPPY. And yesterday I found out I’m getting $1500 back in taxes so I am going to be absolutely ballin!!!! HELL YEAH!!!"
happy,"I spent all of February in rehab for alcohol. I spent 6 months in a homeless shelter, got my CDL, picked out a company of my choosing, bout to be an uncle 3 times over, and recently celebrated 7 months sober! This is the first time in 6 years I’ve been truly happy. If you’re having a hard time feel free to contact me, I’d love to chat!"
happy,"It was just a passing comment during a phone call. To be honest, I kind of forgot I even mentioned it . Today I found a package on my doorstep.


Still can't figure out if it's a cat or a rabbit. There are two modes, rainbow and normal light. What should I name it?"
happy,"My boyfriend and I almost always play pool during our lunch break, more often than not betting something per game. Well, the bet we're cashing in this weekend is something I'm really looking forward to! We're gonna lay out blankets and pillows galore in the living room, introduce him to Star Wars for May 4th, order some ramen, snuggle puddle with my bunny (he loves my bf), and add pictures to our lovey dovey scrapbook.   
  
This man is so sweet, I'm truly able to let out my hopeless romantic side with him and get it right back without hesitation. Not to mention I just renewed my lease and we added his name to it! Having a safe and healthy love is one of the greatest feelings in the world. I love and adore him, and feel so giddy knowing he's just as crazy about me, too. :)"
happy,"So, basically I had 1€ in my bank account, a d my best friend transfered the remaining 5 to me, because we wanted to play a game together that was on sale. I'm so grateful and happy. I'm definitely going to pay him back though, because I would feel bad if I didn't. Besides, it's the right thing to do. He just deserves the world. Of course, I told him that he didn't have to since it's just a game i could get dor the regular price next month, but he insisted so much, because he knew how much I liked the game from watching him play it during shareplay.

As someone has asked this before in this thread : I'm not comfortable sharing private information with strangers such as sharing my PayPal info."
happy,"Stop living in your head and start living your truth. No one is worthy of judging you. We live on earth for such a short time. You want to spend it sad, stressed, and with anxiety? Fuck that!"
happy,"This isn't an advertisement or anything like that, I just love it. 

I work two jobs from home, and I didn't follow the advice of ""Separate your work space from your personal space"" (it's better for your mental health) so I spend effectively 13 hours a day at my desk, with my work PC and personal PC on the same desk right next to one another. I flip my monitor between PCs, so the space I used to go to to have fun, play games, and hang out with online friends is effectively ruined by 13 hours a day being trapped in this spot. I work from 5AM-7PM and get one single day off a week. Of COURSE I'm not going to want to spend another *second* of my time at that desk than I have to. 

Obviously, this caused all my steam games to go neglected, as well as the couple little online friends I keep up with. This simply can't do. So, I bought a steam deck. 

What a wonderful little handheld computer! It can run a few itch.io games on it, they don't even have to be steam games! And there's a game from 2005 that REALLY DIDN'T like the steam deck when I first launched it (The fucking mouse cursor was controlled by the gyro function for some reason?!) but the controls are so customizable on that thing that within just 20 or 30 minutes of messing with it I got it running so comfortably that it's not just tolerable but *enjoyable* to play on the deck. I love it. It was so easy to figure out, so easy to personalize, and it's just great. 

I play games more now than I even did on my PC before I was work from home. In fact, I prefer the steam deck over my PC. I'm just not a graphics-heavy gamer and the games I play don't require fast reflexes and pinpoint accuracy, so the deck is perfect for my style of single player meandering-along story games. And I always tended to enjoy a controller more than mouse and keyboard anyway. So, just having all my games be mobile?! Man. Least regrettable big purchase I have made in a WHILE. I would buy a new one tomorrow if my current one broke. 

Again, not an advertisement. I'm just a casual gamer, with casual games, which I love to casually enjoy. And the invention of such a neat, user friendly, handheld ""gaming"" computer makes me happy. Happy-happy!!! 

Edited to add: Oh, didn't even mention. The #1 benefit is that I can be snuggled up to my family members while gaming! That's honestly the main reason I bought it. I love the people I live with and being trapped in my room all the time means I can't see them, and if I wanted to game, I'd have to take away even more time from the 3 hours a day I get to visit with them. The steam deck gives me the benefit of cuddles AND gaming. Truly living the life here, folks. "
happy,"Friday my friend told me she overheard teacher's talking about how they wanted *me* in their classes, some of them I had never even talk to/had a class with. Another teacher told an EA (my friend's mom) how excited she was to have me in her class AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
happy,"So I’ve been wanting to be more like my awesome marathon runner Papa. He’s always been a wonderful athlete! Running marathons when he was younger to playing softball now, in his 80’s. He’s the coolest guy, I’m dying to be more like him. Not just physically but emotionally too. He’s always been so chill. 

I set a goal to try to walk five miles every other day just to start, and to my surprise I’ve actually gone and done it! Pokémon GO tracks the duration of my walks and I’ve walked more than thirty miles each week for the past three weeks. I’m over the moon! 🐮 Just wanted to share some happy news. I hope you all have a nice day today!  

"
happy,"I’m a friendly person so I know or recognize a lot of folks in person, but I am dogshit at recalling names. 

She said hello to me first and I said, “hey (redacted)!” and we had a nice chat about living here. Sounds like the last person to live in my place was really neat, so I have some cool shoes to fill! 

Hooray for small steps in self improvement and mundane conversations!"
happy,Winter cat
happy,"I paid off my house today and I am 100% debt free!

For context on this, my finances got really messed up by a combination of the great recession and my husband passing away in 2007-2008.I started with almost nothing except for my kids and my job skills. I slowly rebuilt my life and finances step-by-step.

I had a low interest rate, but I wanted to pay off my home loan since retirement is not too far away. I have a few more years to top off my savings then I can pull the plug on my career.

I set a goal for myself to pay off my house and this morning I called the bank and did it. So happy that this long stretch of frugality finally paid off!"
happy,Had to get lab work today and found this on the way out! I DO feel lucky! 
happy,"With things as grim as they've been the last few years, I decided I'd get a bit of summer work last year while I was off uni so I could fund a long weekend on the seaside after, as well as a trip to Berlin I'm looking to do with my friends this summer. To cut a long story short, I got a job at uni working in the applicant call centre, where people who were meant to be joining this year could phone up and make enquiries.

A-level results day (I'm from the UK) rolls around and sure enough we get a load of people calling up who've not had the right grades for the course they wanted. Basically, the process is that we ask them for their grades, look up what other relevant courses they'd be eligible for, then forward them on to the department if there's space and they're interested. We have one option called a Foundation Year, where you only need a CDD or something like that to be eligible. You basically do a year of baseline work in your subject area to show that you're competent, then you can go on to do the course you originally wanted.

I took 90-something calls that day, and referred about ten or so people on for foundation years, along with a small handful of other people for other courses. I worked about 12 hours that day, and so I went for a pint afterwards to unwind. I remembered a couple of years prior when a friend of mine didn't get the grades he needed and had to call up the uni, so I've seen how hopeless people can feel when they have to do it. While I was drinking, I had this realisation that, thanks to my intervention, those people were able to still find a way into the uni they wanted to be at. I hadn't had a great past year at uni myself, and so I felt like I'd actually served a purpose that day for the first time in ages"
happy,"I’m nervous but also really proud of myself because I made a doctors appointment and I haven’t been in five or six years because we don’t have public transpertation in my town, I can’t drive and people that could drive me always had something going on, also I have some pretty bad phone anxiety. I have no idea what I’ll need to do, because its been so long, and even before than it had been another five or so years, so I’m at a lost, but super excited that I’m finally getting things done."
happy,"I wanted to share this online to give some hope. We can do this. Love you all, take care ok? ❤️"
happy,"Stop living in your head and start living your truth. No one is worthy of judging you. We live on earth for such a short time. You want to spend it sad, stressed, and with anxiety? Fuck that!"
happy,"Hello and Happy New Year folks! My first post here, hope everyone is doing well and it's time to start being happy 😊"
happy,"I'm an artist in NYC and the last several months have been brutally slow. After a lot of exhausting work, and serious anxiety about what they would say, not 1 but both people who reached out to me said they were going through with their purchases!!! I am soooooo happy and relieved!!! I'll be taking myself out to dinner tomorrow to celebrate 🥳 🎉  The first painting was called ""A Summer Daydream"" and the second was ""Health, Wealth, Prosperity."" Both acrylic on canvas and lots of love! Cheers to a great new year!! ✨️🥰✨️"
happy,"I shouldn’t be writing this since I’m about to go to bed

  
But sitting at my work desk I was feeling a little stressed about life

  
But something made it all go away

  
I closed my eyes… and starting imagining

  
Imaging my future

  
A future where I’m with my future daughter and I’m pushing her on a swing

  
She’s smiling so much and laughing and calling me daddy.

  
\-you can make it weird, but honestly it was super cute

  
I could clearly see her face so happy

  
Then another time

  
We’re at the beach and she’s older, a teenager

  
And the next scene I’m on my death bed with 5-7 kids around me

  
I’m smiling and they’re crying

  
In the present, the me who is sitting at my work desk is also smiling befause I’ve realised

  
There is no reason to be stressed

  
Thjngs can’t be bad forever, they never are, the only way to make it out of a stressful situation is to keep going and having hope.

happy,"I worked all year while doing school (the maximum amount of hours I was allowed to do I did), I worked during all my breaks and I haven't gone on any trips out of state because I wanted to feel financially sane more than wanting to go out. I've been living bill to bill, rent to rent, month to month and sometimes had to borrow to meet the rent (since my pay is bi weekly).

I've been so bitter all year. Initially it hurt that I had to work and do my difficult stem course and worry about feeding myself while all my friends and classmates lived in their lavish apartments close to school as I commuted from far away to save money. But I don't feel bitter anymore!


I know what living month to month feels like so I'm gonna still do max hours of work. But I'm gonna be able to give myself 2 weeks of breaks between semesters now. 


I'm moving in with my boyfriend too which will reduce my rent by so much since we're splitting.

&#x200B;

I'm so happy. I hope no crisis will take away this safety net I have built. I hope that when my parents travel here I can pay for all of their needs. I'm just happy man. Fingers crossed!!

happy,"They’re both just one year old and my first two puppies.  

I’ve been in a totally dark place for the last two months from losing my girl, my bestfriend, but I’m so thankful that my other dog has saved me.

happy,Happy family. 🙂
happy,It was a cheap one but decided to try real Champaign to celebrate 
happy," I've been the happiest I've been for at least the past five years. No real complaints, no real worries. I mean, little day to day things like in a sitcom, but nothing crazy. I get up not worried about hating my job, don't think I have any real enemies, have a wonderful family and have the means to take care of them. Not religious either, so this is not fueled by my love for a higher being.

I found what makes me happy and don't really need anything else. Delighted to share my positive vibes if anyone needs some."
happy,"I love reddit podcasts, but they can be so saddening, especially the stories about pulling ""pranks"" like lying about tragedies or physical harm. I love to do the complete opposite with my boyfriend, and last night was my favorite. He woke up yesterday and the first thing he said to me was ""I am craving white birthday cake."" so I figured, what's a birthday cake without a birthday party? Here's the prank... his birthday is in July. We gave him the ultimate surprise birthday party when he got off his mother's day restaurant shift."
happy,"I love him so very, very much."
happy,Started the year making better changes. Ive lost 19lbs in total since January.
happy,"It's been some time since we have time to go out on our own, she realized that the zoo give her a free ticket fkr her b-day, so we said ""why not?"""
happy,"...Say Yes to the Dress! I've watched it before and it's always been a blast, but in the last two days I've been watching SYTTD Australia and Atlanta, and it's exactly what I need right now. So many happy and funny moments and it's just warm feeling to watch people embark on new incredible journeys, even when so much else feels like it's ending.

I love sharing joys and wins with people, and being able to do that with people I'll never meet is really filling a hole in my soul right now."
happy,I can’t even describe this. I feel so light and nice and light and my head is spinning 
happy,"If a genie or another supernatural being approached me when I was 10 years old and asked me for three wishes, I would definitely ask for the following: 

* to find true love (I was a very romantic kid, haha)
*  to become a teacher
*  and to make video games. 

It took a long time, but finally, at the age of 30, I met the most wonderful woman ever, and she miraculously fell in love with me too. That happened in 2016. 

For various reasons, I had started and quit my studies multiple times. However, in 2020, I was finally able to teach my first class in high school! Yes, it was the year of the pandemic, and it was challenging, but I loved it and it has become my profession. 

In January of this year (2023), I decided that it was time to seriously pursue making video games. In November, I released my first game! It was an amazing experience, to the point that game development has become my number one hobby. 

I don't know what the future holds, what 2024 will bring for me or for anyone reading this, but I hope we all continue to pursue our wishes, and maybe even reach them. Happy new year!"

happy,"I recently met someone. Our first date was during the work week, we met for drinks and ended up talking for 6 hours! Our second date was yesterday. It was so nice. We had ice cream and  went to the museum. He’s smart and funny. Artistic and creative. We had great conversation and he was a complete gentleman. He texted today and asked to go on a proper dinner date. 
I’m looking forward to seeing where this could go. ☺️ "
happy,"Don't get me wrong, I'm not racist and I love all the cats!

It's just... ragdoll cats not only are incredibly fluffy and with beautiful eyes but their personality is just so damn awwww :3

They're so damn cuddly. Them being so big and heavy makes it so much better. You get more cat out of a cat I just can't

For sure there's fur everywhere and you need to take great care of them but I find it difficult to even consider that con because of how great they are hahaha"
happy,"My family and I were a bit worried about her.  She’s 12 and we found something on her paw that we thought might have been a tumor.

Ten minutes ago we got a call indicating that it’s not.  I’m thrilled.  "
happy,"We sat and talked for 6 hours yesterday and she said a lot of sweet things to me; like saying I was one of the best things to happen to her (I said that one first; she just said it back). I wish I wrote down the rest of them because I already forgot most of it (my memory is so bad and my life is so dramatically different than it was 3 months ago; new huge things are happening every week; last night I just got the keys to a house on the beach in Venice). There was one thing she said which did stick out, though:

""You're my type: extraordinary.""

No one has ever come close to making me that happy with less than 6 words.

Anyway, I'm about to make one of the biggest pivots of my life. I got an offer to leave the US and move to Switzerland\* and possibly Germany for a bit, so I'm working to change every last piece of me that has been holding me back. I don't know what I will resemble at the end of this, but I know, to at least one person, one of the most amazing people I've ever met, they found me extraordinary at one point in my life.

I honestly don't know that I could ask for a better compliment.

Anyway.

To future me, if you end up reading this, and you're feeling down, you were extraordinary to one of the most amazing people you ever met. That should not ever not matter to you.

\* it was somehow endearing how upset she got over this; I hate hurting her, even if it was inadvertent, but seeing her very upset texts burst through as I'm ""reviving"" my dead phone from an eventful night, was so \*damn\* heart-warming."
happy,Back from a deployment and finally got to take my mom out for a birthday celebration. Long overdue.
happy,"I was infantry, and I used to feel a certain amount a guilt having never killed.  Think of it as survivors guilt in a way, of others have to carry that burden what makes me so special?  But the older I get, the more I’m just all around glad and relieved.  We all think we will be fine when we join, but as you mature you realize there’s no telling how you’ll react.  I can finally, at least for today, say I’m perfectly fine having never been in that situation.  Some may look down on this, but kiss my ass after Taco Bell "
happy,"Most of my life I've had little to no self esteem. I've always thought little of myself. Little to the point I settled for people, things and situations that I didn't deserve. For the last year I've been working on me. I started exercising and I've lost weight, I've grown in my faith, I've even started expanding my mind trying to learn new things, for example I've been studying German for a year for fun. Today I realized I'm not a bad guy and I have a lot of good to offer others and my self image has drastically improved. For the forst time I'm getting some self esteem and I'm starting to like myself which I never have. I just felt like sharing this."
happy,"Even tho it’s quite embarrassing I wanted to share this. This is Caesar my poodle puppy who is ready to greet me early every morning. This means I have to get up and out to walk him first thing, something that I COULD NOT and WOULD NOT ever do before I had him because of my agoraphobia. He has given me more independence and has made me progress so much faster. He even helps with my panic attacks. But most importantly I love him and he makes me happy!"
happy,"I'm 33 weeks pregnant and my husband's bday is Monday. Money is tight and I couldn't take the day off work so this weekend I've been working really hard to make it special. Yesterday made him breakfast, homemade angel food cake (with fresh strawberry toppings), and we went to his cousins for an epic hot pot dinner. Today is his 'lazy' day where he wasn't supposed to do anything but relax. This morning I made breakfast again, cleaned the kitchen, and did laundry. I was super exhausted and laid down to watch a movie. Shortly after my husband comes in with this! The plate was full, but I was so hungry I started eating before I took a picture. My hormones are crazy right now but I'm just so happy! I even cried a little."

happy,"I just feel ecstatic this week full of pride for myself.  I grew up around alot of drugs and awful people, not awful in the sense that they did bad things but awful in the sense they had lost themselves in a pit of drugs and self depreciation.  My mom and my grandma were both addicted to opioid painkillers for like all of my childhood and I never knew my dad so my grandpa raised me and he was a great man he taught me alot of things a dad should like how to shave how to treat people and generally what it means to be a good person.  But nobody lives forever and when he passed things got worse and I was eventually taken by Arkansas CPS when i was 16 in late 2018 and given to my Great Grandma.  Lived with her for a bit then she decided she didn't want me and my oldest sister.  It hurt alot hearing someone just say they didn't want you when you expect them to care for you.  So I was placed in the foster system in January 2019 met lots of good people while I was in the system and I still talk to my foster mom.  I got out of the system in 2022 and left Kansas to come back home to Arkansas and I found myself surrounded by a whole new side of my family my mom had hidden from me my whole life, My Aunt Jamie and her wife Trey helped me get on my feet and my first place.  But me being new to this whole thing after about a year I lost a good job and in turn lost my place.  And then I met my Dad and he's just such a good person who's given me a firm guiding hand in the right direction which I exactly what I needed so now im an Assistant Manager at my local Dominoes and I plan on working here until September or November to say I have a year's worth of Management Experience then looking for a better paying job and this Saturday I'm moving into a new Apartment using all the money I've worked so hard for to save up and I'm just so happy and proud of myself.  And I'm thankful that I got to meet all this family I never knew cared so much about me for so long.  2025 is going to be my year, I hope to finally be able to really worm on myself and keep this winning streak going because this has been the best year or two of my life I'm happier than I've ever been and it's all thanks to my new friends and family. I'm learning to survive and I have to support system I need to finally make myself the person I want to be and I will never take it for granted. "
happy,"There used to be a falling down house across the street from me. Some realtor picked it up on a property tax sale and tore it down. Should have been no big deal and just a normal tear down and rebuild, right? Along the way, I noticed it was taking forever to build 2 homes they decided to build on the lot. It's been almost 2 years since construction started, 1 house is complete, the 2nd is about half finished. I'm home with a work injury, so there isn't much else to watch but this build and the boob tube. And of course, my dogs go berserk whenever people show up over there.

Dogs are going off one day and I look to see what set them off. It's a mold abatement company. I didn't really think too much of it, and a year passed before the house was complete. My friend tells me after she has signed the contract that she's moving across the street from me. That's when the alarm bells went off in my head. I let her know to be thorough in her inspection because they'd already treated this brand-new home for mold. Her jaw hits the floor, and she says that the owner/realtor (both are the same person) didn't disclose that.

There are other problems, like none of the dirt from digging in water lines, nor any gravel in preparation for driveways and sidewalks being compacted. None of the cement has rebar to reinforce and strengthen it to stand up to our winters. The un-compacted water line trenches run under both driveways. I guess hauling off piles of dirt wasn't a clue to the builder that it might be a problem later.

Final inspection day comes, and it takes 2 pry bars operated by 2 fairly large men to get the access to the crawl space open because it's so wet in the crawl space it has made the wood swell quite a bit. Not only is the crawlspace infested with mold, but against code, the crawl space wasn't built with any ventilation. So my friend got out of the contract, and the owner/realtor will likely lose her real estate license for not making proper disclosures.

Yes, it sucks that she has to look for another house, but she's so happy she didn't get stuck in a mold infested trap. And funnily enough, you can hear fans running from over there 24/7 in both houses."

happy,"I know it might be nothing special for you but for me - a person who feels like doesn't make significant progress in English it's quite special. It's more important for me as I didn't attend any special classes to prepare myself for this exam and tbh I didn't prepare at all so it makes me proud of myself that I could pass it relying just on my overall English skills. As a student of applied linguistics that includes studying English in my course, I often feel that I am not even close to the English level of the most of my fellow students and that's true for sure but this exam has shown me that I'm not that bad at English."

Looking a little more closely at the pictures, I could’ve nursed it a little longer (was worried the pot was too small for it), but I tried my best. I didn’t see it at the time. Nonetheless, I am so glad it’s alive and better!

happy," just wanted to tell everyone,to start to appreciate the little things in life.The last two years I have been trying to find happiness and their have been ups and down,I lost some friends and I am even ashamed to say that I have been jealous of my friends having success because I didnt.Today I can say that I love my life,this is because I learnt to appreciate everything.In every single negative aspect in ur life there is something positive and and always remember that.You fight w friends or family,remember that u have friends or family and you are most likely fighting because u care for each other.You woke up in the morning ate  you ate food,thank god and if u dont believe just appreciate that u have food and a house to sleep in.Struggling with exams,you are doing exams u have an education and a future be happy,a negative always opens a door to a positive.Its normal to be jealous about something or someone you cannot stop these feeling but you are in your own path and your time will come and be happy for the person,good for them. Be happy and appreciate.When someone looks at you even on the street smile.They key to happiness is appreciating.Spread love and be nice😁"
happy,"I think I may have perfected my winged liner on slightly hooded eyes! And I tried out a purple liner which makes my brown eyes pop, especially the hazel and green flecks. Just super excited about it and wanted to share!"
happy,"Five years ago I didn't see a future for myself at all. I was sleeping in my rideshare rental car, was in a crappy part time job that I hated, and was living with severe anxiety. Sixteen months ago, I took a chance and decided to give school another try. Thanks to financial aid and scholarships, tuition assistance from my current job, and support from a lot of people around me, I now have an AA in Political Science and graduated Phi Theta Kappa with honors. I have gotten offers from several schools to transfer/finish my BA, including some really good schools (one is an Ivy League school). I've wanted to move to the East Coast (NYC area) since I was 15 and finally have the opportunity at the end of this year, and will be finishing my BA there. My dream is to become a history teacher; history is AWESOME because it helps us to learn about so many facets of society and humanity, and education is a very noble, yet very under-appreciated field that I wish more people would look into. Learning is magical, and as long as we are alive, we have a chance to learn something new."
happy,"Haven't been to a gaming tournament in weeks, because depression hit me hard, to the point I couldn't eat anything sometimes for a couple of days. Pos grad depression hit me hard.

Finally decided I was tired of being a loser, so went to a local gaming tournament and it was amazing.

I talked to some old faces I recognized and even bonded with them even more then usual. I met some new people and I even got some complements on how good I was playing my certain character.

Overall it was so nice to interact with other people even though I was still nervous and self concerned about my appearance and everything, but this experience has convinced me to be more social. I even got invited to play in someone's dorm if I ever wanted to.

I stopped going cause people told me it was lame, and it made me even more depressed and self conscious about it. But I'm glad I'm gonna participate in more."

happy,"I just wanted to share it with somebody who can appreciate it. I am a young aspiring writer and I have never got actual recognition for it before. It's a small contest, but I am still incredibly overjoyed by it. It was a short story, but I mostly specialise in those anyway. It feels so awesome to have someone see my work and like it.
I'm not even excited about whatever my reward will be. I'm just happy someone read that little story and enjoyed it."
happy,"This is gonna start off sad, but I swear it gets better. 

August 2021 I graduated college. October 2021 I was given a job offer for a career I was incredibly excited about. The job offer payed decently, and was a stepping stone for my ex-gf and I at the time to be able to start moving our relationship into a more adult-relationship; ie, moving out, buying a house, etc. 

January 2022 I started at my job and loved it. March 2022 came around, and my ex at the time had blind-sided me and left without a word. I was devastated at the time. Fast forward a few months to October, I’m at the gym and I feel a tendon in the back of my leg snap. I can’t walk. I eventually go to the doctor who just diagnoses me with a strain and tells me to go to PT. 

Long story short, I visited 2 different doctors. Both of whom could not give me a proper diagnosis which caused the PT I received to only make things worse. I was on disability from my job to take care of my leg which just wouldn’t get better, as well as therapy for depression. Eventually, I was forced to leave my job, lost my health insurance, and didn’t know if I’d ever be able to walk again. I was alone, depressed, disabled, unemployed, and had no idea about the future and what was going to happen to me. 

Eventually, I found a physio who I was able to see via Zoom (about $20/visit, so I could afford it without insurance) who was able to diagnose me and we started a PT program that I was able to do by myself. It took a long time, but she got me back on my feet, back in the gym, back to running and everything. It took me about a year to walk again. It was an extremely long process. 

Near the end of my PT, I met this woman. Smart, funny, gorgeous, kind, driven and hard working, incredibly emotionally intelligent, and… well I could go on for hours talking about this woman. We hit it off, and started dating. She’s introduced me to so many new hobbies, many of which are active activities. Some team sports, and some individual sports. I’ve started some new sports of my own, and have began to introduce her to them as well. Not only has meeting her changed my life romantically, but I’ve also gotten very close to all of her friends of which she has many. When my leg didn’t work and I lost my job, I was alone almost 24/7. I had very little help with anything from family and friends. It was the darkest time of my life. Now, I feel like it’s one of the most social and happiest times of my life. It’s been a complete 180 from where I was before. 

When my leg got better, I also applied for a federal job. I’d always wanted to work for the federal government, not just for the benefits but also for the job security. It was a very long and stressful process, but just last week I received the email with a firm job offer and I am due to begin working with them next week. 

My life has completely changed. I was in the darkest time of my life, not knowing what was going to happen to me and not knowing if I’d ever be able to walk again, hold a job, etc. I’ve now picked up a handful of new hobbies, I’m exercising and running frequently, I have a new career which I’m beyond ecstatic to begin, and a wonderful girlfriend of which I can see an actual future with. 

Words cannot begin to describe how absolutely ecstatic I am for what my future holds. "
happy,"I remember getting a notif, looking at my phone, then freaking my family out cuz I just suddenly started jumping up and down yelling 12 DOLLARS! 12 DOLLARS! 😂

I really came a long way with working on music, putting my heart into beats just to make people dance and forget about whatever troubles them, so seeing people begin to support me made me feel happy beyond words.

Finally I can consider myself an actual artist, not just a hobbyist making music for fun, but an actual artist that was capable of inspiring others.

I never thought I'd make it to this point, I know it's a very small win, but its the first step towards many other milestones yet to come.

I have many people to thank, the yt community and soundcloud, but I think Id be years behind if it werent for niche communities on reddit supporting me all the way through.

Its only January and it's already a big year for me ❤️"
happy,"Hi Reddit! I’ve been trying to use my account as an outlet to manage my feelings and healing. I am so excited to share that I was finally able to mow my lawn, rake my leaves, and plant a few seeds in my yard today! Some backstory (trigger warning: SA), I was sexually assaulted by a man that lived on my street, and for the longest time, I was nervous to work on my yard in my front lawn because I did not want to see him. But, he finally moved out. I was so excited to see the moving truck near his house. I don’t have to hire a lawn crew anymore and I don’t have to take the long route walking to try and avoid this person. I am very excited and happy. I haven’t done my own yard work for a long time and I feel very good. 🥰"
happy,"I think I’ve done really well. I’ve been with my beautiful wife for 30 years, my two children are loved, well adjusted, educated and emotionally whole. I am financially stable, in love, calm and have the family of my dreams. I have burnt a lot of bridges removing myself from narcissistic parents and siblings, doing everything I can to break the cycle of toxicity and destruction. Both my wife and I are true survivors and are each other’s best friends."
happy,"After 3 years of trying and IVF I'm now in my 28th week of pregnancy. 

My contract at work is ending before I go on maternity leave and I can't wait to have extra time to do all kinds of stuff for baby and the house in general. 

My husband is amazing and supportive in every way imaginable. 

My relationship with my parents have strengthened over the last couple of years and especially now that I'm pregnant. 

My friends write to me often even if we don't have as much time to see each other as we would like. 

I'm so happy I could burst with joy and gratitude. 

I wish everyone could feel this feeling but I'm scared if I talk too much about all the good things in my life it would come of as bragging?

Does anyone else have these thoughts?
How should I deal with it?

Thank you in advance and sorry for formatting I'm on my phone. "
happy,"A while ago I wanted to download a game from my childhood because I remember really liking the music. I'm waaay too old for anything in it of course and don't have kids but I wrote a review baisicly saying that it made my childhood and that even though I've grown out of it I still adore it. I checked today and found out that the creator of the game wrote back a review saying ""We were so pleased! We are extremely glad that we brought happiness to your childhood! This is our goal! Thank you very much for these words on behalf of the whole team! Be healthy!"" (Translated from bulgarian). Actually crying tears of joy this was so sweet."

So i am 18m a okay looking guy i would say. I have been going to the gym for about 2 years. Last sommer i start going 5 times a week.

A bit about me i am a stupid guy never been smart was fat as a kid. I work in connection. And this guy looks op to me!

Just want to say it told my mom she didn't care 
"
happy,"I spent eight years in an incredibly abusive relationship. Emotionally, mentally, and physically. I was devalued every step of the way and never realized that there were people taking advantage of me. But about two years ago I found people who actually love and care about me, realized my family loves me and that I was being lied to that they didn't. The people who used me did and still will claim I'm a failure, but they wouldn't be where they are without me. But more importantly, I've now surrounded myself with smart, empathetic, kind, successful people and my heart is full of happiness and love now because of it. I have a wonderful relationship, a successful career, and so much to look forward to. I'm so lucky to have what I have now. I'm so happy that I left and can now be a better person for it. I have so much hope for the future that I could never have had before, and I look forward to all of the happiness and success waiting for me now that I've moved on to better things."
happy,"Pretty rainy today but that ain't stopping me! Walked the same distance as yesterday but I'll try another mile in a week or so! I appreciate the support of making this a daily thing and i also appreciate all of you who have ""joined"" me in my walking! Love y'all and I'll see you tomorrow!"
happy,"Hey all! I've been on the weightloss train for nearly 3-4 years now! I am only 5',3"", so at my biggest of 215lbs, I was quite heavy for my size. 
I began to simply just eat less, take in less sugar, reduce my portions, and begin walking (10k steps a day). 
Towards the end of my journey I began running and working out as well, which helped me over come plateaus, as well as reducing sugar to nearly 0. 
I am now 120lbs. I may lose 5 more pounds to be 115lbs, but we'll see. It took me nearly half a decade, but I can rest now knowing it is finally accomplished! "
happy,"My mom has been a green thumb enthusiasts. Her garden is a beautiful mess with half edibles and flowers and it's a little slice of her happy place.


But she has always been strictly a roses, carnations and dahlias only gardener with the odd daisy, marigold or iris thrown in. Wildflowers to her were the equivalent of weeds (lol).


A few weeks ago, I had been feeling down and I saw a video of a wildflower meadow that looked stunning. I mentioned to my mum about how happy they made me due to the bright colors, the bees and butterflies it attracted. That's it, that's all I said. She nodded and didn't say much. 


Well this morning I saw the tall grassy patch she had left to 'recover and compost' before she planted veg in had wildflowers. 


She seeded the bare patch for me without asking. Just because it made me happy. It made me feel so loved in that moment. Mom cares. She heard and saw what I was feeling and decided to build me a small wildflower patch so I could sit outside and escape my depression.


After years of a rocky relationship, we are finally building a solid foundation with wildflowers."
happy,"SO and I are gen x, come from suuuuuper broken homes. We met just over ten years ago, are celebrating our 9th wedding anniversary today. We’re having Jimmy John’s to celebrate while we save money for the move. 

He comes from the troubled teen industry, I come from your standard fucked up adolescence. 

We’ve been apartment dwellers since we met and have talked about a house but it had to be damn near perfect to make us commit. It was a long distance dream we clung to in our darkest hours. 

We found one.  Georgian Colonial, made from brick. It’s gonna last generations, like us. It has a small waterfall in the backyard, only a few neighbors, lots of trees and privacy. The Seller sat on the house until he found the “right” buyers and it turns out that was us. We got one hell of a deal. We’re paying less than half a mil for a house that’s worth 3/4 of a mil easily. 

We don’t feel like we deserve it but we’re damned if we won’t enjoy it. 

I’m a firm believer that the Universe gives you what you need. Not god, not fate, but something similar. I don’t know, but it seems like there was a time we needed something, and it’s been provided, and it’s not the first time. 

We needed a larger apartment? One was open in the same complex. We needed a family type car? First one we looked at was perfect. SO’s job sucked monkey balls? Here’s a random call about one and oh, hey, we’ll pay to interview and move you … 

We’re just so fucking happy right now and it sucks to share that with friends and family who aren’t necessarily feeling it. 

I wish I could share this feeling with all of you.

happy,"There isn’t much that brings me pleasure anymore but i am so grateful for warm blankets. I just put a blanket in the drier until it was warmed up, i took it out and laid under it for a few seconds and it was one of the most pleasurable things I have ever felt in my life. I just felt so safe, so comforted and loved and even though i was completely alone i didn’t feel like it at all. All of the tension in my body just completely went away and breathing became so easy, my lungs felt so open and every time i breathed i could feel my breath traveling throughout my whole body. The pleasurable sensation that started in my chest began to expand, until it expanded to the blanket itself. I didn’t even feel like a separate entity anymore, nothing was separate, all that exists is warmth, and every aspect of my surroundings including myself is a part of the Great Warmness. I was so affectionate i started smiling so intensely and i felt so happy i started crying in the middle of nowhere. It was beautiful. Why is a heated piece of cloth capable of this?? Even though it only lasts a few seconds, it makes everything around me seem perfect and it makes everything seem okay. It’s the only friend i have. I love the warmth of heated blankets so much and i am so thankful for its sweet embrace, i don’t deserve it at all"

Because I'm chronically online, I would call her immature, lazy, boot licking capitalist because this is the only place I've been on vacation. She just told me this will probably be our last trip together since I'm getting older and graduating soon. I started crying uncontrollably because I realized this is our happy place. This is OUR special place we make memories. I'm constantly surrounding myself around miserable people because of my mental health conditions alongside me being queer. There is beauty in traditions and my momma loves me so much and more than anything in the world."
happy,"
I met this girl two months ago online and I really adore how quickly and how mutually we have gotten close to one another, despite the fact that we started off as simply friends. It happened so naturally that it really felt magical in a way, none of it being forced, its like there was an unspoken agreement that we would be together lol.
She lives abroad, a timezone away, but I still cannot help but feel sure about here and I will get to pay her a visit really soon :).
And she really is the sweetest person I have ever met. She is respectful and caring to the point that it feels impossible for her to ever step beyond my boundaries, always being reassuring to even just remove possible wrong impressions of anything that might make me feel bad. We are capable of talking about any topic without disagreement and any worry without feeling unheard or judged. She started learning my entire language just for me (🥺) and she did not miss practicing it for a single day. I wish I could return the favor but I already know English lol. Shes really the best and she puts so much effort into being so that I dont think that will ever change. I hope I can be there for here whenever she needs it and I hope that she always feels how much I value her. I would take an oath to never stop taking her on dates if I could right now, regardless of what age we may reach together. And she looks so cute too like oml I physically melt when I see her smile, I really cant mess this up guys wish me luck lol."
happy,"I shouldn’t be writing this since I’m about to go to bed

  
But sitting at my work desk I was feeling a little stressed about life

  
But something made it all go away

  
I closed my eyes… and starting imagining

  
Imaging my future

  
A future where I’m with my future daughter and I’m pushing her on a swing

  
She’s smiling so much and laughing and calling me daddy.

  
\-you can make it weird, but honestly it was super cute

  
I could clearly see her face so happy

  
Then another time

  
We’re at the beach and she’s older, a teenager

  
And the next scene I’m on my death bed with 5-7 kids around me

  
I’m smiling and they’re crying

  
In the present, the me who is sitting at my work desk is also smiling befause I’ve realised

  
There is no reason to be stressed

  
Thjngs can’t be bad forever, they never are, the only way to make it out of a stressful situation is to keep going and having hope.

  
Key lesson: start doing positive future visualisations when you’re lost.

  
They’ll change your life  
I hope this post is valuable to anyone feeling lost.

I've had it in my mind for a while now that I need to take a lengthy tolerance break. Whenever my weed is about to run out I tell myself that this is it and that once it's gone I would begin a several month long break.

What always happens is I will smoke my last bowl and then find myself walking over to the dispensary that's literally a two minute walk away and buying another ounce. Last night I finished smoking my supply and I didn't buy more. I didn't buy any today either. The dispensary closes in 13 minutes and that will make it official.

For the first time in probably five years, I chose not to smoke weed. Tiny milestone, but tomorrow I will abstain again, and the next day, and the next, and the next."

This was after my ex-boyfriend and I broke up a few weeks before (we were together 4 years but it had been over a year that it wasn't working out. I don't want comments on this, you'll understand why later).

I have a lot of anxiety around relationships. My ex verbally abused me for the first part of our relationship, and then he was never physically there because he had to stay back home for understandable reasons. I was unhappy. I did things that hurt him too, and I've looked into why I did what I did and am learning to overcome what happened between us (the things he used to say to me in anger outbursts).

Now I've been friends with my girlfriend for 3 ish years now. I always thought she was so gorgeous and funny. I got to spending more time with her and next thing I knew, I was falling in love. I don't know what I did to get so lucky. Whenever I come forward about my feelings about something, she NEVER gets mad at me. She's so calm, so chill. She reassures me gently, and listens to me while explaining to me why this is okay, that I am valid. When I'm down for whatever reason, she makes me laugh without a problem. I can do anything with her and we can make it fun! I laugh harder with her than anyone else. She engages in things that I like and genuinely enjoys them, and vice versa.

The other day, we were snuggling and chatting in bed. I don't remember what she said, but it really hit home and I just felt my eyes start to water. She asked me what was wrong, and I just looked at her and said ""I just realized how unsafe I felt in the world before you"". She smiled and pulled me in, she let me cry on her for a few seconds.

She lets me talk about my ex and what happened. She knows I'm far from romantically or sexually interested in him anymore. She's so kind about the fact that I do miss him sometimes as a friend (I mean, 4 years with someone and talking almost every day is hard to let go of). I don't think about it often, really. She lets me talk about the things he did/said to me that hurt me deeply. I mean even yesterday we were talking about some of the horrible things he said and she looked at me and said ""I want to show you what a soft love looks like."" I just stared at her in awe and shock. I was frozen in place, just...speechless. She makes it safe for me to express excitement about things I love, she doesn't judge me for the things I enjoy, and SHE DOESN'T GET MAD AT ME!!! She doesn't insult me beyond what we both agree are jokes, she gently redirects me towards healthier behaviors for my mental health and for the relationship, we're both working together to be healthy and I just...wow....She's even coming home with me for Easter weekend (we don't celebrate but hey, why not).

I'm beyond happy with her. Maybe it's too soon to tell, I don't know, but I want to marry her someday. I really think this is it, that she's my future wife. She's currently asleep in my bed. I want her to be my love for the rest of our lives. She is truly and unequivocally the most beautiful person I've ever met (inside and out). I can't see a day where I don't find her funny anymore, where I don't find her attractive anymore, where I don't want to run to her to tell her about my day. I want to share my world with her. She's my best friend and more. I've never been happier, and I've never felt more like me.

If you read this whole thing, thank you so much :) I know it's a lot, it's messy, and honestly I can't even say everything I feel about this woman because I just don't have the words to express the deep, honest love I have for her. I wish you all the most WONDERFUL day!"
happy,I've literally been praying for this for two years straight ever since the post-credits scene in Sonic Movie 2. The fact that this is actually happening after all that is so blissful
happy,"Guys... I told my crush he's got a cute smile

So, here's how the conversation went: we were walking out of class together, it's the last day of the semester before I can't see him again, and we had this activity where we needed to compliment someone about them. 

We were walking out of class, and I told him: your smile is so, so contagious, Annd immediately he smiles incredibly wide at me, his two small dimples on the sides of his lips show, and it was the cutest thing ever, and super rewarding. Then we walk past a classroom with his friend in it, which he interrupts me, but my crush goes:

""SHUT UP, she's SPEAKING. Continue, please, continue."" So I do, but I tell him that.""Yeah, yeah, I know I'm boosting your ego, but it's like- actually super amazing, and..."" To which my face is pratically melting off, which he points out, telling me my cheeks are beet red.
Then says: 

""It's kinda hot, ngl"" I wasn't sure whether he said, ""Your face is super hot red,"" I was too dizzy from the amount of blush on my face. 

Then I told him it was just adorable and how I was gonna miss it. He's full-on grinning now before he begins to leave. AHHHHHHHHHG"
happy,"My boyfriend and I were cuddling yesterday and he told me he wants to be the father of my kids one day. I’ve always wanted a loving and respectful man who would want something long-term with me and I also aspire to be a mother who raises a cute lil family of my own one day, so I was squealing on the inside when he told me this :) I hope everyone and anyone can experience love as amazing as this if not better 🥰"
happy,"2 years ago, when I told my family and friends I wanted to release all original music as a fully independent artist, and try to turn it into a full time living, almost everyone I knew didn’t believe I’d get very far… I know realistically the vast majority of people that try don’t get far, so I could understand where they were coming from (the music industry is insanely hard to make a living in). But I would never know if I didn’t try…So I did. And I worked so hard, and so many times I asked myself why I was doing this…So many times I wanted to give up. But looking at this milestone, I feel very happy and proud that I didn’t give up. I’m also earning a decent part time income from my music too! The next goal is full time! Just thought I’d share this, and to not give up on your dreams if you truly love doing them! :)
"
happy,"I love him so very, very much."
happy,"What's so special about an office snack drawer?

It sounds funny but I have dreamed of having my own snack drawer at my own desk in my own office for as long as I can remember.  While I may not have my own office, I have a nice cubicle next to a large set of windows in the corner of the building.  It's wonderful!

I spent the better part of a decade getting an undergraduate engineering degree and graduated at 33 while working to support myself and doing extracurricular projects.  There were so many times I just wanted to quit.  I moved around a lot and changed majors at one point so it took a while to get through it all but I did it.  I now work for a company that I've always wanted to work for and I have myself a snack drawer.

It's silly but this snack drawer reminds me of all the blood, sweat, and tears that went into getting my degree and I just feel so accomplished when I turn around, open it, and grab some crackers.  I've come so far since I was waiting tables with no direction in life and it's a nice reminder that all the hard work paid off.  I can't help but smile when I think about it.  Lmao, sounds so weird typing it out but it makes me so happy!"
happy,Started the year making better changes. Ive lost 19lbs in total since January.
happy,I felt so happy to see nature and these ducks. 
happy,"So I've worked for getting on 6 years now 

Been senior support for about 3-4 years. Which involves working 24 hour shifts 

For the last year or so I've been doing a lot of the manager work without the extra pay, this is because the current deputy was not really able to do the tasks 

Well I was having a bit of a moan over the Easter bank holidays because I had finished three 24 hour shifts when the regional manager started sending me a series of tasks for some reason (my bosses boss) and I did it all promptly while moaning at myself for being a push over 

Turns out the regional manager then asked my boss why I'm not the deputy as I seem better for the role.

This lead to a discussion with the current deputy who said that she is more than happy to step down from the position for me to take over 


So I'm happy to have gotten recognition from someone high up the chain but also I will now only be working one 24 hour shift a week and will have 16 hours office hours throughout the week 

Also I still get a pay rise of course aha "
happy,"I'm a 30yr old woman and I've never really played with Legos before. My husband is an avid Lego lover, both as a kid and as an adult, and has recently wanted to get back into building them. 

I know there have been some really cool sets to come out in the past couple of years (some look like flowers or little zen gardens or insects one might pin, etc) so when he got himself a set today I also looked. I found this darling little bonsai tree and he offered to get it for me so we could build together! 

We both put ours together tonight and it was so much fun! I didn't realize that the cherry blossoms were actually little pink frogs until I got to that section. My little bonsai is chilling with its adorable little pink frogs on my counter and I could not be more pleased!

And for anyone wondering, hubby got himself the Thanos glove and he is pleased as punch! 😊"

happy,"It looks like no big thing, normal achievements for most people, but 2 years ago I was depressed, no job, no money, no friends, single, my mental health wasn't good at all. Now I'm working, I have a job, I met a girl that I really like, she became my girlfriend, and I started to work out, I've gained a few pounds, my physique looks better now.

I'm really proud of myself and feeling happy. I felt like sharing it because depressed people can change their life for the better, it's not easy but it's possible!"
happy,"I have always worked construction and trades jobs my whole life but a few years ago I took a leap and decided to do something with my creative side. It has always been my dream to work in a creative field as I’ve always loved art and design. So I’ve been going to university for graphic design for the past two years online. I’ve been working meaningless part time jobs in retail and maintenance to pay my bills while going to school. 

A little while ago my friend gave me a tip that his company was hiring and it’s in the industry. Long story short I beat the other applicants and was hired!!! I am now a layout editor for a media company. I specialize in newspaper page layouts. For the first time in my life I’m actually making a living wage and can afford to live normally. Nothing fancy but I’m doing more than just surviving now. I couldn’t be happier. Follow your dreams kids!!"
happy,"This morning I was going to work and it was dark but I saw my bf pass me on the highway on our way to work, I instantly got butterflies. Then when I got to the Dunkin drive thru who do I see in front of me….. it’s him. Lol I didn’t think he would notice but then when I got to the window to pay for my coffee the cashier said “here you go. The gentleman in front of you already paid” it’s the little things. y’all I’m so in love 🥰 "
happy,"My mum has always been big into sewing and is much better at it than I am, I lost my quilt when I was 19 and we had a flood and it broke my heart because I was planning on passing it onto my daughter. But out of the blue this arrived. My daughter loves it and it's an absolutely gorgeous quilt. It looks like it took an insane amount of time (from all the different patches, edging and lining I'd estimate about 30 hours) and it's got a whole story that my mum wrote out by hand. The nostalgia, happiness at seeing my daughters joy and appreciation for the effort my mum went to for her granddaughter has made me the most proud and happy son/father "
happy,"In my 30’s, yesterday on my second attempt, I passed my driving test. It still feels like a fever dream and still can’t believe it actually happened but I did it. 

I never thought I would get behind the wheel of a car. Fear and anxiety being a factor but something has always gotten in the way any time I thought about it over the years.

I am so proud of myself for doing something entirely outside of my comfort zone and gaining new independence. 

Happy is an understatement."
happy,"There's this old couple in our hood, Mr. and Mrs. Johnson. Super cute. Mr. J decided to recreate their first date for Mrs. J. Picnic in the backyard, candles, the whole deal. Mrs. J walks in, totally surprised and thrilled.

They spend the evening laughing, reminiscing, just being adorable. Now here's the cool part – word gets out, and suddenly, the whole neighborhood catches this happy bug.

People start doing little nice things for each other – helping out, checking in. It's like Mr. J's love move sparked this happiness wave in the community.

Lesson learned? A bit of love goes a long way. One sweet gesture can set off a whole chain of good vibes. Who knew a recreated first date could kickstart a happiness epidemic, right? "
happy,"Today I turned 33.  My boyfriend (33M) decided to take me on a small trip to a forest an hour away that he knows is one of my favourite places. 
Things were weird between us the the last couples of weeks but I was happy that we took the trip.
We walked through the woods and I was walking ahead of him and he called out my name. I asked him whatif everything is okay while still looking straight ahead. He asked me to turn around. There he was, holding a ring in his hands, smiling at me and he popped the question. 
I said yes. 
I still can't believe it happened .
I can't believe I'm saying this but I'm engaged and this is most definitely the best birthday I've ever had."
happy,"At 9:56 am today my boyfriend (m23) of 4 years and I (f21) both randomly  texted each other ""I love you ❤️"" while we were apart and it just made me smile. I was in my social work course watching a mock therapy group and one of the girls said her partner is her comfort person and I thought of him because he's mine. He told me that ""dreams"" by the cranberries was playing at his work (🥺) and it reminded him of me (omfg I'm winning). Life is funny and this just really reminded me that there are people who love you and think about you even when you're not around. "
happy,"i'm going home and i'm so happy!

So for some context, I moved out to attend university over 6 months ago. It has been a tough but enjoyable experience so far and i have learnt many new things and made some new friends. Not a bad experience at all. However, i haven't seen my family and my cat (my pride and joy) since i left and i dearly miss them.

Today, my mom and i booked me a flight back home to visit for a whole month. I am so happy that i am full on happy sobbing. It doesn't seem like that much of a big deal, but it is to me and i am beyond excited!"
happy,"Hope my cat can brighten your day

My cat always brightens my day every day she brings a smile to my face , every day she brings a smile to my face

I hope this nice picture of her can also brighten your day. She is such a loving cat.

Hope you have all had a great day"
happy,"
Started a new job in February and became fast friends with Amanda. Her friendship means the world to me. Even though she is 18 years younger than me. We just love being friends. Yesterday we got our nails done and had dinner and drinks. 
I laughed so much my cheeks hurt. ☺️😊
We even got drinks that look like us 😂🤣"
happy,"Over 2 years ago, a friend of ours passed away leaving 3 kids orphaned and a half sibling without a support system. My wife and I took in all 4 kids, as we were quite close with the kids. We got legal guardianship of the 2 youngest about 6 months after they moved in. The youngest is now 10. She started calling my wife ""Mommy"" about a year ago. This took some getting used to as all of our other kids call her ""Mom"". 

I however, remained Mr. MyFirstName. She has never had a dad before, and she had always called me that before she moved in. She gives me hugs everyday (now) and tells me she loves me frequently (yes, I know this won't last). So I was not worried about what she calls me. We went on a trip with my brother and his family, and sometime during the week, she just started calling me ""Daddy"". I'm not sure if it was because her cousin (my niece - 6F) calls my brother Daddy (a lot) or what caused it. At one point, we were at a theme park, and she was calling me Daddy over and over again, and I completely missed it, because I wasn't used to it and her voice is similar to my niece. My SIL grabs my arm and says ""Daddy!!!  Someone is calling you"". I felt awful, and so overjoyed at the same time. We've been home several days and I'm still Daddy (and getting used to it), but also Mr. MyFirstName sometimes too, but it still makes me smile.

  
We are hoping the adoption will be finalized this year. "
happy,"A few weeks ago I won sole custody of my 3 kids from an abusive drug addicted ex. Today she signed the final modification of custody with a notary and everything.

happy,"A day ago I posted about how happy and excited I was that I made a plan to visit my boyfriend suddenly! And he was surprised a lot! But today he surprised me back by proposing me 😅🥺 So apparently he had plans to propose me before but the ring wasn’t delivered on time , so he was planning to propose me later this month. But since I visited him suddenly, he took this opportunity to surprise me back by taking out the ring at this magical hike we had today. This is probably the best thing ever happened to me, the uno reverse we all need in life ! 😭🤍✌️"
happy,"...Say Yes to the Dress! I've watched it before and it's always been a blast, but in the last two days I've been watching SYTTD Australia and Atlanta, and it's exactly what I need right now. So many happy and funny moments and it's just warm feeling to watch people embark on new incredible journeys, even when so much else feels like it's ending.

I love sharing joys and wins with people, and being able to do that with people I'll never meet is really filling a hole in my soul right now."
happy,"My absolute angel of a mother in law and I are taking my future sister in law to a little tea house as surprise! We just told her to be ready to go at a certain time and have sworn all the boys to secrecy 😊. 

Mother in law, future sister in law and I really love tea so I really hope she likes it. Both of these ladies are absolute gems to be around and I cannot be more excited to have my future sister in law join the family ❤️. She is so sweet and considerate and sassy and I love her so much! And mother in law is an absolute doll. Anything and everything she can do to help, she'll do. She's a tiny spit fire of a woman and won't hesitate to show you what-for like she's 8 feet tall lol. 

My blood family has never treated me half as well as these ladies do and I am just so blessed to know them and have them in my life! 

So here's to a sneaky surprise!  *shush* no telling!🤫

Edit: She loved it and no one spilled the beans! We got to have a lovely little tea time with some wonderful conversation and some very delicious tea, yummy pastries and little finger sandwiches! She's actually thinking about using the location for her bridal shower 😊"

Rarely do I actually worry about the cost but at the moment I am in a pickle. I then went home and spent a few hours replacing the ballast on my busted headlight. I showered, and am now in bed just happy. I’ve been the “fix it” ticket guy at the court house and I just don’t want to continue bothering the police department with my lack of due diligence for my slowly ailing car. Luckily I didn’t get any infractions for the headlight out but it works now! It’s a nice car for me, unfortunately it’s just so old and I am not financially ahead enough on everything to pay the amount it needs; that’s why I work on it myself.

I guess I'm just trying to put some good vibes for myself out on a night where I feel rather low. I honestly didn't think I could get this far but since February I've lost 32lbs according to my scale this morning. It's probably more once I poop...if I poop."
happy,"when i think about the definition of love, i see him and all he does for me"
happy,"There used to be a falling down house across the street from me. Some realtor picked it up on a property tax sale and tore it down. Should have been no big deal and just a normal tear down and rebuild, right? Along the way, I noticed it was taking forever to build 2 homes they decided to build on the lot. It's been almost 2 years since construction started, 1 house is complete, the 2nd is about half finished. I'm home with a work injury, so there isn't much else to watch but this build and the boob tube. And of course, my dogs go berserk whenever people show up over there.

Dogs are going off one day and I look to see what set them off. It's a mold abatement company. I didn't really think too much of it, and a year passed before the house was complete. My friend tells me after she has signed the contract that she's moving across the street from me. That's when the alarm bells went off in my head. I let her know to be thorough in her inspection because they'd already treated this brand-new home for mold. Her jaw hits the floor, and she says that the owner/realtor (both are the same person) didn't disclose that.

There are other problems, like none of the dirt from digging in water lines, nor any gravel in preparation for driveways and sidewalks being compacted. None of the cement has rebar to reinforce and strengthen it to stand up to our winters. The un-compacted water line trenches run under both driveways. I guess hauling off piles of dirt wasn't a clue to the builder that it might be a problem later.

Final inspection day comes, and it takes 2 pry bars operated by 2 fairly large men to get the access to the crawl space open because it's so wet in the crawl space it has made the wood swell quite a bit. Not only is the crawlspace infested with mold, but against code, the crawl space wasn't built with any ventilation. So my friend got out of the contract, and the owner/realtor will likely lose her real estate license for not making proper disclosures.

Yes, it sucks that she has to look for another house, but she's so happy she didn't get stuck in a mold infested trap. And funnily enough, you can hear fans running from over there 24/7 in both houses."

happy,Me and my wife have been together 20 years in October and married 16 in November. As long as I've known her she's been a smoker. I was a smoker myself. I finally kicked the habit three years ago. Bur my wife has been incredibly stubborn on the subject. Today we talked for a while and she decided to take steps to quit. I couldn't be happier with this decision. I'm aware that this will not he easy but she's at least willing. And I'm gonna stand by her and take all the crap that comes with quitting.

This means I have to get up and out to walk him first thing, something that I COULD NOT and WOULD NOT ever do before I had him because of my agoraphobia.

happy,"Has a sad start, but trust me it’s really nice once you read it all.


Long story short many years ago I had a lot of falling out with people I cared about. All my fault. Since then I thought of myself as a horrible person due to the guilt and shame. Lead me down a dark road. Even tried to kill myself in 2022 due to it all since it was getting harder and harder to handle. 

Last night I decided to reach out on social media to one of them who I had falling out with in 2019. He accepted the apology. He even said everything was alright. How he moved on for everything, and then we wished each other well.

This came to a shock to me. Honestly I thought he was gonna get angry at me, but no. Was very sweet really. 

The next morning I decided to reach out to anyone else I could to apologize, to forgive them, or just to send thanks. Really was a great feeling to do. Gave myself closure and even them if they needed it. Plus, I think it was good for me to thank the people in my life who treated me well too. 

Some haven’t responded or even said much, but that doesn’t matter. My actions I took made me forgive myself regardless. 

I feel so much peace. Serenity and contempt all over my body. Almost as if a giant weight was lifted from my body and now the wound is stitched and healed. 

Can’t remember the last time I felt like this. It’s a beautiful feeling and I hope get to experience it too. "

happy,I'm a passionate and disabled bilingual preschool teacher with a resilient spirit. Overcame adversity after losing my left hand in an accident at age 12. I have finally launched my first children's book on Kickstarter. I'm quite excited.
happy,Mum has been helping me orchestrate so she knows I'm coming back- I haven't seen my family since Christmas and I've especially missed my little sister so I decided instead of staying at uni for reading week I'm gonna go home and surprise her!
happy,"Yesterday, a mysterious someone left this poster and a bucket of flowers. The number of people walking around with flowers was astounding. Plenty of folks in my hometown needed a little happiness. :)"
happy,"Made me happy, They seem happy. I'm filming the wild monkeys that frequent my garden and was surprised with how quickly doing this brought joy to my life...only thing is I am a bit attached now.

happy,Got boba and a sandwich from my favorite Vietnamese fusion place to celebrate!
happy,"I was scrolling through Reddit and came across a video of this tiny dog carrying an abnormally large stick, maybe even a branch in his mouth, waddling around with it as he tried to balance himself, it was absolutely adorable! I love dogs, man <3"
happy,"* hang out with people you love. go out, get drunk, have fun. everything in moderation hehe
* touch people. hugs, touches, pets, holding hands, squeezes, cuddles... EVERYTHING
* talk to people. open up. it's okay to allow yourself to be held by the people you want to be cared by. *it's okay to have the selfish desire to be burdensome*. it is OKAY! keep moving. never stay in one place too long (small and large scale). *comfort is the foil of growth.*
* exercise. even if you don't feel like going, just do 15 minutes. the rest will come. and I KNOW you always feel better after moving. whether it be a walk after dinner, a gym run, or even a a simple stretch outside. 
* always push yourself. no matter how hard it seems, you can always go further. one extra lap, minute, or rep... just that extra breath of effort will push you boundlessly. you will realize you can overcome the goals you set for yourself, which slowly seep into the rest of your life. 
* correct negative thoughts gently. when you feel hateful, reflect on your own thoughts. why are you being mean? your inner thoughts heavily influence your perspective on the outer world. humans are creatures of projection, so PLEASE be kind to yourself and others.
* eat breakfast. even if you don't think you want to. a coffee, a fruit, or a slice of bread. I promise that extra boost of energy is worth it. 
* talk to people that make you happy. keep the company of people who uplift you. keep those who support you, purge the ones who denounce you. *may the bridges you burn light the way!* 
* talk less, act more. for me, actions have always spoken louder than words. making less excuses and just doing things will help propel your plot. 
* MUSIC. listen to it, play it, learn it, make it, worship it. make playlists, sing songs, listen with people. it's the best thing to boost you up and feel understood when no one else understands. (the best part about music is there's so freaking much of it you can't possibly find something you don't like)
* question your perspective to the world. think of the external and internal causes that lead you to your beliefs. learn to question EVERYTHING, but keep a grounding foot on your intuition as well.
* don't overthink. if you're self conscious about it, they probably are too. no one is focusing on your faults. you are your biggest critic! 
* you get out what you put out and that's that!

***\* DISCLAIMER: \****

this is the unsolicited advice of a (highly opinionated) 22F yr old onliner, so take everything with a grain of salt. this just happens to be a helpful guide i keep in my notes app and wanted to share. 

on paper, i have no impressive concrete accomplishments in my life. i am a classic instance of a burnt-out-gifted-kid turned college drop out. so, if you would like to tell me i am living my life wrong, go ahead. 

i am quite content. 

i have spent a lot of  time trying to find that sense of normalcy we've all been aching for since graduating high school. it felt like i would never experience that grandiose feeling of truly ""living in the moment"" and ""seeing in color"" again.  i wished the world would pause for me just once. just to allow me to relive a core memory from my childhood again. but alas, that nostalgic relief never comes... 

because truly, life goes on, and it never stops. 

to some, it might sound harsh, but i interpret it as a comfort saying. accepting that ""it is what it is"" but ""what ***will*** be, is in my hands"", is the most important takeaway. 

ultimately, there is no ""cure"" or solution to find happiness. it comes and goes, wanes and rises, just as the moon and the sun! if you remember the world always has balance, whether it be spiritually, mentally, or physically, you begin to understand that 

spread kindness and patience, or don't. it is up to you do as you please! just remember to challenge yourself always, and truly focus with intention.

happy,Definitely going to start buying these to give as gifts! It also smells absolutely lovely. :)
happy,"I'm an artist in NYC and the last several months have been brutally slow. After a lot of exhausting work, and serious anxiety about what they would say, not 1 but both people who reached out to me said they were going through with their purchases!!! I am soooooo happy and relieved!!! I'll be taking myself out to dinner tomorrow to celebrate 🥳 🎉  The first painting was called ""A Summer Daydream"" and the second was ""Health, Wealth, Prosperity."" Both acrylic on canvas and lots of love! Cheers to a great new year!! ✨️🥰✨️"
happy,"The last time I went to the beach was last year, I really miss the sand and the sound of the sea, it's like therapy for me, I hope to go again soon, it's something that's makes me super happy, here I'm manifesting my next beach trip "
happy,"I've been pretty depressed for several month and I just started to get better. I've develloped a crush on a old schoolmate that is really beautiful and out of my league, but I'm not pessimistic of my chances.

We talk a little bit on instagram. Nothing more nothing less. It is nice even tho nothing is really happening.
I didn't saw her in real life for like 3 years. Only on social medias

This morning I took the Subway to go to work and I saw her in the train. God she was beautiful !
She left after just 4 stations but that was such a cool moment for me.
Nothing happened, but just the fact that I got the opportunity to see her in real life made that day a bit better :)"
happy,"I hope he was talking about post-serum! 

But in all seriousness, made my day. When kids are nice, it just seems so genuine. Same kid also asked me if I was a D1 basketball player while I was shooting around (I’m not even close!)

Anyway, it just made me happy."
happy,"We’ve had some pretty intense rain, heat and humidity over the past few weeks where I live, and it resulted in my garden going absolutely nuts with weeds. There wasn’t much I could do because it was either raining or so hot I would get heat stroke if I tried. So the last three days i spent a couple of hours each (still in the 30s Celsius) pulling the weeds. The first photo was taken after I had already pulled two garbage bags of weeds from the edge of the concreted space."
happy,"So basically I (20 M) have lost a shit ton of weight from say weighing 120 kilograms to right now weighing 83 kgs. I regularly go to the gym and I have them muscles too. There's just one teeny tiny issue. I was a hell of a glutton when I was chubby, and that habit still persists in the form of my sweet tooth and binge eating, though not often. 
Today, particularly, I'd eaten more than I'm supposed to, on my calorie deficit, by say 200-300 kcals, and all the PTSD came rushing to my head. I know it's not healthy, but this does not happen often. Okay so, my girlfriend rudely cut my video call cause her friend called and the girls had a nice time putting on face masks and stuff (when my girl (19 F) had told me before that she would do that with me on video call, while we talk.) So obviously this made me feel bad, and along with the PTSD, made my emotions avalanche down the fkin mountain. 
Cue me calling my girl a bit later, she goes ""tell me what's the matter"" in the most bored voice ever. I couldn't stop myself, tears started flowing down my eyes. I didn't know how to tell her what the matter was, and that made my emotions plummet even more.
However, after a while, I gathered composure, told my girlfriend the reasons, that I missed my father, and my grandmothers every single day, think about the days they were alive, and that I get motivation from them, to succeed. I told her about the PTSD regarding my body image issues, and what I consider as freedom from this: I want to be able to rip of my shirt and wear shorts without worrying about my physique whatsoever. (Not to mention I want that athletic physique and am working towards it). 
Where I knew that I'd won, with her as my girlfriend, is when she listened through everything, then at the end, told me stuff I exactly wanted to hear. That how she'd shown a pump picture of mine to one of her guy friends and how the guy praised my physique, how she'd storied a picture of me with a beautiful Persian cat (she was absolutely wonderful, the cat) on instagram, and how her friend replied ""Where were such beautiful and wonderful guys when I was searching for them? What kinda black magic did you perform that suddenly you get such a great guy to be your boyfriend?"". I feel absolutely elated right now.
There was this day I wore a semi-transparent shirt out, and my girl said today: listen babe, yk, I know we went to a temple that day but I could not help thinking unholy shit to do to you.
I am so fucking happy right now. i hope I marry this girl someday."
happy,So today I went for a run. Now when I starred I was doing interval training which I still do but today I made through half my route without getting winded or slowing down to walk. I feel amazing. I'm so happy when I make progress. 
happy,"I was tired of my life. I woke up one day and realized I have been “winging” it and “half-assing” through life. I’m not in a terrible place. I have a decent paying management job in infrastructure. But this wasn’t the life young me wanted.

I got accepted in college and I’m about to start classes. I scored insanely well on the accuplacer (after countless hours studying). And the end goal is to finally pursue my dream and become a lawyer. It was my dream all as a child. But I spent too much time in high school skipping class and hitting the reefer. I graduated high school with a 2.0 GPA. I didn’t even understand math at all. I had Fs in every math class. But I self taught my self advance algebra and statistics in a matter of weeks before my test. And I’m so proud of that. (I was proud when I was doing 7th grade math test and passing lol) 

I’m sharing on here because I’m divorced and kinda alone. No one is by my side to share the joy with me. And all my coworkers laughed at me and one of my coworkers (who dropped out in 7th grade) keeps telling me how dumb I am for doing it. I just wanted to get it off my chest in a safe area because I’m genuinely stoked. 

This is a massive vent and humble brag. "
happy,"Recovery has been really rough, but I'm so proud of myself for driving and going out today, even just for a few minutes!"
happy,"I have the best in-laws, they spoil me more than their own son! I volunteer at a pig sanctuary, so when my MIL saw this she said she just had to get it for me. I’m so lucky 🥰"
happy,"I really love him. I spent forever putting his gift together and when I finally gave it to him seeing him cry made me so happy. He said he’s never been loved like this before and that he loves me more than anything. 

I’m just so so happy I get to make him feel loved cause he makes me feel so safe and loved too. I’m not so great with my words like he is but I think this really showed him how I feel :)"
happy,"My absolute angel of a mother in law and I are taking my future sister in law to a little tea house as surprise! We just told her to be ready to go at a certain time and have sworn all the boys to secrecy 😊. 

Mother in law, future sister in law and I really love tea so I really hope she likes it. Both of these ladies are absolute gems to be around and I cannot be more excited to have my future sister in law join the family ❤️. She is so sweet and considerate and sassy and I love her so much! And mother in law is an absolute doll. Anything and everything she can do to help, she'll do. She's a tiny spit fire of a woman and won't hesitate to show you what-for like she's 8 feet tall lol. 

My blood family has never treated me half as well as these ladies do and I am just so blessed to know them and have them in my life! 

So here's to a sneaky surprise!  *shush* no telling!🤫

Edit: She loved it and no one spilled the beans! We got to have a lovely little tea time with some wonderful conversation and some very delicious tea, yummy pastries and little finger sandwiches! She's actually thinking about using the location for her bridal shower 😊"
happy,"There was this local Mexican joint housed inside a run-down, little-used gas station. Classic ""hole in the wall"" type setup, which should have been this community's first clue that the food would be stupendous. They had these chorizo burritos with spicy sauce that just spoke to me on some metaphysical level.

Unfortunately, last summer they announced they were shutting down. They just weren't making enough money. I was despondent -- nothing else in this two-horse town even came close to approximating the culinary excellence this place provided.

They reopened yesterday. I was finally able to get in there today, and I swear to you that the clouds parted and angels sang as I took my first bite. It's every bit as good as I remembered.

I'm recommending them to everybody I know and hoping they manage to hold on this time."
happy,"A few days ago my co worker complimented me on my hair. She said that it's in perfect condition and that she loves it.
Yesterday I met up with my dearest friends, and my friend's girlfriend told me how she was chatting with her friend some time ago, and they both agreed on how I looked like I came straight out of a movie last time we met.
Ngl, lately I didn't feel good about my appearance, so this really lifted my spirit. I thought I was going to melt both of these times lol.
"
happy,"some of them don’t even know about that and to some of them we can don’t text for some time

it’s not bcu we ghost them, we forget ppl’s names and it’s hard to text some of them bcu we just forget names, we basically need to write it EVERYWHERE

but, we want to say, that they all beautiful, we appreciate every one of them. we wish good luck to our enemies and if we will meet again, we will be ready for this 

we love every person we meet in our life, doesn’t matter if this person good or bad

but we pleased for our friends, they so much beautiful and we pleased for some enemies, bcu of them we grow up

we miss and love some persons who don’t loves us back but it’s okay

thank you for being alive, friends, thankful that you all exists 
"
happy,"In my 30’s, yesterday on my second attempt, I passed my driving test. It still feels like a fever dream and still can’t believe it actually happened but I did it. 

I never thought I would get behind the wheel of a car. Fear and anxiety being a factor but something has always gotten in the way any time I thought about it over the years.

I am so proud of myself for doing something entirely outside of my comfort zone and gaining new independence. 

Happy is an understatement."
happy,"I had a girl I’ve been dating over for dinner and drinks last night to celebrate NYE.  Things started getting physical so I suggested going to the bedroom.  It was a hard no.

I was a little bit puzzled (we’ve had sex before).  She then informs me she has her period, appears visibly upset and apologizes.  I sort of start laughing; now she looks puzzled.

I tell her I’m chuckling at the apology; there is absolutely no reason to be sorry and I couldn’t be happier just giving her a kiss at midnight and waking up beside her tomorrow (she’s never spent the night).  I offer her a heating pad, pillows and to run out to grab some midol; whatever she needs to be comfortable, she need only let me know.

The result was a lovely young lady, stunned by the thoughtfulness and filled with appreciation.  Though I invited a ‘date’ over for dinner, we decided to become exclusive and I woke up beside my new ‘girlfriend’ the next morning.

What a great start to 2022.

Edit: inclusion of exclusivity."
happy,"And I just...

It feels so good.

Another friend, let's call her M, became super super super close with me over the past 2 months.

Anyway, tonight, my oldest friend (I've known her for like 26 years; she was my first girlfriend at like 13 years old), let's call her A, said she was really jealous about M and I was like why? And she told me she was super possessive of me.

I've always had a thing for A (except while I was in relationships) and I... guess all the signs were there. I mean... the last time we hung out she was grinding her butt all over my leg for like 20 minutes straight while I was chatting with friends at a house party. She also always makes sure to tell me she loves me before we get off the phone and she's not even remotely an affectionate woman.

I cant believe how oblivious I was.. Autism i guess haha

3 months ago I thought I was going to be alone forever. And now this on top of everything else.

Fuck 😊

I'm so happy."
happy,"My dad bought me a razer deathadder, and i already am seeing improvement."
happy,"I was asked by one of my friends if I wanted to go to her church and I said yes because I don’t usually get to hang out with her outside of school. When I got there it was loud but the music was good, after a while we then got food that was absolutely delicious 😋, It was Spaghetti, garlic bread, and fried chicken, plus a salad and a cup of apple juice :D, I ate and had fun talking to my friend and when we left we got Starbucks, me and my friend listened to music for the rest of the car ride to my home. I’m now home and I just really wanted to share what happened today, Sadly this was the first year I didn’t celebrate Easter with a Easter egg hunt but I still had just as much of a good time as the other past years :)

Be Happy guys 😁🙌❤️"
happy,"Didn't know who to tell this to, so why not literally everyone on the internet?

A year ago I was at my lowest, ready to end it all. No license at 23, stuck in an abusive home, no car, no job, no friends, no plans forward. Almost exactly a year later I have my license, l've bought a car, I'm buying a house with my best friend and now boyfriend (who I've been in love with for months), I have an amazing job lined up, moving out of my state to somewhere heee much better for me and safer. I finally feel like I'm a person!! I’m the happiest I’ve ever been!"
happy,"I remember getting a notif, looking at my phone, then freaking my family out cuz I just suddenly started jumping up and down yelling 12 DOLLARS! 12 DOLLARS! 😂

I really came a long way with working on music, putting my heart into beats just to make people dance and forget about whatever troubles them, so seeing people begin to support me made me feel happy beyond words.

Finally I can consider myself an actual artist, not just a hobbyist making music for fun, but an actual artist that was capable of inspiring others.

I never thought I'd make it to this point, I know it's a very small win, but its the first step towards many other milestones yet to come.

I have many people to thank, the yt community and soundcloud, but I think Id be years behind if it werent for niche communities on reddit supporting me all the way through.

Its only January and it's already a big year for me ❤️"
happy,"Got my dog a toy today at a local ranch supply store. This was supposed to be the be all end all toy for destructive dogs. She managed to tear chunks out of it in 5 minutes flat. I wrote the company and said nice try, but it just didn't hold up. Company wrote back and said that only about 5% of dogs globally could defeat their rubber toys. As my puppy was one of those 5%, would I allow her to become a tester for their company? Heck yes, I'll let her do that. Whether they pay me, or whether they just send free toys, it's still a win for me and my American Bully XL.

ETA, this was an off brand toy, not the well known super duty one."
happy," I got both a new laptop, and a PS5! I came into some money recently so I decided to treat myself. I needed a new laptop for school I just started at a university, and a PS5 so I can play the new Spiderman game! I have wanted a PS5 for nearly 3 years now, and it is finally mine. I also bought my textbooks for school as well. I still have a lot of money, but I will not go overboard. I will spend only what I need. I can buy lunch this week at school, and fix my bike but thats it. I need to open a savings account online and I will just put a bunch of it in there. "
happy,"I've been pretty depressed for several month and I just started to get better. I've develloped a crush on a old schoolmate that is really beautiful and out of my league, but I'm not pessimistic of my chances.

happy,"First pic and second pic is after
Third and fourth pic is before"
happy,"I got the Sony WH-1000XM4’s and they’re so amazing. The sound quality is so nice and I can’t get over the noise cancellation feature. Everything is so quiet and I feel so much calmer. Noises put me on edge sometimes when I’m overwhelmed (often), so they have just helped a lot. :D"
happy,"This is so weird , but a few days ago my boyfriend and I went into a little no-contact stage after a small argument we had over something petty . 

It wasn’t specific or anything but we both just stopped reaching out and got busy . 


Well yesterday after like 2 days of no contact , I go to message him on instagram and the second my message delivered, I received a message from him on text message 😂 

We literally messaged each other at the exact same moment after 2 days and were thinking of each other exactly at the same moment 

So adorable haha "
happy,"I'm celebrating today!
I found out a lot about myself during this year because of reddit and people here.

thank you all, folks!"
happy,"Each design is 100% hand-drawn by me using a digital tablet, a real artist that actually draws.

No gimmicks no Ai or any automated special effects – just skilled artistry that will capture every detail."
happy,"Where I live, there’s practically nothing on this road, other than apartment complexes, a school, a few house (all neighbors in the houses get along really well-) and a little corner store ran by an older Asian woman.

I am the type of girl who wears that ‘emo aesthetic’ as my mom calls it, but really I wear skater/street wear and it drives her insane. Today I am meant to go to a meeting and dress nice, so I put on a cute little dress and a cardigan matched with black heels my sister let me borrow.

My mom asked me to go get some coffee from the store, and I accepted happily so I can see the Asian lady since I actually enjoy the small talk we have when I’m checking out. When walking there however, my heel had broken outside her store, and I went in any ways with a hop, and went to get the coffee, but she had stopped me.

She took a look at what happend, and the grabbed green string and told to kneel down, and I did. She started wrapping the heel in string, and fixed it temporarily. I thanked her Atleast 20 times before I had checked out and joked about it with her for a bit.

She really made my day so much better and I can’t thank her enough, even if the trying didn’t hold all the way there and back, it still was a nice feeling and made me really happy."
happy,"I work by myself in animal rescue in a place where abandoned animals is pretty common. After my money goes into them and my own groceries, I often have next to nothing to spend on myself. For the last year and a half, I was sleeping on an old donated sofa bed in the main room. But my birthday was last month, and some friends chipped in to buy me the mattress, bed frame, and even new pillows and bedsheets! I did end up building it myself, which took the whole month because I had to find time between running around doing animal stuff, so it feels like my accomplishment too. I just feel so proud of myself and so happy and lucky to have great friends.
"
happy,We’ve been dating for a year and about five months? They picked me up from my apartment and we went to a really nice restaurant. I was panicking so much.
happy,This is my cat Hopper. He’s a pretty rad and chill cat and really just likes to hang out with his people. The lil dude doesn’t know it but he makes me very happy and life would be boring without him. 
happy,So I wanted to share that something rly good happened to me in my career/job today and I usually share these things with my gf of 5 years but we recently broke up and I have no one to share the happiness im feeling right now so I thought I'd just post it here :) 
happy,"Over 2 years ago, a friend of ours passed away leaving 3 kids orphaned and a half sibling without a support system. My wife and I took in all 4 kids, as we were quite close with the kids. We got legal guardianship of the 2 youngest about 6 months after they moved in. The youngest is now 10. She started calling my wife ""Mommy"" about a year ago. This took some getting used to as all of our other kids call her ""Mom"". 

I however, remained Mr. MyFirstName. She has never had a dad before, and she had always called me that before she moved in. She gives me hugs everyday (now) and tells me she loves me frequently (yes, I know this won't last). So I was not worried about what she calls me. We went on a trip with my brother and his family, and sometime during the week, she just started calling me ""Daddy"". I'm not sure if it was because her cousin (my niece - 6F) calls my brother Daddy (a lot) or what caused it. At one point, we were at a theme park, and she was calling me Daddy over and over again, and I completely missed it, because I wasn't used to it and her voice is similar to my niece. My SIL grabs my arm and says ""Daddy!!!  Someone is calling you"". I felt awful, and so overjoyed at the same time. We've been home several days and I'm still Daddy (and getting used to it), but also Mr. MyFirstName sometimes too, but it still makes me smile.

  
We are hoping the adoption will be finalized this year. "
happy,"I came out to my parents about being non binary (AFAB) when I was 16, I've known it since I was 15 and rn I'm 20. So it's been a long time and I'm quite sure of myself about who I am and how I feel.
A few years ago my mom kept telling me that it was a phase and my dad even told me that I was just following a trend that that if I ever did anything to make my body appear less feminine then he wonnt consider me his child anymore... Other than that everything was great in my life.

But now my parents are suddenly trying to accept me!
I have no idea what changed but today my mom came to my room to give me some of my dad's old clothes, we're going to attend a wedding soon so I needed good clothes for that, and she gave me my dad's old suit!
I was so happy that for the first time she didn't ask me to wear a dress, and my dad accepted to lend me his old clothes for a formal event without trying to convince me to wear something else first😁😁😁
And when I tried everything on my mom looked at me and I could see all the love in her eyes and she just said ''you're becoming a beautiful person''
I almost cried, I'm french so we have a very binary language and she used the word joli/jolie which means beautiful but it sounds the same way no matter if it's masculine or feminine (unlike beau/belle), and she said person and not young woman as she usually did

I'M SO HAPPY 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
They're both 50+ and they're actually trying to change how they acted and how they were raised (like considering anything LGBT+ just a young people trend) to accept me as me 🥰 I love them so much and I just want to share that joy with everyone and anyone right now 🥳❤️"
happy,"Recently, I went to the movie theater with my kid, and while we were waiting for the movie to start, we played duck-catching. We were both thrilled to catch two of them, and I was delighted to capture this moment. I sincerely felt that happiness can be found in the simplest of things and tastes even better when the joy is shared with a loved one."
happy,"Ill try to be short and sweet, but basically I mentioned to my boyfriend, close friend of two years boyfriend for almost one year, that I'd really love a prom-posal for our senior year since I've never experienced one and it's a once in a lifetime kinda thing for us.

It was a while ago and I assumed her forgot because his schedule with school, sports, gym, etc has him running around. I wasn't even upset and chose to keep it to myself since I know his life is already hectic and didn't want to feel like I was pressuring him.

Well today we were in my room relaxing, I bought some small Lego sets to do, before we started building them he told me if I wanted to see a card trick he just learned.

He dabbles in card tricks and magic, when we first met he did a lot of magic for me, I love watching these tricks to this day. He sat me down next to him and started going on about Royal flush being the best hand in poker while doing the trick for me. I was confused but going along with it and before I knew it he said ""You know what else would be the best, you going to prom with me"" and in front of me the royal flush hand with heart cards with will you go to prom with me on the cards.

I'm heavily emotional and started bawling my eyes like a baby cause he caught me off guard and I didn't know what to say but he reminded me I had to say Yes while hugging me lol.

Regardless, I'm still tearing up over it still cause I can't believe how great of a guy he is and I adore every nerdy, geeky ounce of him.

I just wanted to share this because even though I know it's probably some silly high school romance I still feel like the luckiest person in the world.

Hope you're all having a good day or night and I wish the best for all of you who took time to read this sappy stuff :)"
happy,"Hi, Everyone.

I was going to wait a week, but I had to create an account and post this because I’m just too happy to keep it inside anymore.

A few days ago, my wife posted on this board. She was having a tough time sleeping, and in the middle of this rough night, the thought of something I did brought a smile to her face. She shared that moment with everyone here, and in response, the amount of goodwill and kindness that flowed from this community was overwhelming. 

She kept this post secret from me—never expecting it to make other than a few people smile. Little did she know, it would gain a ton of traction. The generosity and support that followed made it tough for her to conceal, and eventually, she showed me the thought that made her so happy this past Monday at 3 A.M..

My wife is amazing. I’m so happy, lucky, and fortunate to be in that group of people who have truly found their soulmate. My heart becomes full just thinking about her, and sometimes I just say her name randomly because it makes me happy to hear. I love her so much, and I can’t stop smiling right now.

I also want to take a moment to thank everyone in this community. What you all did truly shows the amazing types of people you are. From the messages of encouragement, to the acts of support, it’s a been such a joy. I’ll never forget any of it, and when I called my mother to tell her about what everyone here did, it seriously made her day.

Thank you all so much. You made my wife happy. You made my mom happy. For that, I will forever be grateful, and I promise to do my best to spread all the positive energy you gave us back out into the world.

This truly is the bright center of the Internet."
happy,"...Say Yes to the Dress! I've watched it before and it's always been a blast, but in the last two days I've been watching SYTTD Australia and Atlanta, and it's exactly what I need right now. So many happy and funny moments and it's just warm feeling to watch people embark on new incredible journeys, even when so much else feels like it's ending.

I love sharing joys and wins with people, and being able to do that with people I'll never meet is really filling a hole in my soul right now."
happy,"I have a fear of needles, but I wanted to donate blood to save someone's life. A few days ago I finally managed to do so 😁"
happy,"2 years ago, when I told my family and friends I wanted to release all original music as a fully independent artist, and try to turn it into a full time living, almost everyone I knew didn’t believe I’d get very far… I know realistically the vast majority of people that try don’t get far, so I could understand where they were coming from (the music industry is insanely hard to make a living in). But I would never know if I didn’t try…So I did. And I worked so hard, and so many times I asked myself why I was doing this…So many times I wanted to give up. But looking at this milestone, I feel very happy and proud that I didn’t give up. I’m also earning a decent part time income from my music too! The next goal is full time! Just thought I’d share this, and to not give up on your dreams if you truly love doing them! :)

happy,This is my girlfriend of 7 years and both of our kids 5 year old girl and 3 year old boy. We both worked a long day but wanted to treat our kids to some fun at the park before the sun went down and go to Dairy Queen to end the night! We have been through some hard times but no matter what the light always will shine the next day and I have to keep my light shining!!!
happy,"* I've been consistently going to the gym for a year and three months, and I'm muscular now.

happy,"I really love him. I spent forever putting his gift together and when I finally gave it to him seeing him cry made me so happy. He said he’s never been loved like this before and that he loves me more than anything. 

I’m just so so happy I get to make him feel loved cause he makes me feel so safe and loved too. I’m not so great with my words like he is but I think this really showed him how I feel :)"
happy,"I've struggled in the dating arena for years, only managing to get one or two first dates, from the apps. Last year, I realized I was asexual, and tried a dating site for asexuals. I started chatting with someone on there, and just met in person, and we really hit it off. "

happy,"I'm a few states away from home for a conference this week, and during some downtime I looked up things to do nearby. Turns out the art museum a short walk away had my FAVORITE sculpture on display, I didn't even know it had been put into a collection! 

L' Amante by Beth Cavener is every bit as beautiful in real life as I could have imagined and I am SO excited to have been able to marvel at it with my own two eyes!"
happy," I've been the happiest I've been for at least the past five years. No real complaints, no real worries. I mean, little day to day things like in a sitcom, but nothing crazy. I get up not worried about hating my job, don't think I have any real enemies, have a wonderful family and have the means to take care of them. Not religious either, so this is not fueled by my love for a higher being.

I found what makes me happy and don't really need anything else. Delighted to share my positive vibes if anyone needs some."
happy,It's Spring! I am so happy when I hear the birds and frogs on my walk to work.
happy,Started the year making better changes. Ive lost 19lbs in total since January.
happy,"It's been impossible for me (66F) to find anybody locally who knows enough about this to treat me, and the Mayo Clinic turned me down as a patient because I don't have the worse, more dangerous level of the disease, just the basic really shitty form of it.

I recently found out about Ketamine being used to treat chronic pain✅ trauma✅ depression✅ anxiety✅ *and this mast cell disease*✅, and five days ago I started on a daily microdose protocol. (The Ketamine works on the trauma *and* makes mast cells **calm TF down**, which helps the depression, anxiety, and pain, which will help calm down my nervous system, which will improve the mast cell symptoms, which include all of the above except the trauma.)

I didn't know what to expect because the disease makes my body think I'm allergic to virtually everything, but I haven't reacted noticeably to the drug at all. I haven't been optimistic at all about my future since my diagnosis, I'm so excited!"
happy,Fitting for a family of hobbits.
happy,We finally found some second hand ones given away for free! And they're so nice looking too!
happy,"I (25m) am in a relationship for the first time in my adult life and can not describe how happy I am.

Towards the end of October last year my boss told me that one of my co-workers (23f) who I did also consider a friend had told her she had a crush on me. I admitted that while I had never really considered it before, if she was interested I was willing to give it a go. We started flirting and a couple weeks later we had our first date. 

The funny part is that at the beginning of January my now girlfriend and I were talking and it came out that while we were definitely friends rather than just co-workers at the time, neither of us had considered a romantic relationship until our boss told us both that the other was interested and we realized that our boss had just been bored and decided to play matchmaker. We have since confronted our boss and thanked her for doing what she did.

We are both incredibly happy with our situation now and incredibly grateful to our bored meddling boss for setting us up (and creating two incredibly inefficient employees)."

happy,"Hi Reddit! I’ve been trying to use my account as an outlet to manage my feelings and healing. I am so excited to share that I was finally able to mow my lawn, rake my leaves, and plant a few seeds in my yard today! Some backstory (trigger warning: SA), I was sexually assaulted by a man that lived on my street, and for the longest time, I was nervous to work on my yard in my front lawn because I did not want to see him. But, he finally moved out. I was so excited to see the moving truck near his house. I don’t have to hire a lawn crew anymore and I don’t have to take the long route walking to try and avoid this person. I am very excited and happy. I haven’t done my own yard work for a long time and I feel very good. 🥰"
happy,"I just wanted to share to everyone that I am truly happy. The past couple of weeks, I have spent my afternoons and nights outside on my back porch just enjoying life. Sometimes I will watch my phone, or I’ll browse Reddit, but just being outside in the bliss, cool, and calming air just makes me feel some kind of way. Pair that with the beautiful sounds of the birds, and the frogs in the distance. It all just puts me at ease. Most of my life has been pretty stressful, especially now that I’m graduating high school in less than a month. To be able to enjoy the creations of God with the moon shining, the chirps of the birds in the trees, the speckled sky littered with stars, and the gentle sway of the pine trees… I’ve rambled. Point is guys, I truly feel happy. I have nothing to complain about. I have great friends, great parents, a cute little chihuahua, supporting teachers and staff at my school, and most importantly what seems to be a great future. No idea what I’ve done to deserve it all but I’m grateful. Just wanted to share my emotions because seeing life at face value, excluding all negatives, is so special to me. "
happy,"A few weeks ago I won sole custody of my 3 kids from an abusive drug addicted ex. Today she signed the final modification of custody with a notary and everything. Looking forward to moving on and giving my kids the loving home they deserve. It’s taken 3 years, tons of heartbreak and emotions, multiple court appearances and tens of thousands of dollars to get to this point. It’s worth it and you can’t give up! "
happy,"See the before and after, but this fireplace hadn't been touched in years and was not being used

I ripped out the old tile, poured a new base, pressure washed the fireplace, painted the cast iron, used lemon juice to clean the barss exterior, and retiled the entire thing

happy,"My sister has just passed her Business Tax exam after having struggled with it before. I am so incredibly proud of her. She's already a good Accountant but that piece of paper is unfortunately what you need to show it. I knew she'd get there in the end and she has achieved success today. She is going to go so far in her career and I couldn't be happier. Well done you superstar!

happy,"What's so special about an office snack drawer?

It sounds funny but I have dreamed of having my own snack drawer at my own desk in my own office for as long as I can remember.  While I may not have my own office, I have a nice cubicle next to a large set of windows in the corner of the building.  It's wonderful!

I spent the better part of a decade getting an undergraduate engineering degree and graduated at 33 while working to support myself and doing extracurricular projects.  There were so many times I just wanted to quit.  I moved around a lot and changed majors at one point so it took a while to get through it all but I did it.  I now work for a company that I've always wanted to work for and I have myself a snack drawer.

It's silly but this snack drawer reminds me of all the blood, sweat, and tears that went into getting my degree and I just feel so accomplished when I turn around, open it, and grab some crackers.  I've come so far since I was waiting tables with no direction in life and it's a nice reminder that all the hard work paid off.  I can't help but smile when I think about it.  Lmao, sounds so weird typing it out but it makes me so happy!"

Just wanted to put it out there and be grateful for the opportunities that have come my way in the last couple of months.

 Who would have thought that there were so many opportunities, experiences, and pretty faces out there.

happy,"A few days ago my co worker complimented me on my hair. She said that it's in perfect condition and that she loves it.
Yesterday I met up with my dearest friends, and my friend's girlfriend told me how she was chatting with her friend some time ago, and they both agreed on how I looked like I came straight out of a movie last time we met.
Ngl, lately I didn't feel good about my appearance, so this really lifted my spirit. I thought I was going to melt both of these times lol.

happy,Been slightly over 2 and a half years sober but my third birthday sober...working towards my third year this August and this pupper means the world to me. Hes my little buddy and I owe him so much.
happy,"I'm solo traveling at the moment and I've had the realisation that I'm a completely different person than I was when I was younger (I'm 32 now). I remember back then I was so insecure and I dealt with crippling anxiety. I was so self aware and ashamed of myself that I had to mentally prepare myself to do grocery shopping because I was so afraid that people would judge me. I've never been conventionally attractive, but back then I was convinced I I was absolutely hideous and I didn't deserve good things. I feel so sorry for my younger self. Now I don't give a crap about what people think of me, I've accepted myself for who I am and find beauty in small things. Sometimes I still struggle with my appearance, but not in the self destructive way as I did ten years ago.I try to always be kind to myself and treat myself how I treat good friends. At the moment I'm doing whatever I want whenever I want, all the choices I make, I make for me. It is so freeing. I feel so much love for myself, ny life, my friends and family, my work.
God I love solo traveling."
happy,"A close encounter of the saintly kind…

…At the grocery store with my daughter. She’s little, so tends to have the “Please, buy me everything!” anytime we’re in the store. Most of the time she’s fine with a “Not today, sweetie.” but today, she was in her feels because ALLLLLLLL of the day-after Valentine’s Day items were smack dab in front of the door when we walked in. She wanted a balloon. Mommy said “Not today, sweetie.” and today, that “not today” didn’t go over very well. She proceeded to be very pouty. Meh, it happens. 

Well, we’re in an aisle looking for artichoke hearts and there stood a kindly, bespectacled, affable looking gentleman. I asked his pardon as we passed. We started making small talk after he tried to engage my daughter and she made it very clear that she wanted a balloon and wasn’t allowed to have one. He laughed and looked at me chuckling. “It doesn’t get easier as they get older!” to which I replied “She’s six… pray for me!” 

The kindly gentleman (before we learned his name) knelt down and said to my daughter “You know… balloons are wonderful, but they are often the best when they’re surprises, so maybe you can look forward to getting one when you least expect it.” This seemed to go over well with my daughter. 

The kindly gentleman (Mr. Myles, I came to know) and I continued chatting about kids, life, and random musings, eventually parting with a genuine sense of happiness over the entire interaction. He proceeded to the front of the store and my daughter and I continued our shopping. 

A few moments later, he found us at the back of the store with a heart shaped balloon. With the biggest smile ever, he handed it to my daughter and said “See? Isn’t it so much better when it’s a surprise?” I was dumbfounded, more tickled pink than I’d been in a while and said “You’re an absolute angel! No wait- a Saint! Thank you Saint Myles!” 

Random acts of kindness are the best. In a world full of curmudgeonly behavior- be like Myles."
happy,"Okay, I have that sweet sweet christmas money left and have two things I could spend it on, bread making supplies or a guitar. Id use the guitar more, but I don't have enough and will still have to save. I *may* get a guitar for my birthday. I already got something though so maybe I should wait for the b-day money for the guitar. I pick up on string instruments quickly. I really love music and writing songs and having an acoustic is key. I only have an electric and I cannot play my dads guitar because i just don't *feel* it. If you're an instrument player, you may know the feeling of playing an instrument you just don't feel in tune with. I love making music, but baking makes me super happy too. Id like to make bread and sell it and Im pretty good if i do say so myself. Maybe this money can help me buy the guitar? I may have already made my decision by the time people reply because I'm impatient, but I'd like to see your ideas."
happy,"I wrote this not long after my rock bottom in my personal life & health wise. Although I’m not snowboarding or sewing I have other creative outlets. I have a family of my own, a great career & all my friends & family are happy & healthy"
happy,"I start my first job tomorrow!

I’m a new grad nurse currently in the Philippines, and after passing the board exam, I contacted my review center and expressed my interest in lecturing to help teach others how to pass their licensure exam.

I’m starting tomorrow and it feels like a dream came true that I didn’t even know I had. I love helping people, it’s part of why I got into nursing in the first place, and the knowledge that I can have even a small part in helping others getting to that point makes me truly happy.

The company is very easy to communicate with, I respect the hell out of my seniors, I’ll travel around the country to lecture at the other centers, and I’ll be able to use this opportunity to also help prepare myself for eventually taking the US NCLEX as well.

This year hasn’t started out great, but this is a giant W to get my mood up, and I am so greatful for the opportunity and experience."
happy,"So happy right now. 

I made some new friends through work. The three of us clicked immediately on the first day. 

Tonight, we went to dinner at my favorite restaurant (Korean BBQ). We ate so much great food and drank so much delicious soju lol

I dont remember the last time I laughed so hard. My cheeks were flushed and I smiled the entire drive home. 

Feeling so grateful for the good people in my life 🥰☺️"
happy,"It's been a long time coming. I haven't been able get more than a buzz for about four years now on account of how high my tolerance is. My lungs have begun to protest as well. I've had it in my mind for a while now that I need to take a lengthy tolerance break. Whenever my weed is about to run out I tell myself that this is it and that once it's gone I would begin a several month long break.

What always happens is I will smoke my last bowl and then find myself walking over to the dispensary that's literally a two minute walk away and buying another ounce. Last night I finished smoking my supply and I didn't buy more. I didn't buy any today either. The dispensary closes in 13 minutes and that will make it official.

For the first time in probably five years, I chose not to smoke weed. Tiny milestone, but tomorrow I will abstain again, and the next day, and the next, and the next."
happy,Just wanted to share. 
happy,"This morning I was going to work and it was dark but I saw my bf pass me on the highway on our way to work, I instantly got butterflies. Then when I got to the Dunkin drive thru who do I see in front of me….. it’s him. Lol I didn’t think he would notice but then when I got to the window to pay for my coffee the cashier said “here you go. The gentleman in front of you already paid” it’s the little things. y’all I’m so in love 🥰 "
happy,Those birds that everyone used to hear in the morning are coming back. They all migrated about six years ago with no explanation and now they are back
happy,I (F18) talked to the army three months ago about joining just for the fun of it. I had no idea that I could get trained as an LPN. (I want to be a doctor one day so this will get me started in building my career) I signed my contract at MEPs yesterday. I'm really excited to be able to go to college and be able to move out of my parent's house!! 
happy,"First there's A, she's been my number one bestie since we were 7! Me and her get together to watch bullshit reality TV and talk major shit about the men. She loves videogames and she 100% completed breath of the wild and working her way through the new one. She loves her younger brother and takes him on as many vacations as she can. She puts together the most perfect for you, beautiful thoughtful gifts which she presents for you artfully. She has a talent at art and also interior design and her place is stylishly decorated and immaculately clean. Her passion lies in the Library though and she's almost finished with her masters in library science while working full time as a receptionist but soon she'll be a librarian. She's also super fucking funny. When we get together it's allllways laughing.

Then there's B, she's only like a genius scientist and professor with a perfect SAT score who just landed a job at NASA working from home. ALSO she runs marathons even though she got long COVID and has heart problems now. Her goal is still to run in every state and she's still working her way through it. She also skiis, roller skates, rock climbs, and has completed iron man triathlons. On top of that she can also draw and recently she made her own stickers of famous rock formations (shes a geologist). She's the most emotionally intelligent human I know and crafts everything she says with the most delicate tactful gentle thoughtfulness without sugarcoating anything and tells you things to challenge your ideas and potentially harmful or toxic thought processes. She is also a good baker and sends me cookies in the mail a lot!

Then there's C, he's probably the most interesting dude I know although it took him two years of talking to me every day to actually open up about the history of his life. He's been to jail a few times for various things and he told me all about the people there and most of them were ok guys who just ran amock and got themselves in trouble (except for theives who were all around no good people) he's been a chef in fancy restaurants but he is keen on languages and very knowledgeable about them particularly those from the middle east. He originally wanted to be an academic until life took a turn. When he was younger he did martial arts, tended to carnivorous plants, was part of the orchid society, and went out into the wilderness to hunt rocks a lot. He got into bad accidents and was badly injured so now he can't really do the stuff he used to love. It makes me sad. But he's super funny in the most imaginative quirky way. And no one has ever made me laugh in quite the same way.

Then there's well, the other C. He's a young thing. He's a bright person with a promising future. He's in medical school studying to be a surgeon and he's recently gotten his masters degree in the top of his class. He loves videogames and he's quiet, reserved, values manners but he's not afraid of dancing. He loves a good party and night out. When I went to the uk and visited him, he showed me some of the castles in Wales of which he is very proud. He has a strong sense of patriotism about being Welsh. He is the most different from me of all of my friends from two totally different upbringings and worlds but somehow we never run out of things to talk about. When I get in my dramatic moods, He has a way of saying just the perfect matter of fact thing to drop me down to earth and I laugh as I fall. He is a complete nerd to the core but he has a little bit of a charming cockiness and confidence that makes me love the hell out of him.

I have a bunch more friends but if I told you about them all then this would be insanely long! So I just talk about the closest ones. "
happy,"There was this local Mexican joint housed inside a run-down, little-used gas station. Classic ""hole in the wall"" type setup, which should have been this community's first clue that the food would be stupendous. They had these chorizo burritos with spicy sauce that just spoke to me on some metaphysical level.

Unfortunately, last summer they announced they were shutting down. They just weren't making enough money. I was despondent -- nothing else in this two-horse town even came close to approximating the culinary excellence this place provided.

They reopened yesterday. I was finally able to get in there today, and I swear to you that the clouds parted and angels sang as I took my first bite. It's every bit as good as I remembered.

I'm recommending them to everybody I know and hoping they manage to hold on this time."
happy,She's old enough to follow along and we played a cupcake gathering boardgame. I grew up playing lots of games and I'm just so psyched about more! We followed about 90% of the rules and we had a blast!

happy,"recently, life has been busy so i've started to put my phone aside other than for an hour, and honestly it has made all the difference. there are so many unnecessary things we think about when scrolling endlessly on social media , highly recommend putting your phone in another room, so that you feel a weight lifted off your shoulders!"
happy,"Hello and Happy New Year folks! My first post here, hope everyone is doing well and it's time to start being happy 😊"
happy,"If a genie or another supernatural being approached me when I was 10 years old and asked me for three wishes, I would definitely ask for the following: 

* to find true love (I was a very romantic kid, haha)
*  to become a teacher
*  and to make video games. 

It took a long time, but finally, at the age of 30, I met the most wonderful woman ever, and she miraculously fell in love with me too. That happened in 2016. 

For various reasons, I had started and quit my studies multiple times. However, in 2020, I was finally able to teach my first class in high school! Yes, it was the year of the pandemic, and it was challenging, but I loved it and it has become my profession. 

In January of this year (2023), I decided that it was time to seriously pursue making video games. In November, I released my first game! It was an amazing experience, to the point that game development has become my number one hobby. 

I don't know what the future holds, what 2024 will bring for me or for anyone reading this, but I hope we all continue to pursue our wishes, and maybe even reach them. Happy new year!"
happy,"So, this was my first year applying to physical therapy school and I managed to get accepted everywhere I applied. I even have a soft offer for a paid research assistant position for work similar to what I did in undergrad!

I understand that PT school isn't the best financial decision for most people, but I did accept my offer at a relatively cheap school. Beyond that, I grew up with a single mom and my first paycheck will be more than she has ever made! It just feels like all the work is paying off and I am making progress towards my goals."
happy,One of my closest friends went to NYC in an au pair exchange and I painted one of my favorite photos of us  with watercolor and then I gave it to her at the airport before she got on the plane! 💗 She loved btw and it's now on her bedside table in her bedroom at her host family house. 
happy,"I (25m) have been going out with a coworker of mine (23f) for about a month now after flirting for a few weeks before that. I've been pretty gushy the whole time, but she has some baggage from a past relationship ship that's made it hard for her to fully commit to relationship. 

Well last week, one of our other coworkers told me that she actually refered to me as her boyfriend for the first time while complaining that our manager didn't give us more shifts together, and a couple days ago she called me for the first time instead of the texting we've been doing to tell me she loves me. 

This is my first relationship since a meaningless highschool situationship, and I am just over the moon and need to get this off my chest"

happy,"Howdy! 

I'm so appreciative of all of y'all's support! I was worried if I was overstaying my welcome on this sub, but y'all were so supportive! For anyone starting their fitness journey from my posts, or anyone who is in their own fitness journey, I'm so proud of you! I'd like to address a couple thing so constantly see in the replies. I'd rather address it on the post instead of individual comments. 

I do infact know I need a calorie deficit to lost consistent weight, and I've been on a calorie deficit since day 2

No, this is not a karma farm. Anyone who values karma so much they lie and take advantage of peoples kindness is an idiot. If you still believe this is a karma farm, that's fine but please don't be rude to or others who just want to improve their lives.

Yes, I know I'm fat, I know I'm unhealthy, you don't need to constantly spam in in the replies. Please come up with more insults because I'm running out of jokes. 

Sorry for the long post but I hope y'all have a great day, Cheers!"
happy,"So, my brother and I were walking to the store just to pick up some stuff. We got in and I went to the drinks section, to get a flavoured water. Some kid who looked a little older than us was half-way blocking the drink I needed to get (I don't care, I'm really patient), and when he noticed, immediately apologized and moved. I felt bad, I said ""no, it's alright!"", and he mumbled something inaudible to me afterwards, but smiled, so did I. 

My brother and I got our items, and were waiting in line. It was just the guy from the drinks section in front of us. He payed for his stuff, then handed a 10 dollar bill to the worker, and said, ""That's to pay for them"", pointing to us, whilst exiting the store. We thanked him, and he said ""You guys are nice"", and he was out of the store. It all happened really fast, but it paid for our stuff. We left and his dad or someone was already driving away. He waved, and we did too. It was just really sweet I thought. I hadn't had that happened to me before."
happy,"My son loves to play outside. The house next to us is being rebuilt so it is unoccupied at the moment. There is a small pond located on the property so every now and then we venture over there to see what sort of wildlife we can spot. Yesterday, disappointment struck when we arrived to the pond and didn’t spot any animals. Normally there’s at least a few ducks, but not today. After about 10 minutes he looked down at the ground, picked up a very high-quality stick, and threw it into the water. The stick struck the water. The splash made him so happy he exclaimed, “I did it dada, I did it.” It took me a second but then I realized, wow he is so happy because of the stick hitting the water! Mind you, I have never thrown anything into this pond before, so this was just his primal instinct telling him “pick up stick, throw stick water, stick make splash, make boy happy”… anyways I thought I’d share this because it was enough to make a grown-man cry. Such simple acts can bring so much joy. We’re such simple creatures haha. Have a great day everyone

happy,"Now i don't live on this subreddit, however ima write a thing that kinda makes me smile right now

In my school we got a class called ""musical"", volentarily, where basically everyone that is in his last 2 grades helps performing a musical (11th grade \[second to last\] helps, 12th (last) on stage). My teacher is doing this job for 20 years already, so he knows what he has to do, and what will happen. HOWEVER we are his first premiere, the first one to perform the musical ""School Of Rock"" in our country (Germany).

We've began to practice a few weeks ago, we knew our singing parts more or less already, so it wasn't such a big deal. Now that we are on our final days it starts to hit us, that we will be standing for so many people, singing, shouting and dancing. And boy/girl you don't know how happy i am. It might be that i am going crazy again, but boyyy/guuuurlll i can't stop smiling, it's gonna be nexxt weeeeeeek :D

It's all fun, of course sometimes we don't agree with everything, but mostly we (I) have fun"
happy,"So, my brother and I were walking to the store just to pick up some stuff. We got in and I went to the drinks section, to get a flavoured water. Some kid who looked a little older than us was half-way blocking the drink I needed to get (I don't care, I'm really patient), and when he noticed, immediately apologized and moved. I felt bad, I said ""no, it's alright!"", and he mumbled something inaudible to me afterwards, but smiled, so did I. 

My brother and I got our items, and were waiting in line. It was just the guy from the drinks section in front of us. He payed for his stuff, then handed a 10 dollar bill to the worker, and said, ""That's to pay for them"", pointing to us, whilst exiting the store. We thanked him, and he said ""You guys are nice"", and he was out of the store. It all happened really fast, but it paid for our stuff. We left and his dad or someone was already driving away. He waved, and we did too. It was just really sweet I thought. I hadn't had that happened to me before."
happy,"I was a mess for two decades, booze, coke, just whatever. I have now made it two years without a drink or any coke. I'm so happy right now. I was able to go back to school and I went from a 36 waist to a 30. I later gave up sodas and energy drinks, but alcohol was the tough one. Two years!!!"
happy,"Me (16F) and this one guy friend really like to wrestle every once in a while, its super fun and even though he beats me in height, weight, and strength, I’m pretty persistent and am comfortable getting thrown around haha

We had a pretty long talk laying on some grass after an eventful last practice for an extracurricular, as he’s a hs senior leaving in a couple of days. When i brought up how much i appreciated fighting him (it sounds dumb but you know haha), he said he agreed, but no one else really liked to anymore, even his sister. After that, he said something along the lines of “i think I’m kind of like a big brother to you” and that made me really happy because although i wouldnt realistically call him that ive always seen him in a similar light and as a role model

anyone else love wrestling your friends?"

happy,"I'm working on this AI chatbot app for a college project, and yesterday I encountered some errors causing the whole app to stop functioning and with the submission deadline just days away, I was freaking out. I've spent the last two days trying every fix I could think of but nothing worked. I was honestly starting to lose hope that I'd be able to get this thing running again in time.

This morning, I posted about the issue on a tech forum, desperate for any help I could get. That's when this dude reached out - he'd dealt with a similar error before and offered to walk me through solving it. He spends like 4-5 hours meticulous hours going through my code until we finally isolate and fix the bug. The guy even shared some of his own confidential API keys with me, just to ensure my app could run properly.

A total stranger devoting half his day to helping a random guy on the internet get unstuck. He's got his own shit to worry about, but he still took the time and made the effort, simply out of the goodness of his heart. We're from completely different countries, he doesn't know anything about me , but he came through in the clutch.

It's easy to think the internet is just a cesspool, but then you connect with someone who reminds you that good people are out there. You just have to be lucky enough to find them every once in a while. Somehow I managed to cross paths with this generous soul and now we're internet buddies. It's small acts of kindness like that which restores your faith in humanity. "
happy,"WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WE TAKE THESE DUBS AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

THANK YOU SO MUCH TO MY FUCKING UNIVERSITY MY PROFS MY TAS I HAD TO KEEP IT PROFESSIONAL IN THE EMAIL BUT OH MY GOD THIS IS SO INSANE HOLY FUCK "
happy,"For 24 years I've worked to grow my business.  As a single parent it has been tough.  I missed many precious moments with my daughter and I've always regretted it.  My company has been my second greatest accomplishment next to my daughter.  I'm truly happy to sell it today because I'm selling it to the employees who have done so much to make it great.

I never thought this day would come and it's been an emotional rollercoaster for the last four years. I feared what retirement would mean.  I had an identity crisis coming to terms with not being the boss.  I feared boredom but the pandemic has taught me that I don't need my business.  Connection to my family and hobbies are more than enough to provide fulfillment.

I had a hard time with selling, I built this company and it's a reflection of me.  I've had plenty of offers from larger firms but I don't want to think what would have happened to my company, my employees and it's reputation if some huge conglomerate absorbed it.

It's taken years and I am not getting as much as I could if I sold to a competitor but I'm selling to people who I know will continue the company with the same standards I built it with.  I'm selling to the employees who are the ones that made it all possible. I also know I'm the only one who will be out of a job from this.

It took 4 years to let go and today I finally signed. In a few more months I'll walk away, happily. I have many years left to spend with my family, travel, enjoy my farm, and my horses. I'm truly thankful for the last 24 years and everyone who has made this moment possible.

happy,"So, basically I had 1€ in my bank account, a d my best friend transfered the remaining 5 to me, because we wanted to play a game together that was on sale. I'm so grateful and happy. I'm definitely going to pay him back though, because I would feel bad if I didn't. Besides, it's the right thing to do. He just deserves the world. Of course, I told him that he didn't have to since it's just a game i could get dor the regular price next month, but he insisted so much, because he knew how much I liked the game from watching him play it during shareplay.

As someone has asked this before in this thread : I'm not comfortable sharing private information with strangers such as sharing my PayPal info."
happy,"Edgar (the raven) and Wartholomew (the frog) are Halloween decorations that I've had for a long while and dress in different costumes throughout the year (ex. holidays). They sit in our living room window facing the street.

I've had Edgar since 2020 & Wart since Summer 2023. I dress them in pet costumes (usually for cats or smaller pets like rodents/lizards) since they normally fit the best. 😀

happy,"i'm going home and i'm so happy!

So for some context, I moved out to attend university over 6 months ago. It has been a tough but enjoyable experience so far and i have learnt many new things and made some new friends. Not a bad experience at all. However, i haven't seen my family and my cat (my pride and joy) since i left and i dearly miss them.

Today, my mom and i booked me a flight back home to visit for a whole month. I am so happy that i am full on happy sobbing. It doesn't seem like that much of a big deal, but it is to me and i am beyond excited!"
happy,"I've got some body image issues, depression, and all the other things we all deal with and when I'm feeling low I find post matching my mood and give the positive advice I wish someone would lay down on me, hoping it helps.

Today I responded to one and they dm'd me back and said thanks and even went through a couple of my old post and gave me some advice...how great.

Have a great day everyone, spread the love!"

happy,"I applied at a movie theater the other day, and went there to interview earlier. I had a really cool conversation with one of the managers about working there. Sidebar but I love movies and always talk about them!! I left with confidence thinking I WILL get the job. Lo and behold about two hours after I left that manager called me back and offered me the job! I am so excited to finally work at a movie theater! Like I said I LOVE movies and talking about them so this is like the perfect job for me! I cannot wait to start working for them!"
happy,"I'm big into the local music scene as a local musician, amateur gig photographer, and just general lover of grassroots music. For my birthday, my boyfriend secretly set-up a non-profit music promoter enterprise, booked four of my favourite local bands to play at a local grassroots venues on my birthday weekend, and arranged for all ticket sales to go to one of my favourite local charities! 

It's without a doubt the most thoughtful thing anyone has ever done for me, and I'm totally blown away by it!

happy,"Hey all! I've been on the weightloss train for nearly 3-4 years now! I am only 5',3"", so at my biggest of 215lbs, I was quite heavy for my size. 
I began to simply just eat less, take in less sugar, reduce my portions, and begin walking (10k steps a day). 
Towards the end of my journey I began running and working out as well, which helped me over come plateaus, as well as reducing sugar to nearly 0. 
I am now 120lbs. I may lose 5 more pounds to be 115lbs, but we'll see. It took me nearly half a decade, but I can rest now knowing it is finally accomplished! "

happy,"Guys... I told my crush he's got a cute smile

So, here's how the conversation went: we were walking out of class together, it's the last day of the semester before I can't see him again, and we had this activity where we needed to compliment someone about them. 

We were walking out of class, and I told him: your smile is so, so contagious, Annd immediately he smiles incredibly wide at me, his two small dimples on the sides of his lips show, and it was the cutest thing ever, and super rewarding. Then we walk past a classroom with his friend in it, which he interrupts me, but my crush goes:

""SHUT UP, she's SPEAKING. Continue, please, continue."" So I do, but I tell him that.""Yeah, yeah, I know I'm boosting your ego, but it's like- actually super amazing, and..."" To which my face is pratically melting off, which he points out, telling me my cheeks are beet red.
Then says: 

""It's kinda hot, ngl"" I wasn't sure whether he said, ""Your face is super hot red,"" I was too dizzy from the amount of blush on my face. 

Then I told him it was just adorable and how I was gonna miss it. He's full-on grinning now before he begins to leave. AHHHHHHHHHG"
happy,"NSFW for mention of suicide 

This time last year I was lower than I've been. I remember having to pull my car over because I was crying so hard I couldn't see. I remember sitting with my loaded gun and the only thing that stopped me is kids often go to the park I was in. I remember trying to wreck into a semi after a particularly bad day. For years I was so depressed and so low I never imagined things could be this good. 

But now I wake up everyday overjoyed. I go to work and even though it's work I love it. I shower and I don't sit and cry. I ride with my windows down and sing along to my music and thank my God that I'm alive to see today. That I didn't opt out before I turned 18 like I thought I would. That I made it to 22 like I didn't believe I could. That I wake up today at 25 happier than I've ever been my entire life. I smile and I laugh and I love and I took control of what made my life so awful and kicked its ass until I had full control. 

I think back on all those years I spent unhappy and hating myself and harming myself and I wish I could talk to old me and tell her that it does get better. It takes a long time and alot of shit but you come out on top. 

25 is so young and my life is so full now and I just wanted someone to know. I'm just happy and that's all I've ever wanted and all I'll ever want. I'm just happy to be happy yall"
happy,"Around November of last year I (26F) matched with this guy(26M), he's honestly one of the sweetest guys I've met on a dating app. We were talking for a whole, but had to go out seprate ways, because he was unemployed then and looking for a job and had other things going on in his life. He felt like he couldn't give me time. Which was totally ok and understable. 

Anyway in one of our conversation where he was stressed about not getting a job, I remember giving him a pep talk, and he told me then that when he gets a job I'll be one of the first few people he'll tell. 

It's been around two months since we stopped talking and he texted me today that he got a hired! I'm also suprised that he remembered and texted me about his job. I'm so happy for him. In suprising turn off events in currently unemployed after leaving a toxic workspace and seeing him get a job, made me feel not so bad about my own unemployment. So to whoever is in the same boat. We got this! We'll get a good job that will make us happy."
happy,"I never thought giving a gift would make me so happy. I live in India and my best friend always had this big desire to visit a special place for worshipping Krishna. Unfortunately, that place is very far away. But then I found out there is a similar place much closer to where we live, so I decided to take her there as a surprise.

I didn't tell her where I intended to take her. I just asked her when she had her holidays and around christmas we planned the trip. It took 4 hours to reach there and when we were just about to reach I gave her a note saying 'We will visit your favourite place one day soon. Until that time enjoy this little surprise from me'. When we were at front gate and she realized where we were she became so mesmerised. Seeing her so happy I felt very gratified. That was the first time I realized that love is about giving cause the more you give the more blissful you become.

We visited every temple, the people were chanting Hare Krishna and she was enjoying every little thing. She even took some of the soil from there as a memory. Seeing that she loved my surprise there was different level of joy within me and I truly felt what Sadhguru says 'How deeply you touch another life is how rich your life is'."
happy,"Tomorrow is my 18th birthday. I don't have friends, I don't have a high school diploma, I'm fighting/no contact with almost my entire family, and I work a low paying job. But I'm alive, I have a roof, usually have food. There are a lot of people that can't say the same. I've been severely depressed since I was young, a lot of people told me to ""die"", or that ""I definitely wouldn't make it to adulthood"" (guess what, bitches). Eighteen years old is like a baby that can vote, I have a lot to figure out. I'm just beginning life. 

I'll treat myself tomorrow, I'll order in a LOT of food, and binge watch my favorite movie saga. I'm so proud of myself!!! 😎"
happy,"Today I (17 m) was home alone and started to take out the ingredients (pasta and frozen cubed chicken) but then I thought f*ck it, imma be brave today and boil frozen meat balls in tomato sauce instead of just heating up the chicken in the microwave. It went much better than the last times, I didn’t even think I  would start a fire, unlike the other times. I’m so proud of myself!"
happy,"2020-2024, i didn't want to be lonely because i have so much bad taught on my mind, so i watch movie, series , game , search for friend etc to escape from my reality.
   But in 2023, i decide to juste meditation to face my past trauma and realise the BIG problem in my mind its not that big.
   And i also, start fasting intermittent, its game changer for my, its give me incredible mental clarity and so MUCH energy, so now i control my taught and not contrary.
  Because of this energy, i start to reading books, do more workout, wake 5-6 am, AND I enjoy to be alone

happy,"I just want to say something here that maybe you'll scroll away but I wanted to share it. The thing I want to say is, I am so grateful for my boyfriend. It is Valentine's day today and although we are long distance he always makes me feel special and loved. Like today so far we have messaged but just before he started work we video called. However, he actually makes me feel special not just on days like this but every day. The way he looks at me, thinks of me and strives to make me happy throughout my life just makes me truly appreciate him. He is my support
and my joy. I have not yet recieved the gift or thing that he has planned for today but I know it will be from the heart. So I guess I'm just saying thank you to him in advance of this treatment but mostly thank you for being the man that lights up my days and for being who you are.

I hope we all get or have a partner in our life who makes us feel truly loved."
happy,"I (20f) grew up with an emotionally abusive mother who neglected me and favoured my two older half brothers. I grew up on tv because I was a socially awkward kid and any friends I did have would want to hang with my brothers instead (we have a 6 and 7 year age gap. So when I was 8 they were teens). I saw that on a lot of my favourite shows there would be at least one picnic episode where the family would go to a park with the classic red and white blanket and eat out of a basket. I always wanted that. I would ask my mom if we could do it with her, my brothers and me ( my parents divorced when I was three and my dad had custody on weekends) but my brothers just wanted to go to the skatepark with their junkie friends. My mom chose them over me every time. So when I was 14 I stopped asking cause I knew that the one day I wanted with my family didn’t matter as much as wasting hours watching my brothers do the same old tricks. 
Anyway I haven’t seen my mother since I was 15 when my dad got full custody of me after my mom disappeared with her boyfriend of the week for a couple days. I have a carer cause I was diagnosed with autism at 13. I asked if we could do a picnic one day with just us fully prepared to be rejected but she said yes. So tomorrow we’re buying a basket and food and sitting on a blanket in the park having a picnic. 

Also mom… Fuck you. "

happy,"Growing up I was very thin, but in 2020 I got diagnosed with PCOS I went from 64kgs to 87 kgs over night making all my clothes tight and impossible to wear. I developed and still have body dysmorphia. 
I would always have to buy multiple shein clothes to find something that would fit me. 
Yes plus size exists but I’m one size too small for plus size and one size too big for XL.

Yesterday I went to a shop and found 3 dresses in the style I love 
Which fit me perfectly and had every colour and pattern I wanted I bought 3. But I might god back and get some more. 

I might not be so exciting for others but for me, it made me feel so beautiful and accepted and just happy. "

She said hello to me first and I said, “hey (redacted)!” and we had a nice chat about living here. Sounds like the last person to live in my place was really neat, so I have some cool shoes to fill! 

Hooray for small steps in self improvement and mundane conversations!"
happy,"I love reddit podcasts, but they can be so saddening, especially the stories about pulling ""pranks"" like lying about tragedies or physical harm. I love to do the complete opposite with my boyfriend, and last night was my favorite. He woke up yesterday and the first thing he said to me was ""I am craving white birthday cake."" so I figured, what's a birthday cake without a birthday party? Here's the prank... his birthday is in July. We gave him the ultimate surprise birthday party when he got off his mother's day restaurant shift."
happy,"I work by myself in animal rescue in a place where abandoned animals is pretty common. After my money goes into them and my own groceries, I often have next to nothing to spend on myself. For the last year and a half, I was sleeping on an old donated sofa bed in the main room. But my birthday was last month, and some friends chipped in to buy me the mattress, bed frame, and even new pillows and bedsheets! I did end up building it myself, which took the whole month because I had to find time between running around doing animal stuff, so it feels like my accomplishment too. I just feel so proud of myself and so happy and lucky to have great friends.
